<li>Under these growth conditions ssrAB expression instead depends on other regulators such as OmpR , PhoP and SlyA ( Lee et al. , 2000 ; Feng et al. , 2003 ; 2004 ; Bijlsma and Groisman , 2005 ; Linehan et al. , 2005 ; Fass and Groisman , 2009 ) .

<li>Low Mg2 + enhances PhoP phosphorylation by increasing PhoQ 's autokinase activity ( Montagne et al. , 2001 ) and decreasing its phosphatase activity towards PhoP-P ( Chamnongpol et al. , 2003 , Castelli et al. , 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27282333" target="_blank">27282333</a>]<br></li>
<li>Sal-monella PhoP is known to regulate virulence genes and is required for survival within macrophages ( Fields et al. , 1989 ; Miller et al. , 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10844662" target="_blank">10844662</a>]<br></li>
<li>In S. typhimurium , in addition to regulating housekeeping genes , PhoP also activates numerous virulence genes that are necessary for intramacrophage survival ( Fields et al. , 1989 ; Miller et al. , 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10844662" target="_blank">10844662</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoQ is a membrane protein that activates PhoP in response to low Mg + + concentration ( García Véscovi et al. , 1996 ; Montagne et al. , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25972862" target="_blank">25972862</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon phosphorylation by its cognate histidine kinase PhoQ , PhoP activates or represses transcription of a large regulon , including genes involved in resistance to CAMP ( Fields et al. , 1989 ; Miller et al. , 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507376" target="_blank">14507376</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , PhoPQ , which responds to extracellular cation levels , is thought to repress SPI1 invasion genes while activating expression of pags ( PhoP activated genes ) ( Pegues et al. , 1995 ; Bajaj et al. , 1996 ; VeÂscovi et al. , 1996 ; Groisman , 1998 ) .

<li>PhoP in Salmonella Typhimurium controls the expression of a wide spectrum of genes , some of which are required for virulence , some go beyond its contributions to pathogenicity and are required for physiological control of activities common to other bacteria ( Vescovi et al. , 1994 ; Deiwick et al. , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14738780" target="_blank">14738780</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP and PhoQ comprise a two-compo-nent system that regulates a large number of genes in Salmonella in response to a variety of nutrient starvation conditions ( Kier et al. , 1979 ; Groisman , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12675799" target="_blank">12675799</a>]<br></li>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20593264" target="_blank">20593264</a>]<br></li>
<li>The PhoPQ and PmrAB regulons also are induced by other unknown signals in the intestinal lumen and in macrophages , as PhoP - and PmrA-regulated genes are expressed transiently in the murine intestine before Salmonella uptake by host cells ( Alpuche Aranda et al. , 1992 ; Gibbons et al. , 2005 ; Merighi et al. , 2005 ) .

<li>Once Salmonella is inside host cells or growing in N-MM , SPI-2 genes , which are essential for the systemic phase of the infection ( Cirillo et al. , 1998 ; Hensel et al. , 1998 ; Hansen-Wester and Hensel , 2001 ) , are expressed by a SirA-Csr-HilD-independent mechanism involving other regulators such as OmpR , PhoP and SlyA ( Fass and Groisman , 2009 ) ; whereas expression of the SPI-1 genes is rapidly downregulated following SPI-1-mediated invasion or when growing in N-MM ( Eriksson et al. , 2003 ; Drecktrah et al. , 2006 ; Bustamante et al. , 2008 ) .

<li>FRET also can not detect compounds that bind to the a4-b5-a5 interface to inhibit DNA binding in an allosteric manner , because only the N-terminal of the PhoP response-regulator bound to CFP or YFP was used .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22339993" target="_blank">22339993</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results obtained so far suggested that the compounds might selectively bind to the S. enterica PhoP a4-b5-a5 dimer interface to inhibit formation of the protein-DNA complex , perhaps by an allosteric mechanism .

<li>By analogy to these similar systems , the PhoQ sensor-kinase responds to the acidified macrophage phagosome environment by transfer of phosphate to PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7927792" target="_blank">7927792</a>]<br></li>
<li>SEC was used to better characterize the compounds ' ability to inhibit S. ent-erica PhoP dimerization by measuring the monomer -- dimer profile .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22339993" target="_blank">22339993</a>]<br></li>
<li>The only exception is ugd , which in bacteria having a functional IgaA would be subjected to positive regulation exclusively by the PhoP PmrA route .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15516559" target="_blank">15516559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under these conditions , the ugd gene , included in the cps regulon belonging to the RcsC-YojN-RcsB regulon , is positively regulated by PhoP via PmrA .

<li>( iii ) Different from the low-copy number plasmid ( pYS1010 ) that we used to study regulatory function of the mgtA 50LR in which transcription is only regulated by the 50LR , they determined mgtA transcription , particularly its response to proline , from its chromosomal locus , which , in addition to the 50LR ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) , is regulated by at least two independent promoters controlled by PhoP , in response to the extracytoplasmic Mg ( Garcia Vescovi et al , 1996 ) and Rob 2 þ ( Barchiesi et al , 2008 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21399613" target="_blank">21399613</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , we demonstrated that the PhoP protein is required to promote activation from the pagC promoter in vitro , even when H-NS was not included in the reaction ( Perez et al. , 2008 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>The strain constitutively expressing the PhoP protein was attenuated for virulence in mice , demonstrating that the surge conferred by PhoP 's positive feedback loop is necessary to jump-start Salmonella 's virulence program .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17158330" target="_blank">17158330</a>]<br></li>
<li>This in vivo result suggests that the proposed PhoP box is neither necessary to activate the virK promoter nor necessary to overcome silencing by H-NS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , it is striking that these organisms appear to regulate iraP expression in different ways : the Salmonella PhoP protein regulates iraP transcription directly by binding to distinct sites in the iraP promoter ( Fig. 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16938894" target="_blank">16938894</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the protein is competent to perform autokinase and phosphoryl transfer reactions , the inability of the mutant to fully activate reporter expression is not due to a general defect in protein folding or function but rather is due to a speciﬁc effect on phospho-PhoP stability .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12218035" target="_blank">12218035</a>]<br></li>
<li>The PhoQ protein is a sensor kinase that responds to changes in environmental magnesium concentration by modifying the ability of the PhoP protein to transcribe several genes ( 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8752324" target="_blank">8752324</a>]<br></li>

<li>In this study , a hybrid approach coupling computational and experimental methods was applied to identify drug-like compounds to target the PhoP response-regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22339993" target="_blank">22339993</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP was reported to-bind to the ssrB promoter when Salmonella are inside macrophages [ 46 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20861532" target="_blank">20861532</a>]<br></li>
<li>The supernatant containing the phosphorylated PhoP-H6 was recovered , purified using a Ni21-NTA agarose affinity column to eliminate remnant ATP , applied to a G-50 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer TK to remove imidazole , and immediately used to test phosphorylated PhoP stability or for the phosphatase assay .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP , another regulatory protein involved in acid tolerance , is not involved in induction of acid tolerance by exposure to SCFA as its deletion can lead to even greater survival in Salmonella at low pH , consistent with its role in inorganic acid stress response described above [ 6 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16023758" target="_blank">16023758</a>]<br></li>
<li>This notion has been largely unstudied in in vivo models of bacterial infection , although Salmonella mutants in which the global response-regulator PhoP is constitutively active ( 32 ) are attenuated for virulence in animals .

<li>It is particularly striking that deletion of mgrB results in a strong increase in PhoP-regulated transcription even for growth in 10 mM Mg -- a condition that 2 + strongly represses PhoQ/PhoP signaling in wild-type cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20041203" target="_blank">20041203</a>]<br></li>
<li>We observed that PhoP was up-regulated in the presence of AI-2 molecules compared to its absence , suggesting that AI-2 is involved in modulating PhoP expression in Salmonella Typhimurium ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18361683" target="_blank">18361683</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP induced iraP gene transcription only in organisms grown in 20 M Mg2 ( Fig. 3D ) , which is in striking parallel with the Mg2 concentrations that stimulate accumulation of the RpoS protein in a PhoP-dependent manner ( Fig. 1 A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16938894" target="_blank">16938894</a>]<br></li>
<li>Three acetylated lysine residues were detected in PhoP , including K18 , K150 and K201.Interestingly , K201 was detected more frequently than the other sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>TaiA-2HA was highly produced under PhoP-activating conditions , completely abolished in the DphoP strain and barely detectable when grown in conditions in which PhoP is inactive , as visualized by Western blotting ( data not shown ) .

<li>ZO-1 's appearance in PhoP group was similar as the control group when cells were viewed in cross-Z-section ( Z-section for Control and c PhoP ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18523661" target="_blank">18523661</a>]<br></li>
<li>MgrB inserts in the inner membrane , with its N-terminus in the cytoplasm and C-terminus in the periplasm , and represses PhoQ , resulting in decreased PhoP phosphorylation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20041203" target="_blank">20041203</a>]<br></li>
<li>In our analysis , we identified 29 genes involved in the PhoP regulon as more highly expressed in human samples , including the two component regulator itself , phoPQ ; virk , a virulence protein ; mgtBC , involved in magnesium transport ; pmrF , a antimicrobial resistance-protein ; and slyB , an outer membrane lipoprotein [ 19,20 ] .

<li>Therefore , we wished to compare the PhoPC and PhoP - strains for immunogenicity when used as live attenuated vaccines in mice .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2185222" target="_blank">2185222</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , Salmonella appears to utilize a different mechanism to promote mgtC expression in response to mild acid pH because when bacteria were switched from media at pH 7.7 to media at pH 5.1 , the mRNA levels of the mgtC ( Fig. 1a ) and mgtB ( Fig. 1b ) coding regions increased even in a phoP * phoQ - strain , which lacks the pH sensor PhoQ and harbors a PhoP allele that can function in its absence 19 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22699622" target="_blank">22699622</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to the two-component paradigm , PhoQ would first undergo autophosphorylation in a conserved histidine residue , and the phosphate would in turn be transferred to a conserved aspartate residue in the cognate transcriptional-regulator PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , our results suggest that BaeR can synergize with PhoP in response to the acidification and low cation concentration inside host phagosomes during the infection .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20861532" target="_blank">20861532</a>]<br></li>
<li>We next examined whether the increased ugd transcription linked to the igaA1 mutation could be altered by defects in the regulatory and/or sensor proteins PhoP , PmrA , RcsA , RcsB , and RcsC .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15516559" target="_blank">15516559</a>]<br></li>
<li>As can be seen by the results presented in Fig. 3 , the Crp , Fur , and PhoP proteins are very stable and not subject to breakdown , whereas the RpoS protein displays no stability in the log phase ( 59 ) .

<li>We observed that the PhoP regulon , SPI-1 , SPI-2 and spvR are induced in C. elegans and isogenic strains lacking these virulence factors exhibited signiﬁcant defects in the ability to persist in the worm intestine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18221392" target="_blank">18221392</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP binds to both promoters for the mgtCBR operon and the amgR with different affinities , the former higher and the latter lower , resulting in an initial increase but a subsequent decrease in MgtC protein levels relative to MgtB protein levels in a PhoP-inducing condition such as low Mg2 + media ( Lee and Groisman , 2010 ) .

<li>The absence of transcriptional linkage between the RpoN and the PmrA regulons was corroborated because no signiﬁcant differences were observed when the expression of PmrAcontrolled genes ( pmrI , pmrC , pmrF , and ugd ) was compared either in a RpoN or in a 1 DrpoN strain grown in LB ( exponential or stationary phase ) or in a low-Mg N-21 minimal medium , which are PhoP - and PmrA-inducing conditions ( Soncini & Groisman , 1996 ) ( Fig. 3a and data not shown ) .

<li>3 + As both SPI2 and spv gene expression are induced in vitro in minimal medium low in Mg , it would appear 2 + logical that PhoP would induce the expression of both spv and SPI2 as well , and in particular that PhoP/PhoQ would master the alternate expression between SPI1 and SPI2 .

<li>Given the strong induction in vivo versus that obtainable in vitro , it is possible that PhoP , appropriately activated in the phagosome and itself increased in production , is capable of binding these imperfect sites and directly activating expression of this entire repertoire of genes , which is important for survival in this hostile environment .

<li>Upon analysis of alkaline phosphatase activity , it was shown that both mutations resulted in activation of the pagD : : TnphoA fusion , with PhoP S93N resulting in 65-fold activation and PhoP Q203R resulting in 15-fold activation .

<li>Induction of phoPQ resulted in an increase in b-galactosidase activity in EG9252 , EG5170 , EG9266 , and EG9315 ( Table 2 ) , conﬁrming that both PhoP and PhoQ are necessary for autoregulation of the phoPQ operon .

<li>Reassuringly , many of the phenotypes assigned to S. Dublin SKs in calves mirror those seen with S.

<li>Soni et al. [ 30 ] showed that the LuxS/AI -2 - mediated system in Salmo-nella Typhimurium controls the increased abundance of proteins such as Tig , YaeT , PhoP , GpmI , TrxB , and an unidentiﬁed protein , while PfkA decreased in wild-type Salmonella Typhimurium when compared to luxS mutant .

<li>In this sense , no differences in orgB expression were detected in a pho-24 background compared to that in the wild-type strain , consistent with a compensatory effect due to the presence of two oppositely regulated promoters , with one activated and one repressed by PhoP .

<li>An evaluation to determine transcriptional factors involved in cas3 regulation , as well as those in cas-CRISPR operon , scse2 and ascas2-1 , led to the finding that the CpxR , SsrB , IHF , PhoP , PmrA , FNR , CRP , LRP and OmpR regulators are not involved in the transcriptional control of these transcriptional units ( Fig .

<li>As seen in Fig. 6A and B , addition of 55.5 mM myo-inositol to LB -- 0.3 M NaCl induced expression of srfJ to the same level as that obtained for the iolR mutant in LB -- 0.3 M NaCl in a PhoP - , SsrB - , and RcsB-indepen-dent manner .

<li>To test to what extent the increase in spvA expression that associated with PNPase deﬁciency during propagation in MM5 .8 still depended on the transcription factors PhoP , RpoS , or SpvR implicated in spv gene activation ( 5 , 20 , 21 , 30 , 35 , 43 , 68 , 71 , 84 , 85 ) , we measured - galactosidase activities encoded by pHUB61 ( spvA-lacZ ) in phoP , rpoS , and spvR mutants of MC1 and MC71 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16428774" target="_blank">16428774</a>]<br></li>
<li>These authors also showed that TCRS-mediated gene activation in vivo requires the presence of active PmrA and PhoP , as pmrA and phoP mutants did not express pmrH in response to the in vivo environment ( Merighi et al. , 2005 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22919691" target="_blank">22919691</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , we compared the expression of taiA and clyA in the wildtype strain and in a phoP mutant in growth conditions known to activate ( low magnesium ) or inactivate PhoP ( high magnesium ) ( Garcia Vescovi et al. , 1996 ) .

<li>In examining PhoP - and PmrA-regulated promoter expression in these RIVET experiments , it was clear that no other regulatory system was required for the activation of PmrA-activated genes in vivo because no resolution ( expression ) was observed in PmrA - or PhoP-null backgrounds .

<li>To further confirm that PhoP protein level also responds to acetylation , we examined PhoP expression by Western blot , and showed that it increased in the pat deletion mutant ( Fig 2E ) but decreased after overexpression of pat ( Fig 2F ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , we determined that under anaerobic conditions the expression of hilA was dependent on Fur , and we demonstrated that PhoP was not involved in this regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21075923" target="_blank">21075923</a>]<br></li>
<li>To account for such multi-factorial effects , the rule for H-NS was defined such that H-NS was turned ` OFF ' only in the presence of all five repressors ( HilD , PhoP , SlyA , IHF and Fur ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24079299" target="_blank">24079299</a>]<br></li>
<li>PdgL was not translocated , but possesses a PhoP box as other PhoP-regulated virulence proteins ( e.g. , MgtC , PagK , VirK , PipD ) responding to the intracellular environment [ 47,48 ] and its inactivation rendered Salmonella hypervirulent in mice infection , suggesting its crucial role concerned with Salmonella intracellular fitness [ 49 ] , possibility we are currently examining .

<li>What is interesting in this context is that three components defined as regulatory factors in the ATRs , OmpR , Fur and PhoP , were initially identified as regulators responding to osmolarity or to selected metal ions .

<li>AmgR is PhoP-dependent and PhoP directly binds the amgR promoter , leading to amgR expression in low Mg2 + conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22546935" target="_blank">22546935</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alternatively , PhoP binding to the nonconsensus sodCI site is weak and is only realized under the in vivo induced conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16980468" target="_blank">16980468</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , PmrA-activated genes are turned on in response to Fe3 + sensed by the PmrB protein in a PhoP - , PhoQ - and PmrD-independent fashion ( Wosten et al. , 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15225317" target="_blank">15225317</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been suggested that PhoP responds to the low ionic concentrations inside the phagosome because PhoP/PhoQ regulated genes are repressed at high magnesium and calcium concentrations in vitro ( Garcia Vescovi et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507376" target="_blank">14507376</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although it has been suggested that the Salmonella PhoQ protein senses acid pH ( Aranda et al. , 1992 ) or responds to both pH and Mg2 + ( Bearson et al. , 1998 ) , a direct role for PhoQ in responding to acid pH appears unlikely because not all PhoP-regulated genes are activated under these conditions , which is in contrast to low Mg2 + activating the whole PhoP regulon ( see Groisman and Mouslim , 2006 for a review ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17229213" target="_blank">17229213</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is possible that SsrB can be phosphorylated from other sources as noted by Walthers et al. [ 52 ] or that the overexpression results in dimerization and self activation similar to what has been observed for PhoP [ 78 ] .

<li>We reasoned that AmgR was likely to be transcriptionally controlled by the PhoP protein given that PhoP 's cognate sensor PhoQ is activated during growth in low Mg2 + ( Garcia Vescovi et al. , 1996 ) .

<li>PhoQ stimulation by low extracellular magnesium or cationic antimicrobial peptides ( CAMPs ) leads to increased levels of phosphor-ylated PhoP , which in turn results in increased transcription of mgrB .

<li>In vitro deacetylation assay Deacetylation of PhoP by CobB was performed in deacetylation reaction buffer including 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) , 135 mM NaCl , 2.5 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 in the presence or absence of 1 mM NAD + , and in the presence or absence of 10 mM NAM .

<li>When the series of solubilized PhoQHis was assayed for in vitro global activity by incubating for 20 min with an 8-fold molar excess of PhoP in the presence of [ γ -32 P ] ATP and 5 mM MgCl2 , PhoQHis solubilized in 0.1 % LDAO , DDM or DM retained more than 50 % activity as compared with a non-solubilized control ( Figure 2B ) .

<li>As shown in Fig 5B , there was a 4.11-fold increase of acetylation level in PhoP K201 coupled with the increasing concentration of magnesium from 0 mM to 50 mM .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Figure 6 ( B ) , levels of [ 32P ] phospho-PhoP decreased when assays were performed in the presence of either ADP or p [ NH ] ppA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15910283" target="_blank">15910283</a>]<br></li>
<li>Of note , values for prgB-phoA fusions in strains with a wild-type phoP locus ( Table 3 ) lower than those in PhoPstrains ( Table 2 ) may represent some degree of repression in the presence of PhoP .

<li>The relatively rapid decrease in sspH2 : : f-luc activity in pho-24 mutants after 16 h of growth was probably due to alterations in the physiological state of the bacteria resulting from constitutive activation of PhoP , which may have resulted in nonspeciﬁc alterations in transcription , mRNA stability , translation , or protein stability .

<li>In this article , we establish that the PhoP PhoQ system 2 stabilizes RpoS when Salmonella experience low Mg , primarily by transcriptional control of IraP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16938894" target="_blank">16938894</a>]<br></li>
<li>This could be explained by the aforementioned regulation of SPI2 by PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19737903" target="_blank">19737903</a>]<br></li>

<li>However , our epistasis analysis combining an ssrB null mutation with a phoQ24 activating mutation ( Figure 4 ) clearly showed that the effect of PhoP on sseK1 was SsrB-independent , which is consistent with the induction of sseK1 expression by low Mg + + concentrations but not by low pH. This result also suggested the possibility of direct regulation of sseK1 by PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25972862" target="_blank">25972862</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of the PmrA-dependent loci was induced by either Mg21 limitation or mild acidiﬁcation , whereas transcription of a PmrA-independent gene was activated by Mg21 limitation but not acid pH.

<li>The formation of L-Ara4N and its transfer to lipid A are induced by activation of the transcription factor PmrA , which may occur by mutation ( 30 -- 32 ) , by activation of PhoP ( 33 , 34 ) , or by exposure of cells to mildly acidic pH , ferric ions , or metavanadate ( 26 , 35 , 36 ) .

<li>The PhoQ protein is a sensor for extracellular Mg21 and Ca21 ( 12 , 13 ) that controls-the-activity of PhoP , a transcriptional-regulator that governs expression of some 25 different loci ( 2 , 17 , 18 , 26 , 37 , 38 , 49 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9371451" target="_blank">9371451</a>]<br></li>
<li>The above results indicate that Mg21 neither activates an autophosphatase activity of the response-regulator nor promotes PhoQ dephosphorylation and strongly suggest that a Mg21-induced phosphatase is present and acts on phosphoryl-ated PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is known that prgH is under the regulation of many global regulators , such as HilA , InvF , PhoP , and SirA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28439039" target="_blank">28439039</a>]<br></li>
<li>More importantly , these results show that wild-type PhoP dimerization and interaction with target DNA are independent of phosphorylation , which is in contrast to the previously proposed model .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , this induction is independent of PhoP and PhoQ and is in contrast to the activation that results from Mg21 limitation , which requires both proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8955299" target="_blank">8955299</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our results iterate that PhoP is bound to DNA during growth in LPM ( for either 4 or 20 h ) , which is supported by known activation of the PhoP regulon within acidiﬁed macrophage phagosomes [ 35 ] and during growth under phagosome-mimicking conditions [ 26 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22900174" target="_blank">22900174</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this context , it is important to mention that the growth media which is generally used for PhoP activation in vitro contains high concentrations of Tris ions ( 100 mM ) and micromolar amounts of magnesium ions , conditions that are known to destabilize outer membranes ( Nikaido , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507376" target="_blank">14507376</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylated PhoP ( PhoP-P ) is the active form of the PhoP protein that binds to DNA ( Shin & Groisman , 2005 ) and promotes transcription of PhoP-activated genes ( Shin & Groisman , 2005 , Shin et al. , 2006 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27282333" target="_blank">27282333</a>]<br></li>
<li>Several lines of evidence suggest that PhoP directly activates steA and that the proposed PhoP binding site is functional .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23504014" target="_blank">23504014</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since PhoP is a transcriptional-activator of the iraP ( yaiB ) gene that controls RpoS protein turnover by interacting with RssB [ 39 ] , we postulate that the PhoP/PhoQ and RstA/RstB systems might coregulate iraP to control RpoS , and therefore regulate spvRABCD .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27618760" target="_blank">27618760</a>]<br></li>
<li>We have previously demonstrated that phosphorylated PhoP is the form of the PhoP protein that binds to its target promoters and activates gene transcription in vivo ( 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17158330" target="_blank">17158330</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , it appears that salmonella genes that are involved with infection of mac-rophages ( spv and salmonella pathogenicity island 2 [ SPI2 ] ) are regulated in a manner opposite that of those involved with infection of the intestines ( salmonella pathogenicity island 1 [ SPI1 ] ) , especially with regard to regulation by PhoP and PhoQ ( spv and SPI2 are PhoP activated [ 6 ] ; SPI1 is PhoP repressed [ 1 ] ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11443102" target="_blank">11443102</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results indicated that the RpoS and exopolysaccharide regulons are activated independently of PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507376" target="_blank">14507376</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , transcription initiation from the mgtC promoter is under direct control of the virulence regulatory protein PhoP , which is activated by its cognate sensor PhoQ when Salmonella experiences low Mg2 + ( 32 , 33 ) , mildly acidic pH ( 34 ) , and/or antimicrobial peptides ( 35 ) in its surroundings .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24516160" target="_blank">24516160</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP is a transcriptional-regulator that is activated by PhoQ under conditions of low extracytoplasmic Mg2 concentrations ( 26 ) or acidic pH ( 21 ) and regulates the transcription of more than 50 genes ( 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26396246" target="_blank">26396246</a>]<br></li>
<li>We recently dem-onstrated that when PhoP is overexpressed , it can induce the transcription of its target genes in a PhoQ - and Mg2 - inde-pendent manner ( 35 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16980492" target="_blank">16980492</a>]<br></li>
<li>Salmonella decreases membrane potential during infection by producing MgtC protein [ 3 ] , which can be activated by the PhoP/PhoQ two component regulatory system [ 4 ] , and PhoP is also involved in reversal of membran potential in uropathogenic E. coli [ 17 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25900124" target="_blank">25900124</a>]<br></li>
<li>Subsequently , cytoplasmic transcriptional-regulator protein PhoP is activated by accepting phosphate group from PhoQ to promote the transcription of gene which is important for virulence and survival of S. typhi in host .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26298582" target="_blank">26298582</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since mgrB transcription is activated by phosphorylated PhoP , MgrB is part of a negative feedback loop in the PhoQ/PhoP signaling circuit .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20041203" target="_blank">20041203</a>]<br></li>
<li>CAMP sensing by PhoQ and subsequent PhoP-mediated AP reporter gene activation is abolished in the absence of PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22919691" target="_blank">22919691</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the increase in PhoP levels is dependent on PhoQ and probably is a direct result of PhoP phosphorylation by PhoQ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507376" target="_blank">14507376</a>]<br></li>
<li>The products of these genes , PhoP and PhoQ , constitute a two-component regulatory system , with PhoQ acting as a membrane sensor that , in response to environmental signals , phosphorylates and activates the transcriptional-regulator PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23504014" target="_blank">23504014</a>]<br></li>
<li>To determine whether the PhoP/PhoQ system is activated differently in S. enterica and S. bongori , we investigated expression of the PhoP-dependent phoP gene in bacteria grown under different PhoQ-inducing conditions using a pphoP-gfp fusion given that PhoP positively autoregulates its own expression ( Soncini et al. , 1995 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27282333" target="_blank">27282333</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , we reconstitute the activation surge of PhoP/PhoQ in vitro using purified PhoP and PhoQ proteins , thereby demonstrating that negative feedback regulation is intrinsic to this TCS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22325356" target="_blank">22325356</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the PhoP constitutively active phenotype observed for the PhoP/PhoQ-T 48V and PhoP/PhoQ-T 48I systems is solely due to decreased phosphatase activity of PhoQ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12618457" target="_blank">12618457</a>]<br></li>
<li>virulence regulators , PhoP and PhoQ , activate the transcription of genes ( pag ) within macro-phage phagosomes necessary for resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8955307" target="_blank">8955307</a>]<br></li>
<li>For these reasons , S. enterica PhoP was an attractive target for investigation via struc-ture-based drug design to test the effects of response-regulator inhibition and its potential for virulence regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22339993" target="_blank">22339993</a>]<br></li>
<li>pmrE can be activated in vitro by PhoP , PmrA and RcsB ( RcsC -- YojB -- RcsB phosphorelay ) , all of which can bind to the pmrE promoter directly [ 60 -- 62 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18467098" target="_blank">18467098</a>]<br></li>
<li>This results in the production of phospho-PhoP , which can activate transcription from phoPp1 ( pphoP-1 ) and to a lower extent from phoPp2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7543474" target="_blank">7543474</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , PmrA 's role as a repressor of ssrB transcription is not simply to prevent the PhoP and OmpR proteins from activating ssrB transcription ( 21 , 36 ) because there were similarly low levels of ssaG expression in phoP , phoP pmrA , ompR , and ompR pmrA mutants ( Fig .

<li>Moreover , PhoP is a postulated repressor of hilA ( 8 , 10 , 42 , 81 ) , and RNA levels of both phoP and genes belonging to the PhoP regulon ( e.g. , pagM , mgtB , marB ) ( 43 ) increased upon exposure to SCS .

<li>It remains to be seen , however , if repression is due to a direct interaction of the PhoP response-regulator with the flhCD region or if it operates indirectly , e.g. via the PmrAB two-component system that is also regulated by PhoPQ or through cross-talk with another response-regulator [ 34 , 35 ] .

<li>0002-8236 G 2005 SGM In S. enterica , PhoP is the response-regulator of the PhoP / PhoQ two-component system , which responds to environmental Mg ( Garcia-Vescovi et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this two-component system , the PhoQ protein acts as a sensor for extracytoplasmatic Mg and Ca ( Vescovi et al. 2 + 2 + 1997 ) that controls-the-activity of the response-regulator PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15883881" target="_blank">15883881</a>]<br></li>

<li>b-Galactosidase activity originating from phoPQ-lac transcriptional fusions required the presence of both the transcriptional-regulator PhoP and its cognate sensor-kinase PhoQ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7543474" target="_blank">7543474</a>]<br></li>
<li>The PhoP -- PhoQ -- PmrA -- PmrB pathway of ugd activation in macrophages may be the same as that taking 2 + place in low Mg , where the PhoP -- PhoQ system activates the PmrA -- PmrB system via the PhoP-regulated protein PmrD ( Fig. 1 ; Kox et al. , 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12519186" target="_blank">12519186</a>]<br></li>
<li>We hypothesized that the PhoP PhoQ system might be responsible for the increase in RpoS protein levels taking place in 20 M Mg2 because low Mg2 is the signal that activates the PhoP PhoQ system ( 22 , 32 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16938894" target="_blank">16938894</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data indicated that the PhoQ-T48L sensor barely responds to the absence of Mg2 , suggesting that the Thr-to-Leu substitution locks the protein in a conformation that confers a PhoP constitutively inactive phenotype .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12618457" target="_blank">12618457</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the ugd gene contributes to growth in low Mg2 + ( Soncini et al. , 1996 ) , the signal that activates the PhoP -- PhoQ system .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12519186" target="_blank">12519186</a>]<br></li>
<li>In Salmonella , the PmrD protein enables the Fe3 - responding PmrA PmrB system to also be activated in response to the low Mg2 signal that induces the PhoP PhoQ system .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15569938" target="_blank">15569938</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here we describe a mechanism whereby the transcriptional-activator PhoP elicits expression of dissimilar gene sets when its cognate sensor PhoQ is activated by different signals in the periplasm .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24256574" target="_blank">24256574</a>]<br></li>
<li>To explore this possibility , we examined transcription of the Mg2 transporter mgtA gene , which is directly activated by the PhoP protein ( 25 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19801407" target="_blank">19801407</a>]<br></li>
<li>The OmpB-OmpR two-component system is activated by low osmolarity while the PhoQ-PhoP system , which also regulates SPI-2 genes , senses the acidity of the environment inside the phagosomes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20861532" target="_blank">20861532</a>]<br></li>
<li>We determine that transcription of over half of the genes directly activated by PhoP require the Mg2 + transporter MgtA when the PhoQ inducing signal is low Mg2 + , but not when PhoQ is activated by mildly acidic pH or the antimicrobial peptide C18G .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24256574" target="_blank">24256574</a>]<br></li>
<li>We have now demonstrated that Salmonella utilizes the transporter MgtA to achieve differential expression within the PhoP regulon when the PhoQ inducing condition is low Mg2 + but not when PhoQ is stimulated by mildly acidic pH or an antimicrobial peptide in the presence of high Mg2 + ( Fig. 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24256574" target="_blank">24256574</a>]<br></li>
<li>( A ) When activated at millimolar Mg2 concentrations by the acidic-pH signal , the phosphorylated PhoP protein promotes transcription of the rstA and mgtA genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19801407" target="_blank">19801407</a>]<br></li>
<li>When activated by the low Mg2 + signal , the PhoP regulator promotes synthesis of both the MgtR peptide [ 13 ] and AmgR RNA [ 12 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22155249" target="_blank">22155249</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , in the phoP strains , the spiC promoter would have been activated by both low and high concentrations of Mg2 , the former signal inducing through the PhoP and PhoQ system , the latter one activating directly or indirectly through the second regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12874347" target="_blank">12874347</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the ﬁrst group ( SlyB , PhoP , ArnC , PmrA , ArnA , and ArnB ) , at 8 μM Mg2 + , the protein levels were increased ~ 1.5-fold compared with the average level of the corresponding proteins in the control .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26472331" target="_blank">26472331</a>]<br></li>
<li>SafA elicits a response from the PhoQ sensor to the PhoP regulator even under high Mg2 + conditions when the EvgS1 mutan protein [ 12 ] induces the EvgA-activated safA gene constitutively [ 10 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23031642" target="_blank">23031642</a>]<br></li>
<li>In low-Mg21 media the PhoQ protein would phosphorylate the PhoP protein and the phospho-PhoP would transfer the phosphate to the PmrA protein either directly or by ﬁrst phosphorylating the PmrB protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8955299" target="_blank">8955299</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this approach , we assumed that the induced expression of the RR from a medium-copy-number plasmid circumvented the need for activation by the associated sensor protein -- as we demonstrated to be the case for the homologous PhoP transcriptional-regulator ( 29 ) -- or by other possible phosphodonors , such as acetyl phosphate ( 23 , 49 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17704217" target="_blank">17704217</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , additional experiments are being conducted to further analyze this observation because , even when the same conditions as those employed for phosphotransfer experiments were used , the phosphorylation status of neither PhoP nor PhoQCyt could be evaluated throughout the binding assay .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12702718" target="_blank">12702718</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , expression increased as the distance of the PhoP box to the -10 hexamer increased ( Fig. 4D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>MgtA promotes the active ( i.e. , phosphorylated ) form of PhoP by removing Mg2 + from the periplasm where it functions as a repressing signal for PhoQ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24256574" target="_blank">24256574</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ﬁrst experiment focused on the effect of the Mg2 + concentration on PhoP / PhoQ regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26472331" target="_blank">26472331</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this system extracellular Mg2 interacts with the periplasmic domain of the sensor protein PhoQ , inducing a speciﬁc PhoP-phosphatase activity that controls the phosphorylation state of the transcriptional-regulator PhoP ( 6 , 7 , 9 , 47 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14563863" target="_blank">14563863</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , high concentrations of extracellular Mg2 + stimulate the dephosphorylation of the response-regulator PhoP by the PhoQ kinase sensor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15910283" target="_blank">15910283</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , when Salmonella grows at micromolar concentrations of Mg2 + , the low Mg2 + signal activates the PhoP protein , a response-regulator of the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system [ 7 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22155249" target="_blank">22155249</a>]<br></li>

<li>Although we can not completely rule out the third possibility , we favor the interaction/sequestration alternative as being the dominant cause for down-regulation because : ( a ) when fulllength PhoQ is overexpressed pcgG inhibition is observed even 2 when cells were grown in low Mg , a condition that turns down the phosphatase activity of PhoQ , and ( b ) when we expressed the mutant PhoQ protein , which lacks the phos-H277V pho-PhoP phosphatase activity ( 33 ) , the inhibition of pcgG expression was almost identical to the one obtained for fulllength PhoQ ( Fig. 1B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12702718" target="_blank">12702718</a>]<br></li>
<li>By analyzing in vitro the individual catalytic activities of the PhoQ-T48X sensors , we found that the PhoP constitutively active phenotype observed for the PhoQ-T48V and PhoQ-T48I proteins is solely due to decreased phosphatase activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12618457" target="_blank">12618457</a>]<br></li>
<li>In response to low Mg2 + , the PhoP protein directly activates transcription of the antisense AmgR RNA from the mgtC -- mgtB intergenic region [ 12 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22155249" target="_blank">22155249</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the environmental Mg2 concentration is lowered to micromolar levels , PhoQ promotes the phosphorylated state of the PhoP protein ( 14 , 32 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19801407" target="_blank">19801407</a>]<br></li>

<li>As external Mg2 + concentrations decrease to micromolar levels , the PhoP response-regulator that is activated by the PhoQ sensor promotes transcription of the mgtA gene [ 7,21 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22155249" target="_blank">22155249</a>]<br></li>

<li>Phospho-PhoP was also destabilized when Mg2 was added to the reaction mixture , which is consistent with a ligand-mediated increase in PhoQ 's phosphatase activity ; however , this may simply have been due to a catalytic effect on the dephosphorylation reaction since phospho-PhoP was also destabilized by higher Mg2 concentrations in the presence of PhoQ - SD ( Fig. 7b ) .

<li>Our data , together with previous data in E. coli , suggest a model in which DsbA is a negative regulator of the PhoQ/PhoP system probably through disul-ﬁde bond formation in MgrB : reducing conditions disrupting di-sulﬁde bonds increase PhoQ/PhoP activity , and phosphorylated PhoP binds then to the steA promoter to directly activate transcription of this gene .

<li>A 2þ low concentration of Mg ( micromolar level ) was later discovered to activate more pag genes , while a high concentration of Mg2þ ( millimolar level ) represses them .4 Initial clues linking low Mg2þ concentrations with PhoP/PhoQ activation came from the ﬁnding that PhoP is a direct transcriptional-activator of MgtA and MgtB , two of the three Mg2þ transporters in S. Typhimurium .4,12 In recent years , reconstitution studies using puriﬁed PhoQ in membrane vesicles and NMR analysis showed that sublethal concentrations of cationic antimicrobial peptides ( CAMP ) can activate the PhoQ sensor kinase ,5,13 and acidic pH can be additive with CAMP .6 Although the studies mentioned above demonstrate that PhoP/PhoQ activation can be triggered by several signals in vitro , the relevance of each signal to this system in vivo is widely debated .7,8 The current consensus is that the PhoP/PhoQ system is activated after S. Typhimurium enters phagosomes of host macrophages ,3,11,14 so the ideal experiment for answering these questions is to measure all related factors in vivo .

<li>High concentration of Mg2 + might cause more PhoP dephosphorylation , which subsequently inhibits the PhoPQ to suppress the hilA and hilD , or to activate the pagC in S. Choleraesuis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27886215" target="_blank">27886215</a>]<br></li>
<li>The cross-correlation between the sequence of the PhoP box and its predicted role reveals that PhoP boxes predicted to participate in activation display primarily the S1 and S2 submotifs whereas those anticipated to act in repression display mainly the S3 submotif ( Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ; F statistics , P-value < 0.008 ) .

<li>Phosphorylated PhoP ( PhoP-P ) binds to the mgtC promoter resulting in transcription of the mgtCBR message , and to the amgR promoter to generate a 1.2 kb-antisense RNA that destabilizes the sense mRNA resulting in lower levels of the MgtC and MgtB proteins .

<li>Bacterial genes activated in the vacuole include targets of the PhoQ sensor kinase and the PhoP response-regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12675799" target="_blank">12675799</a>]<br></li>
<li>The sensor protein PhoQ resides in the membrane of the bacterial cell and stops dephosphorylating the response-regulator PhoP when magnesium levels drop to micromolar levels .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25547794" target="_blank">25547794</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , we decided to investigate the possibility that the effect of bile on phoP expression could be the result of a speciﬁc PhoP ligand being present in bile .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22366421" target="_blank">22366421</a>]<br></li>
<li>When exposed to polymyxin , this strain did not exhibit accumulation of PhoP , while the level of PhoP increased in the wild-type strain 14028s , as predicted from the 2-D gel analysis ( Fig. 4C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507376" target="_blank">14507376</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP binds to the upstream region of the macA gene , resulting in regulation of macAB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19230852" target="_blank">19230852</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the presence of the pPC3-2 plasmid resulted in increased resistance to antimicrobial peptides , which was previously known to depend upon the level of activated PhoP in the cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10816543" target="_blank">10816543</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , the mutant protein was unable to promote the dephosphorylation of PhoP even in the presence of added Mg21 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>Extracellular Mg21 has been previously shown to govern the PhoP/PhoQ regulatory system : Mg21 acts as a ligand that changes the conformation of the sensor protein PhoQ in vitro and regulates the transcriptional activity of the PhoP protein in vivo ( 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8955299" target="_blank">8955299</a>]<br></li>
<li>Autophosphorylated PhoQ serves as a phosphodonor of the effector-protein PhoP , which becomes phosphorylated in the predicted Asp-55 residue .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , in the course of the phosphotransfer reaction , PhoP became phosphorylated and it rapidly lost the label when concentrations of MgCl2 higher than 250 mM were present in the reaction , pointing out that the divalent cation was somehow stimulating such dephosphorylation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , when the T438A mutant was incubated with PhoP in the presence of ATP as the sole source of ADP , the levels of PhoP-P decreased more slowly after reaching a peak than with the wild-type PhoQ protein ( Figures 4D , 4E , and 4G ) .

<li>To determine whether activation of PhoP by polymyxin was dependent on the presence of PhoQ , the PhoP protein level was measured in the strain CS009 , which carries the phoQ : : MudJ allele .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507376" target="_blank">14507376</a>]<br></li>
<li>The PhoQ/PhoP system is stimulated by conditions of low extracellular magnesium or the presence of certain cationic antimicrobial peptides ; and it controls genes , whose protein products protect the cell under these conditions or play other critical roles in regulating the virulence of pathogens .

<li>Puriﬁed PhoP and PhoPHis were phosphorylated in the presence of ATP and MgCl2 by using either the PhoQ cytoplasmic domain fused to the GST protein ( GSTPhoQcyto ) or E. coli membranes enriched with the PhoQ-T48I mutant , both of which possess decreased phosphatase activity ( Sanowar et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been estimated that the cellular concentration of PhoP ranges between 2 and 11 mM , depending on the presence of Mg in the growth medium ( Lejona et al. , 2004 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , we could detect only one copy of the repeat in the Salmonella PhoP directly controlled pmrD and pcgL promoters , which required higher concentrations of the response-regulator for the in vitro interaction and , in the case of pcgL , for maximal in vivo expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14563863" target="_blank">14563863</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , we favor the first hypothesis , because in the presence of Mg21 phospho-PhoP showed a half-life of approximately 60 min under nondenaturing conditions and the half-life of the regulators that exhibit autophosphatase activity ranges from seconds in CheY to a few minutes in NtrC and PhoB ( 31 -- 33 ) .

<li>This phoP mutant will aid in the deﬁnition of the unknown molecular events of PhoP interaction with both activated and repressed gene promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10816543" target="_blank">10816543</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , when mutant cells were cultivated in the presence of AI-2 , the abundance of PfkA , Tig , YaeT , PhoP , TalB , GpmI , TrxB , Pta , YiiM , and an unidentiﬁed protein enhanced while the abundance of GroL , OmpF and RpoA descreased [ 30 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27916690" target="_blank">27916690</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both the alteration of the autokinase activity and the increase of the phosphatase activity would result in decreased levels of phos-pho-PhoP and , in turn , in the repression of PhoP-activated genes .

<li>Alternatively , the repression of the PhoP regulon may reﬂect the overall decrease of transcription and translation seen in S. Typhimurium undergoing nitrosative stress ( 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19737903" target="_blank">19737903</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to the constitutively expressed CorA protein [ 5 ] , two common mechanisms allow the MgtA and MgtB transporters to be produced only in low Mg2 + : the PhoP regulator activates transcription of the mgtA and mgtB genes [ 8,9,21 ] , message of which can be fully transcribed by function of the leader sequences [ 10 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22155249" target="_blank">22155249</a>]<br></li>
<li>To determine whether the MgtA protein was necessary for transcription of members of the PhoP regulon other than pagC and pagK , we examined the mRNA levels of 19 additional genes known to be directly activated by the PhoP protein ( Zwir et al. , 2012 ) in isogenic wild-type and mgtA strains following a 4 h incubation in 10 μM Mg2 + .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24256574" target="_blank">24256574</a>]<br></li>
<li>We further observed the decrease of acetylation levels of PhoP K201 in different physiological conditions , including low concentration of Mg2 + , acid stimulation and phagocytosis by macrophages Acetylation coordinates PhoP activity to control the expression of SPIs As we know , phoP has two promoters in S. Typhimurium , the autoregulated P1 promoter and the constitutive P2 promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>The role of PhoP PhoQ in the low-Mg2 activation of the PmrA PmrB system is solely to promote pmrD expression , because pmrD transcription from a heterologous promoter induces PmrA-activated genes even in the absence of the Fe3 and low-Mg2 signals , and independently of the PhoP and PhoQ proteins ( 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12676988" target="_blank">12676988</a>]<br></li>
<li>In low Mg2 + environments , PhoP binds to the intergenic region between the macA and the somA genes , resulting in downregulation of macAB and expression of somA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16359323" target="_blank">16359323</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although it is not the direct subject of this review , the Salmonella PhoP -- PhoQ ( PhoPQ ) system is involved intimately in the function and regulation of the PmrAB TCS and therefore warrants some discussion .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18467098" target="_blank">18467098</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the system is transcriptionally autoregulated , this would increase the amount of both PhoP and PhoQ and result in the subsequent increased level of phos-pho-PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>It seems that the PhoQ protein , localised in the bacterial inner cell membrane , senses low Mg2π and Ca2π , and causes the phosphorylation of PhoP , which in turn activates the expression of pags ( 64 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11886586" target="_blank">11886586</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of mgtA and the mgtCBR operon is dependent on the PhoQP two-component system , in which the inner membrane protein PhoQ carries out phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the DNA-binding-transcriptional-regulator PhoP in response to periplasmic stimuli ( 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27849575" target="_blank">27849575</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of mgtA and mgtCBR is dependent on the PhoQP two-component regulatory system , in which the membrane-bound PhoQ signal sensor phosphorylates the cytoplasmic PhoP protein in response to extracellular signals , and the phosphorylated PhoP protein directly or indirectly regulates transcription of mgtA , mgtCBR and ∼ 8 % of the genes of S. enterica ( Colgan et al. , 2016 ) , including the phoQP operon itself ( Soncini et al. , 1996 ) .

<li>Given that the rate of response is commensurate with the rate of bacterial colonization , the AMPs induction we observed could be in response to speciﬁc bacterial factors produced within the Bacterial persistence in the worm intestine is multifactorial We ﬁnd that PhoP , pSLT and the SPI-1 and SPI-2 type III secretion systems of S. typhimurium are expressed in vivo ( Fig. 1 ) and are required to maintain a stable infection of the nematode ( Fig. 2B , 4B and C ) .

<li>Among the known changes in gene expression profiles between dam and WT Salmonella strains are those that affect cell surface structures ,5,42 some of which can serve as effectors of the innate immune response .10,35 Dam-deficient S. enterica shows both reduced secretion of effectors encoded by the Salmonella-pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) genes and a reduction in the relative amount of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein .42 Like Dam ,3 the two-component PhoP / PhoQ regulatory system also plays a significant role in Salmo-nella virulence .43 For example , the reduction in lipid A acylation by PagL , a deacylase regulated by the PhoP/PhoQ system , decreases the ability of lipid A to induce signaling through the cellular TLR4 .44 Somewhat to our surprise , in cultured macro-phages the dam and dam Salmonella strains were indistinguishable in their ability to elicit the production of IFN - as well as the subsequent activation of IFN-responsive Mx and iNOS gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17477819" target="_blank">17477819</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the inducing signal is limiting , overexpression of PhoQ might lead to an increase in its phosphatase activity , resulting in the displacement of the equilibrium between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7543474" target="_blank">7543474</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under this condition PhoP would become dephosphorylated , and the expression of the PhoP-activated genes would be shut down .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>Firstly , we expressed and purified site-specifically acetylated PhoP ( PhoP K201Ac ) by genetically encoding the incorporation of Nε-acetyllysine in response to the amber stop codon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , we searched for PhoP-regulated genes by using a strategy based solely on the differential transcriptional activities of individual genes in the presence and absence of PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8752324" target="_blank">8752324</a>]<br></li>
<li>The acetylation level of PhoP K201Ac increased dramatically compared with the wild type PhoP without site-specific acetylation As we know , S. Typhimurium responds to environmental divalent cation limitation , including magnesium and calcium by inducing the transcription of the PhoP-PhoQ regulon [ 40 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although phosphorylation of PhoP lowered the concentration required for the shift in the ﬁrst six promoters 2 - to 10-fold , no interaction was observed for the promoter fragments of phoN , pagC , or mgtCB when higher concentrations of PhoP ( 4 M ) or phospho-PhoP were used ( Fig. 3 and data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14563863" target="_blank">14563863</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the homologous lysine residue of PhoP K201 of S. Typhimurium was found to be essential for the PhoP activity in M. tuberculosis [ 31 ] , we hypothesize that acetylation of K201 may be involved in regulating the PhoP activity , specifically the DNA-binding ability of PhoP , considering the location and positive charge of this lysine residue .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>To assess in vitro the global activity of the PhoP/PhoQ-T 48X systems , we reconstituted functional signaling pathways and measured the resulting net phosphorylation of PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12618457" target="_blank">12618457</a>]<br></li>
<li>Together , the decreased levels of PhoP and PhoQ are likely to be responsible for the overall changes in transcription of the PhoP regulon seen after RNS treatment .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18350168" target="_blank">18350168</a>]<br></li>
<li>To determine whether acetylation affects the activity of PhoP as a transcription factor , several known PhoP-regulated genes including mgtA , mgtC , pmrA and pagC were selected to evaluate the role of Pat in the regulation of PhoP activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here we report that induction of the PhoP/PhoQ system results in an initial surge of PhoP phosphorylation ; the occupancy of target promoters by the PhoP protein ; and the transcription of PhoP-activated genes , which then subsides to reach new steady-state levels .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17158330" target="_blank">17158330</a>]<br></li>
<li>Subsequently , the phosphoryl of PhoQ is transferred to the conserved aspartyl of PhoP , and then the phosphorylated PhoP activates the transcription of phoP itself and PhoP-regulated genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>Acetylation inhibits the transcription of phoP and PhoP-regulated genes As a major transcription factor , PhoP regulates the expression of ~ 5 % of genes in S. Typhimur-ium genome , including itself , and the positive feedback boosts the level of PhoP to extend the response range of the PhoP-PhoQ circuit under conditions that strongly activate PhoQ [ 30 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>The membranes harboring phospho-PhoQ were incubated with purified PhoP resulting in the phosphorylation of the response-regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>B , phospho-PhoP was incubated with membranes harboring PhoQ or with the fusion protein MBP-Qc in the presence of 1 mM MgCl2 as described under `` Experimental Procedures .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>In our strains , PhoP is produced at wild-type levels , but nevertheless it is able to turn on transcription from the mgtLA promoter in the constitutively ON mutants even at high Mg2 + concentrations , suggesting that high-level phosphorylation of this protein may not be necessary for the transcriptional activation of this promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27849575" target="_blank">27849575</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , we reasoned that pmrD expression might respond not only to Mg2 in a PhoP PhoQ-dependent manner but also to the activated state of the PmrA PmrB system .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12676988" target="_blank">12676988</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the response-regulator PhoP can not directly activate gene expression in the presence of H-NS unless SlyA is also present to counteract silencing ( 47 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21059643" target="_blank">21059643</a>]<br></li>
<li>To verify that the observed in vitro CAMP sensing by Salmonella was dependent on PhoP-mediated gene activation , AP assays were also performed with a pagJ : : TnphoA PhoP − reporter fusion strain ( Bader et al. , 2003 ) , where AP activity in the presence of peptides was greatly reduced in comparison to the WT pagJ reporter strain ( Figure 1 ) .

<li>The most striking example is fragment H ( Fig. 8 ) , in which three base pair changes , corresponding to sites shown to be critical for PhoP activation of the mgtA promoter in E. coli ( 53 ) , completely abrogated the transcriptional activation in the phoQ24 background .

<li>These studies have given important insights into expression profiles of Salmonella grown in conditions thought to induce the PhoP regulon as well as other regulatory cascades activated in vivo ; however , these studies did not include strains mutant in PhoP , complicating the ability to associate results with the PhoP regulon specifically .

<li>Expression of spv genes is also strongly induced as the bacteria reach the stationary phase in low pH minimal medium low in Mg concentration , which would imply PhoP / 2 + PhoQ as participating in the induction .

<li>As expected , the mRNA levels corresponding to the mgtA LR and the phoP CR were higher in cells experiencing 5 µM Mg2 + than in those exposed to 500 µM Mg2 + ( Figure 5C ) , reflecting that the amount of activated PhoP protein increases as the Mg2 + concentration in the media decreases ( Shin et al. , 2006 ) .

<li>Western blot analysis of extracts prepared from the strain with the wild-type phoPQ promoter revealed that the PhoP protein was detected only in organisms induced in low Mg2 + concentrations , which promoted a continuous increase in the PhoP protein levels during the first 45 min ( Fig. 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17158330" target="_blank">17158330</a>]<br></li>
<li>As suggested by our previous study ( 14 ) , establishing the Mg2 - responsive regulation of these loci requires the transcriptional-repressor H-NS , which antagonizes the functions of SlyA and PhoP ; thus the mRNA level is reduced greatly in the phoP or slyA mutants in PhoP-activating ( low-Mg2 ) conditions but remains high in PhoP-repressing ( high-Mg2 ) conditions in the hns mutant ( Fig. 4B ) .

<li>We found the C18G signal activated only part of the PhoP / PhoQ regulatory network , while low Mg2þ concentrations upregulated more proteins and may even have a connection with RpoS and IHF regulation ( Figures 2 and 5 ) .

<li>We determined that , when RstA protein was induced by IPTG , both the rstA and rstA phoPQ strains displayed 2.8-fold-higher levels of feoB transcription at pH 5.7 than at pH 7.7 ( Fig. 5A ) , indicating that the PhoP and PhoQ proteins are not required for the acidic-pH-promoted RstA activity .

<li>These results indicate that the PhoP and PhoQ proteins are necessary for expression of the PmrA/PmrB system and suggest that genes originally identiﬁed as controlled by PhoP may be regulated via the PmrA protein .

<li>Note that the increased ugd transcription by the igaA1 mutant was promoted by functional RcsC , RcsB , and RcsA proteins , whereas it was independent of PhoP and PmrA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15516559" target="_blank">15516559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , these results indicate that the acid induction of aslA by OmpR and PhoP and its secretion by the TAT system likely have a physiological role in S.

<li>acrAB activation by bile is independent of MarA , Rob , PhoP -- PhoQ and RpoS MarA is believed to mediate enhanced resistance to anti-microbials through activation of the genes encoding the AcrAB efﬂux pump ( White et al. , 1997 ) .

<li>The enhanced RpoS levels resulting from activation of the PhoP PhoQ system is reminiscent of that activating the PmrA PmrB system because it is mediated to a large extent by a small protein ( i.e. , IraP ) that is under transcriptional control of PhoP ( Fig. 3 ) and shown to-bind to the response-regulator RssB ( 21 ) .

<li>pmrD is activated by PhoP , and the PmrD protein is thought to posttranscriptionally regulate the activity of PmrA ( 26 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029036" target="_blank">12029036</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP also positively regulates expression of slyA ( 22 ) and binds to the slyA promoter ( 29 ) , which itself is negatively regulated by binding of the SlyA protein ( 31 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15972530" target="_blank">15972530</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activated PhoP secondarily activates the expression of the PmrA/PmrB system , another two-component signalling system that by itself is responsive to mildly acidic pH and/or Fe3 + , independently of the Mg2 + concentration ( Gunn and Miller , 1996 ; Wosten et al. , 2000 ) .

<li>When the PhoP/PhoQ two component 2 + system is activated by low Mg , phosphorylated PhoP binds to the promoter region of the mgtCBR operon and transcribes mgtCBR messenger RNAs ( Soncini et al. , 1996 ; Shin and Groisman , 2005 ) .

<li>Transcription of the slyA gene is activated during growth in low Mg2 via the PhoP/PhoQ system , and PhoP along with SlyA bind to the ugtL promoter stimulating ugtL transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15208313" target="_blank">15208313</a>]<br></li>
<li>The PhoP/PhoQ system consists of the DNA binding transcriptional-regulator PhoP ( 11 ) and the sensor PhoQ , which responds to low extracytoplasmic Mg2 + ( 12 ) , mildly acidic pH ( 13 ) , and certain antimicrobial peptides ( 14 ) by promoting the active ( i.e. , phosphorylated ) form of PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25624475" target="_blank">25624475</a>]<br></li>
<li>This stabilization requires the PhoP and PhoQ proteins , consistent with the known activation of the PhoP PhoQ two-component system by low Mg2 ( 22 , 32 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16938894" target="_blank">16938894</a>]<br></li>

<li>Overall , this study clearly showed that the S. enterica PhoP protein dimerizes and binds to the mgtA promoter regardless of its phosphorylation state .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP binds to the promoter regions of the phoP , mgtA , slyB , pcgL , and pmrC genes but not to the promoter region of phoN , pagC , or mgtC .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14563863" target="_blank">14563863</a>]<br></li>
<li>Then , phosphorylated PhoP binds to the promoter of the mgtCBR operon and activates transcription initiation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26231375" target="_blank">26231375</a>]<br></li>
<li>These last ﬁndings suggest that RstA overexpression could functionally mimic the effect generated by the switch of the regulator to an activated state , as it occurs with other two-com-ponent RRs , such as PhoP , UphB , and OmpR ( 13 , 26 , 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17704217" target="_blank">17704217</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , this is a short-term response , as within 60 min , the phosphorylated PhoP level returns to the steady-state level , and the expression of PhoP-dependent genes returns to preactivation levels ( 72 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24169575" target="_blank">24169575</a>]<br></li>
<li>We have previously reported that when Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is switched to an inducing environment for the PhoP/PhoQ TCS , the levels of the phosphorylated RR PhoP ( PhoP-P ) rapidly increase , peak , and then decline to reach steady-state levels that are only 20 % -- 25 % of the maximum ( Shin et al. , 2006 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22325356" target="_blank">22325356</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , due to the multicopy nature of the reporter plasmid used , it is conceivable that HilA and PhoP have subtle effects on regulation that were not detected under the conditions tested .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9537377" target="_blank">9537377</a>]<br></li>
<li>This indicates that the role of the PhoP protein is to activate pmrD transcription and not simply to counteract repression by the PmrA protein on the pmrD promoter as proposed for other regulatory proteins such as HilC and HilD ( 28 , 29 ) .

<li>Although full resist-ance to polymyxin B requires ugtL and pmrA , these genes appear to be differentially regulated by PhoP in that transcription of the former ( Fig. 1A ) , but not the latter ,1 is dependent on the SlyA protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15208313" target="_blank">15208313</a>]<br></li>
<li>Inactivation of both ugtL and the regulatory gene pmrA , which controls lipid A modiﬁcations required for resistance to polymxyin B ( but not to magainin 2 ) and is post-tran-scriptionally activated by the PhoP -- PhoQ system , resulted in a strain that was as susceptible to poly-myxin B as a phoP mutant.The most frequently recovered clone harboured the yqjA gene , which we show is PhoP regulated and required for resistance to magainin 2 but not to polymyxin B or defensin HNP-1 .

<li>However , double mutations of DglnA and glnH or of DglnA and glnQ increase the i.p. LD50 to .105 , similar to a strain defective for the virulence-regula-tory protein PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9009317" target="_blank">9009317</a>]<br></li>

<li>Mg2 and Ca2 are thought to act as physiologically relevant signaling ligands by binding directly to the extracellular PhoQ sensor domain and eliciting a conformational change that alters the intracellular enzymatic activities involved in activation of PhoP ( 8 ) .

<li>Accordingly , in vitro retention of PhoQ-derived proteins by PhoP-bound affinity columns showed that the liberated C-ter-minal truncated proteins ( PhoQ and PhoQ , but not Pho-LCyt Cyt QCA ) preserved the capacity , and thus the proper conformation , to effectively recognize and interact with PhoP with a binding strength that overcame subsequent column washes and allowed the elution of the complexes with imidazole .

Cromie ‡ , and Eduardo A. Groisman ‡ § ¶ From the ‡ Department of Molecular Microbiology and the § Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , Missouri , 63110 The PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is a master regulator that governs the ability of Salmonella to cause a lethal infection in mice , the adaptation to low Mg2 environments , and resistance to a variety of antimicrobial peptides .

<li>Therefore , both PhoP-PhoQ and SlyA are active in the same environment , and it is likely that the relationship between PhoP and SlyA identiﬁed here has evolved to integrate some of the responses to the plethora of signals [ for example , Mg ( II ) starvation and acidity ] received while within a host .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12775687" target="_blank">12775687</a>]<br></li>
<li>At low levels of Mg21 , the PhoQ sensor protein phosphorylates and activates the transcriptional-regulatory protein PhoP , which in turn either activates or represses over 40 different genetic loci ( 5 , 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11108722" target="_blank">11108722</a>]<br></li>
<li>Low extracellular cation concentrations , such as those detected within the SCV , and low pH have been reported to activate the sensor kinase PhoQ , which , in turn , activates the regulator PhoP ( 252 ) .

<li>In S.

<li>The environmental signals pH , CAMP , and Mg2 activate PhoQ , which phosphorylates PhoP , which subsequently binds to the promoter regions of target genes , including slyA and the target genes shown in Table S1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19091955" target="_blank">19091955</a>]<br></li>
<li>The membrane peptide MgrB [ 14,15 ] , which corresponds to a single TCS , communicates the activation status of the PhoP regulator to its cognate sensor PhoQ in E. coli and Salmonella [ 15 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23031642" target="_blank">23031642</a>]<br></li>
<li>The sensor PhoQ responds to extracytoplasmic low Mg2 + , acidic pH and antimicrobial peptides by promoting phosphorylation of the PhoP protein , which binds to the mgtCBR promoter resulting in transcription initiation .

<li>In the pho-24 mutant , PhoQ is active even when extracellular cation levels are relatively high , resulting in net phosphorylation of PhoP ( 37 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10714991" target="_blank">10714991</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , PhoP is required for gene activation in the presence of CAMPs ( Bader et al. , 2003 , 2005 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22919691" target="_blank">22919691</a>]<br></li>
<li>The response-regulator PhoP represses the expression of tlpA The distinct expression proﬁle of TlpA in different growth conditions suggested that TlpA is being speciﬁcally regulated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16782389" target="_blank">16782389</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nonetheless , in the absence of phoP inside macrophages , there is still expression of SPI-2 genes , implying that PhoP is dispensable under these circumstances ( 259 , 260 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23554419" target="_blank">23554419</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the presence of PhoQ is required for activation of PhoP upon antimicrobial peptide exposure , it is tempting to speculate that PhoQ directly senses CAMP levels present in host tissues .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507376" target="_blank">14507376</a>]<br></li>
<li>One virulence gene , pagM , is significantly expressed in the absence of PhoP , though it may still require PhoP-PhoQ for induction within macrophage phagosomes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7927792" target="_blank">7927792</a>]<br></li>

<li>The observed greater pagP activation supports the idea that PhoQ is the direct sensor of CAMPs , since PhoQ activation of direct target genes would be stronger than downstream activation of pmrH that occurs through PhoP modulation of PmrA ( Gunn et al. , 1998b ; Kato et al. , 2003 ) .

<li>PhoP upregulates the expression of SPI-2 by directly activating transcription of ssrB , therefore PhoP is indispensible for Salmonella within phagosomes [ 46 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>For instance , a subset of PhoP-activated genes are regulated via PmrA-PmrB ( 41 , 78 ) , while PhoP directly regulates SsrB-SsrA , a regulatory system whose activation is necessary for expression of the SPI-2-encoded T3SS ( 7 ) .

<li>Perhaps our phoN-lacZ reporter system is not sensitive enough to detect small changes in the phosphor-ylation state of PhoP , or repression of E. coli PhoQ signaling by Mg2 and Ca2 may simply differ from repression of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium PhoQ signaling .

<li>Moreover , phagosomal acidification enhances the efficiency of other bactericidal mechanisms such as free radical formation ( superoxide and nitric oxide radicals ) , increased fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes and activation of lysosomal acid hydrolases .8 Phagosomal pH is maintained between 4 to 5 by combined action of v-ATPases and chloride channels present in the vacuolar system .9 Salmonella are of particular interest as they reside in modified phagosomes called SCV and resist killing by modulating phagosomal maturation and also altering the vesicular trafficking of iNOS and NADPH oxidase vesicles.10-12 Furthermore , Salmonella uses acidic pH ( ~ pH 4.5 ) for transcriptional regulation of a subset of PhoP regulated genes13 and assembly of the Salmonella pathogenicity Salmonella enterica comprises a group of Gram-negative bacteria capable of causing clinical syndromes ranging from self-limiting diarrhea to severe fibrinopurulent necrotizing enteritis and life threatening systemic diseases .1,2 During the course of infection , Salmonella encounters several potentially lethal conditions such as the extremely low pH of the stomach , bile salts , reactive oxygen intermediates etc. 3 One of the most frequently encountered hostile conditions by Salmonella is acid stress and hence the ability to sense and respond to the acid stress is crucial for its survival .

<li>Specifically , the conserved lysine residue 201 ( K201 ) in winged helix -- turn -- helix motif at C-terminal DNA-binding domain of PhoP could be acetylated , and its acetylation level decreases dramatically when bacteria encounter low magnesium , acid stress or phagocytosis of macrophages .

<li>Last , PhoP null mutants of P. aeruginosa PAO1 still make 3-O-deacylated lipid A species when grown in the presence of low Mg21 , whereas modifications with 4-aminoarabi-nose and palmitate are lost ( 11 ) .

<li>Therefore , induction of the PhoP regulon by a constitutive mutation ( PhoPc ) in both S. typhimurium and S. typhi resulted in increased survival at extremely high concentrations of bile .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10084994" target="_blank">10084994</a>]<br></li>
<li>A point mutation in phoQ called pho-24 renders the sensor hyperactive , resulting in net phosphorylation of PhoP and activation of pag expression even when extracellular cation levels are high ( 28 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11292791" target="_blank">11292791</a>]<br></li>
<li>Once activated , PhoP can directly activate its own transcription and the transcription of a number of other genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19746165" target="_blank">19746165</a>]<br></li>

<li>Thus , as SpvR is essential for the activation of the expression of Spv effector-proteins such as SpvB ( Rhen et al. , 1993 ) , a role of SpvR could be to sense a factor deﬁning the intravacuolar environment thereby ensuring that activation of RpoS and PhoP as such does not lead to full spv gene expression .

<li>PhoP responds to different structural classes of antimicrobial peptides To test whether PhoP responded to different classes of antimicrobial peptides , we examined two different peptides , the a-helical peptide C18G and the b-sheet peptide protegrin-1 , at concentrations of 5 mg ml-1 and 1 mg ml-1 respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507376" target="_blank">14507376</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although S. enterica PhoP belongs to the same subfamily of response-regulators as OmpR and PhoB , their mechanisms of activation appear to be different .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>Cumulatively , PhoP and SlyA activate transcription of genetic loci including a group of divergent operons by binding to their intergenic regions simultaneously to antagonize the inhibitory effect of H-NS .

<li>The relay of this phosphate to PhoP Asp-55 unleashes the direct or indirect transcription of over 200 loci ( 45 ) , many of which enhance the resistance of S.

<li>Also , availability of a high-resolution crystal structure of PhoP bound to its DNA promoter should better elucidate the conformation of the a4-b5-a5 interface in the biologically active form bound to DNA and provide atomic-level detail of potential binding sites necessary for docking and structure-based drug design .

<li>Martin-Orozco et al. demonstrated that NRAMP1 has no effect on PhoP induction and the bacteriostatic/cidal effect of NRAMP1 is independent of PhoPQ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20634977" target="_blank">20634977</a>]<br></li>
<li>Collectively , these results dem-onstrate that the PreA/PreB-mediated regulation of pmrCAB is independent of PmrA and PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16352830" target="_blank">16352830</a>]<br></li>
<li>The existence of a pair of divergently transcribed genes , one being activated and the other repressed by PhoP ( Fig. 4D ) , is reminiscent of the mode of transcription regulation of the divergently transcribed mgtA and treR genes of E. coli : while mgtA is activated , treR is repressed by PhoP ( Yamamoto et al. , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16359323" target="_blank">16359323</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the PmrA/PmrB sensor regulator pair can be induced through PhoP at low Mg , and independently of PhoP through sensing 2 + of Fe .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15790293" target="_blank">15790293</a>]<br></li>
<li>DNase I footprinting assays conducted in the presence of both PhoP and PmrA proteins revealed that PmrA did not affect binding of PhoP , nor did PhoP affect binding of PmrA to the pmrD promoter ( Fig. 3C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12676988" target="_blank">12676988</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the transcriptional activity of pmrD should be PhoP dependent but PmrA independent , whereas the activity of pmrC should be both PhoP and PmrA dependent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029036" target="_blank">12029036</a>]<br></li>
<li>Levels of PhoP-regulated proteins were decreased or not changed at high Mg2þ concentrations ( Figure S4 of the Supporting Information ) , conﬁrming a direct linkage between Mg2þ concentrations and PhoP activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21563813" target="_blank">21563813</a>]<br></li>
<li>The tested CAMPs induced different levels of PhoP-regulated gene activation , and CAMP-mediated signaling through PhoQ was shown to be dependent on the presence of PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22919691" target="_blank">22919691</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been shown that the transcription of phoP and PhoP-regulated genes were completely inhibited by 10 mM magnesium [ 41 ] , which caused about one third of PhoP K201 was acetylated , suggesting low acetylation proportion of PhoP K201 is required for PhoP activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylation of FP-PhoP was initiated by addition of MgSO4 and phosphoramidate to the mixture of CFP-PhoP , YFP-PhoP , and indicated compounds .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22339993" target="_blank">22339993</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results indicate that low levels of PhoQ stimulate expression of phoPQ , probably by phosphorylating PhoP , and conﬁrm the requirement of PhoP for autoregulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7543474" target="_blank">7543474</a>]<br></li>
<li>The PhoPc strain is a widely used mutant that can increase the net level of phosphorylation of PhoP and lead to an increased level of expression of PhoP-activated genes ( pag genes ) .10,20,26 In this study , we found levels of only PhoP and SlyB increased Figure 3 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21563813" target="_blank">21563813</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that PhoP either directly or indirectly activates slyA expression during exposure of bacteria to low-Mg ( II ) conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12775687" target="_blank">12775687</a>]<br></li>
<li>For PhoP at a concentration of 1 mM , phosphorylation decreased speciﬁc binding by approximately 150 RU , which corresponds to a 1 ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , phosphorylation is required for dimerization of E. coli PhoB ( Fiedler & Weiss , 1995 ; McCleary , 1996 ) , whereas PhoP has been reported to be dimeric inde-BSU pendently of its phosphorylation state ( Liu & Hulett , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>The amount of phosphorylated PhoP surges after activation , then declines to reach a steady-state level .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22325356" target="_blank">22325356</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylation of PhoP mediates activation by causing a conformational change , allowing PhoP to homodimerize .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22339993" target="_blank">22339993</a>]<br></li>
<li>To further determine whether acetylation levels of PhoP K201also responds to magnesium concentrations , the anti-PhoP K201Acspecific antibody was applied to examine acetylation levels of PhoP K201 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>This could be accounted for if this condition produced levels of PhoP that were sufﬁcient to prevent transcription of PhoP-repressed loci but not to induce expression of PhoP-activated genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8752324" target="_blank">8752324</a>]<br></li>
<li>For modiﬁcation of LPS to be effective , it must occur rapidly upon PhoP activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10816543" target="_blank">10816543</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , down-regulation of rpoN during macrophage invasion may provide additional boost to PhoP activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20861532" target="_blank">20861532</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , we consider that acetylated K201 appears to be critical for DNA-binding activity of PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylation of PhoP presumably induces a conformational change to mediate homodimerization for DNA binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22339993" target="_blank">22339993</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to what was observed for PhoP , phosphorylation of PhoPHis signiﬁcantly increased DNA binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>PmrA can also be activated independent of PhoP in response to mild acid pH or high iron concentrations ( 11 , 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15866924" target="_blank">15866924</a>]<br></li>
<li>It suggests that Salmonella may regulate acetylation level of PhoP K201 in response to environmental magnesium concentration .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>7-fold increase in intensity at 346 nm , compared to that of PhoP ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since mutation mimicking acetylation showed that acetylation of K201 inhibited PhoP DNA-binding ability in vivo , we speculate that acetylation level of PhoP K201 might be decreased in macrophage .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>Seven mutants expressed lower levels of b-galactosidase upon PhoP induction , indicating that they carried MudJ insertions in PhoP-repressed loci .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8752324" target="_blank">8752324</a>]<br></li>
<li>This further suggests that these mutations act synergistically to result in the observed high-level PhoP activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10816543" target="_blank">10816543</a>]<br></li>

<li>These results demonstrate that S. Typhimurium promotes PhoP binding affinity to PhoP-regulated genes ' promoters in log-phase ATR by downregulating the acetylation level of PhoP K201 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>

<li>Transcription of ssrB is uncoupled from that of ssrA ( Feng et al. , 2003 ) ; therefore , it is likely that SsrB is expressed in the ssrA mutant and it may still be activated by factors other than SsrA , as has been described , for example , for SlyA , PhoP and OmpR ( Bijlsma & Groisman , 2005 ; Feng et al. , 2004 ; Yoon et al. , 2009 ) .

<li>Because these kinetics are similar to those reported by Garcia-Vescovi et al.

<li>DISCUSSION We previously showed that SrfJ can be secreted through the T3SS2 of S.

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29270156" target="_blank">29270156</a>]<br></li>
<li>SPI1 gene expression is positively regulated by the transcriptional-activators HilA , HilC , and HilD , encoded within SPI1 , and negatively regulated by the regulators HilE and PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18160484" target="_blank">18160484</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alternatively , more recent experiments have shown that PhoP directly activates the orgBC operon , which is located within SPI-1 and indirectly activated by HilA during invasion .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23554419" target="_blank">23554419</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , we show that the sfrABC operon is repressed by both RcsB and PhoP , providing examples of PhoP-re-pressed genes ( prg genes ) that are simultaneously repressed by RcsB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17616593" target="_blank">17616593</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is significant that members of the SsrB regulon are regulated by both OmpR and PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10844662" target="_blank">10844662</a>]<br></li>

<li>We hypothesize that the taiA -- clyA gene cluster is also under co-regulation by SlyA and PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19202096" target="_blank">19202096</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here we show that the srfABC operon is negatively regulated by RcsB and by PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17616593" target="_blank">17616593</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , when the RcsC-YojN-RcsB system is activated by the presence of iron in a pmrA mutant , ugd expression is promoted by both RcsB and PhoP regulators in an RcsA-independent manner ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15516559" target="_blank">15516559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similarly , the expression of slrP , also encoding an effector-protein secreted through both T3SS-1 and T3SS-2 , is controlled by HilD in SPI-1-inducing conditions and by the response-regulator PhoP in SPI-2-inducing conditions32 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27886269" target="_blank">27886269</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is also supported by the central role of the PhoPQ regulon in CAMP resistance as it is well described that PhoP is induced and activated in low pH , low magnesium and low ionic strength environment which is present in macrophage phagolysosomes [ 63 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16023758" target="_blank">16023758</a>]<br></li>
<li>Positive regulation by PhoP is consistent with expression in LPM ( pH 5.8 ) , since the PhoQ sensor is activated in response to low Mg2 concentrations and acidic pH ( 31 , 47 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22661691" target="_blank">22661691</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is noteworthy that when the RcsC-YojN-RcsB system is activated by iron challenge in a pmrA mutant , ugd transcription is directed by RcsB and PhoP in an RcsA-independent manner ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15516559" target="_blank">15516559</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is not surprising because activation of PhoP by its cognate histidine kinase , PhoQ , is dependent on a low [ Mg2 ] , and it is likely that Mg2 is plentiful in the LB media used here ( 9 , 58 ) .

<li>Although rck is not known to be regulated by PhoP , it is coexpressed in vitro with Salmonella genes that are induced within the macrophage vacuole ( C. Detweiler and S.

<li>Given the possibility that PhoP/PhoQ is regulated by Ca2 + and Mg2 + levels in vivo , it is interesting to note that expression of three putative magnesium transporters is regulated by PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11755422" target="_blank">11755422</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is because , first , low Mg2 + activates the PhoP / PhoQ system , which hinders flagella-mediated motility by repres-sing transcription of flagellin ( 9 ) and by decreasing membrane potential , which hinders flagellar rotation ( 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25624475" target="_blank">25624475</a>]<br></li>
<li>The system is activated by mild acid but also by another two-component system , PhoP ± PhoQ , which is activated by both low pH and by decreases in the extracellular concentration of Mg ions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10760151" target="_blank">10760151</a>]<br></li>
<li>One important and extensively studied example is the signaling system controlled by the sensor kinase PhoQ and response-regulator PhoP , which is found in enterics such as Escherichia coli , Salmonella typhimurium , and related bacteria .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20041203" target="_blank">20041203</a>]<br></li>
<li>These transcripts deﬁne two promoters : phoPp1 , which requires both PhoP and PhoQ for activity and which is environmentally regulated , and phoPp2 , which remains active in the absence of PhoP and PhoQ but which is slightly stimulated by these proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7543474" target="_blank">7543474</a>]<br></li>
<li>This set of experiments demonstrated that two promoters transcribe the phoPQ operon : phoPp1 , which is dependent on PhoP and PhoQ for activity , and phoPp2 , which does not require PhoP or PhoQ but which is slightly stimulated by their presence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7543474" target="_blank">7543474</a>]<br></li>
<li>There was no - galactosidase activity in strain YS773 following growth at 5 or 10 mM Mg2 , presumably because the PhoP protein is not activated under such high Mg2 concentrations ( 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19897653" target="_blank">19897653</a>]<br></li>
<li>This effect is not observed in LPM , presumably because the PhoQ/PhoP system is already fully activated in this medium , which mimics intracellular conditions ( 44 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23504014" target="_blank">23504014</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the mgtCB locus , which is also regulated by the PhoP / PhoQ system , is activated in epithelial cells ( 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8955299" target="_blank">8955299</a>]<br></li>
<li>This process requires the two-component regulatory system PhoP PhoQ , which is speciﬁcally activated in low Mg2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16938894" target="_blank">16938894</a>]<br></li>
<li>The low-Mg2 activation requires pmrD , a PhoP PhoQ-activated gene that activates the response-regulator PmrA at a posttranscriptional level .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12676988" target="_blank">12676988</a>]<br></li>
<li>Another well-studied bacterial sensor kinase for which structural information is available is PhoQ , which functions to regulate the response-regulator PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18532985" target="_blank">18532985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Normally , the PhoQ sensor kinase is activated and phosphorylates its cognate transcriptional-regulator , PhoP , when extracellular cation levels are low ( 82 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10714991" target="_blank">10714991</a>]<br></li>

<li>N medium , pH 5.8 , with 10 mM MgCl2 was used for PhoP activation , and N medium , pH 7.4 , with 10 mM MgCl2 was used for PhoP inactivation ( Snavely et al. , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19202096" target="_blank">19202096</a>]<br></li>

<li>PhoQ-derived Proteins Encompassing the DHp Domain Interact with PhoP in an Affinity Retention Assay -- To concentrate in the analysis of the PhoP-PhoQ interaction , we examined the capacity of the soluble PhoQ-derived proteins to interact with PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12702718" target="_blank">12702718</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results suggest that the sensor domain of PhoQ responds to its signal ( s ) by regulating the ability of the kinase domain to destabilize the phosphorylated form of PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12218035" target="_blank">12218035</a>]<br></li>
<li>The H box-harboring domain is key to the function of the Salmonella enterica PhoQ Mg2 - sensor in the recognition of its partner PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14563863" target="_blank">14563863</a>]<br></li>
<li>) Together , these results demonstrate that the extracytoplasmic domains of PhoQ are not essential for the acidic pH activation of the PhoP protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27282333" target="_blank">27282333</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this system extracellular Mg2 interacts with the periplasmic domain of the sensor protein PhoQ , inducing a speciﬁc PhoP-phosphatase activity that controls the phosphorylation state of the transcriptional regulator PhoP ( 6 , 7 , 9 , 47 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14563863" target="_blank">14563863</a>]<br></li>
<li>The integrity of the N-terminal domain of PhoQ was essential for the induc-21 tion of the phosphatase activity , because Mg did not stimulate the release of inorganic phosphate from phos-pho-PhoP in a fusion protein that lacks this sensing-domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>Considering the evidence of both , it becomes clear that the interaction of Mg21 with the N-terminal sensing-domain of PhoQ is essential for triggering its phospho-PhoP phosphatase activity but does not affect the autokinase activity of the sensor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , from this model we envision that a detailed structural knowledge of the protein domain involved in the phosphatase activity of PhoQ and the characterization of the interaction of phospho-PhoP with the active site will provide new clues for understanding the signal transduction mechanism of two-component systems .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>To determine whether the PhoP protein had a transmembrane domain and was similar to ToxR and the B. pertussis product or whether it lacked one like the PhoB protein , we compared the distribution of hydrophobic groups along PhoP and PhoB using the method of Kyte and Doolittle ( 28 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2674945" target="_blank">2674945</a>]<br></li>
<li>DISCUSSION In this study , we examined the effect of phosphorylation on the oligomerization state and DNA-binding ability of the S. enterica PhoP response regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>Altogether , these data strongly suggest that the C-terminal His tag affects the conformation and/or oligomerization state of PhoP , which could explain the unexpected behaviour of unphosphorylated PhoPHis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hypothesizing that a His tag at the C-terminus of the DNA-binding domain may interfere with the ability of PhoP to interact with DNA , we systematically compared the in vitro biochemical properties of PhoP , PhoP ~ P , PhoPHis and PhoPHis ~ P. Strikingly , we found that the His tag speciﬁcally affects the properties of unphosphorylated PhoPHis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoQ subsequently transfers the phosphate group from the conserved histidine of PhoQ to the conserved aspartate on the PhoP response regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22339993" target="_blank">22339993</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results qualitatively indicated that the PhoQ derivatives that retain the H box-harboring domain exhibit the ability to interact with PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12702718" target="_blank">12702718</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this work we sued to identify the PhoQ domain that sustains the specific recognition of PhoP and examined the kinetic parameters that characterize the interaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12702718" target="_blank">12702718</a>]<br></li>

<li>PhoQ harbors two trans-membrane regions that define a large periplasmic domain ( i.e. , 146 amino acids long in Salmonella ) implicated in signal sensing , and a larger cytoplasmic domain ( i.e. , 269 amino acids long in Salmonella ) responsible for interacting with and modulating the activation state of the DNA-binding regulator PhoP ( Miller et al. , 1989 , Groisman et al. , 1989 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .

<li>On the other hand , a G and a C residue replaced the two essential T residues located 29 and 28 nucleotides upstream of the PhoP transcriptional start site in the Salmonella bongori genome ( http : / / www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Salmonella/ ) , and a C residue replaced the 28 T residue in Salmonella enterica subsp .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18532985" target="_blank">18532985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like activation of other members of the two-component family , activation of PhoP requires autophosphorylation of PhoQ and subsequent phosphoryl transfer to PhoP ( 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12218035" target="_blank">12218035</a>]<br></li>

<li>Mass spectrometry showed K201 was acetylated in vivo ( S3 Fig ) and EMSA revealed that K201 was indeed an essential residue for DNA-binding ability of PhoP in S. Typhimurium ( Fig 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is highly possible that other factors may be responsible for the acetylation of PhoP at residues other than K201 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>The lysine 201 ( K201 ) is a key residue for PhoP binding to its promoter region To identify which lysine residues of PhoP were acetylated , we subjected PhoP gel bands for mass spectrometry analysis .

<li>PhoQ is a membrane-bound kinase ( 13 ) that , upon sensing speciﬁc environmental cues ( such as Mg21 concentration [ 8 ] ) , initiates a phosphorylation cascade to activate PhoP , a transcriptional regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10084994" target="_blank">10084994</a>]<br></li>
<li>They also suggest that PhoP is involved in a monomer -- dimer equilibrium that is concentration dependent rather than phosphorylation dependent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16339942" target="_blank">16339942</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon activation , PhoP controls transcription of a large group of genes ( Miller et al. , 1989 ; Belden and Miller , 1994 ; Soncini et al. , 1996 ) , including those involved in resistance to antimicrobial peptides and survival in an acidic environment ( Fields et al. , 1989 ; Miller et al. , 1990 ; Foster and Hall , 1990 ) .

<li>Unlike other microbes ( Piwon et al. , 2000 , Obara et al. , 2008 , Vaughan-Jones et al. , 2009 , Schneider et al. , 2004 ) , S. enterica benefits from an acidic cytoplasmic pH because it activates the sensors PhoQ ( Fig. 5 ) and EnvZ ( Chakraborty et al. , 2015 ) , thereby promoting transcription of PhoP - and OmpR-activated genes , some of which mediate intramacrophage survival ( Fig. 7C ) ( Lee et al. , 2000 ) and virulence in mice ( Fig. 7B and D ) ( Dorman et al. , 1989 ) .

<li>PrgH and SsaG are structural components of the type-III-secretion apparatus and Mig-14 is a protein involved in resistance to AMPs that is dependent on PhoP for expression ( Valdivia et al. , 2000 ; Brodsky et al. , 2005 ) .

<li>PhoP activates genes ( pags ) required for intramac-rophage survival and resistance against host antimicrobial peptides ( Fields et al. , 1989 ; Groisman et al. , 1992 ; Groisman , 2001 ) , and represses genes ( prgs ) , including those encoded in the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) , that are required for invasion-of-host epithelial cells ( Behlau and Miller , 1993 ) .

<li>Then , phospho-PhoP would activate transcription of phoPp1 , resulting in larger amounts of PhoP and PhoQ and increased expression of PhoP-activated genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7543474" target="_blank">7543474</a>]<br></li>

<li>PhoP and PhoQ control expression of more than 40 proteins , including over 15 species in the outer membrane , designated pag ( PhoP-activated genes ) , which promote Salmonella survival within host tissues and prg , ( PhoP-repressed genes ) , which are required for epithelial cell invasion .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11755422" target="_blank">11755422</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regarding expression of SPI-1 genes , PhoP has been reported to repress the prg genes ( for PhoP-repressed genes ) and hilA ( 212 , 253 , 254 ) , whereas on the other hand , PhoP activates transcription of the pag genes ( for PhoP-activated genes ) , which are required for bacterial survival within macrophages ( 255 , 256 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23554419" target="_blank">23554419</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , using LB broth , a condition not usually recognized to support expression of genes involved in intracellular survival , it has been shown that pag genes , controlled by PhoP , and some SPI-2 effectors are expressed ( Belden & Miller , 1994 ; Bustamante et al. , 2008 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19202096" target="_blank">19202096</a>]<br></li>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507376" target="_blank">14507376</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP and PhoQ comprise a two-compo-nent system that regulates a large number of genes in Salmonella in response to a variety of nutrient starvation conditions ( Kier et al. , 1979 ; Groisman , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12675799" target="_blank">12675799</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent work has demonstrated that PhoP activates a number of genes , including the two-component response regulator encoded by pmrA , that are important in Salmonella resistance to PB and some mammalian antimicrobial peptides ( 13 ) .

<li>PhoP regulates its own transcription as well as SlyA , a transcription factor that activates a distinct set of genes ( Norte et al. , 2003 ) and , indirectly , PmrA that activates the LPS modiﬁcation pathway in response to AMPs ( Gunn and Miller , 1996 ) .

<li>In summary , our T-POP-based screens detected PhoP and PhoQ as positive regulators and MgrB as a negative regulator of steA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23504014" target="_blank">23504014</a>]<br></li>
<li>S. Typhi MP is a crude MP comprising > 936 proteins , including several outer membrane proteins ( eg , bacterial chaperonin [ GroEl ] ) and a number of virulence-associated proteins ( eg , PhoP-activated gene C [ PagC ] , sensor kinase [ PhoQ ] , phosphorylated response regulator [ PhoP ] , and HlyE ) [ 21 ] .

<li>This also indicated that mutations which affected two phases of PhoP / PhoQ-regulated gene-expression were additive in their effects on virulence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8392513" target="_blank">8392513</a>]<br></li>
<li>Discovery of first-in-class PhoP inhibitors should serve as a proof-of-concept for targeting TCST response regulators as a novel strategy to inhibit bacterial virulence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22339993" target="_blank">22339993</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , acetylation of K201 ( mimicked by glutamine substitute ) in S. Typhimurium causes significantly attenuated intestinal inflammation as well as systemic infection in mouse model , suggesting that deacetylation of PhoP K201 is essential for Salmonella pathogenesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , PhoP control RpoS-regulated spv genes , which are essential for virulence in the mammalian host ( 56 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17189373" target="_blank">17189373</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taking these ﬁndings together , the PhoP/PhoQ system is likely to play dual roles in iron-homeostasis : PhoP enhances Fe2 uptake when iron is scarce at acidic pH , whereas downregulation of CorA activity at low Mg2 protects Salmonella from Fe2 - mediated killing .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19801407" target="_blank">19801407</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is because , first , low Mg2 + activates the PhoP / PhoQ system , which hinders flagella-mediated motility by repres-sing transcription of flagellin ( 9 ) and by decreasing membrane potential , which hinders flagellar rotation ( 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25624475" target="_blank">25624475</a>]<br></li>
<li>We also found that PhoP , but not PmrA , negatively modulates the expression of gmm , a gene required for colanic-acid-synthesis that is regulated positively by RcsC-YojN-RcsB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15516559" target="_blank">15516559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Concomitantly , PhoP independent of PmrA negatively regulates the cps regulon , ensuring that the ugd gene product is used for lipid A modiﬁcation .

<li>We show that PhoP controls RpoS protein turnover by serving as a transcriptional activator of the iraP ( yaiB ) gene , which encodes a product that enhances RpoS stability by interacting with RssB , the protein that normally delivers RpoS to the ClpXP protease for degradation .

<li>) We ruled out a classical transcriptional cascade model involving the PhoP protein controlling transcription of the slyA gene , which , in turn , would be solely responsible for ugtL transcription because expression of the slyA gene from a heterologous promoter failed to restore ugtL transcription in a phoP mutant although it fully complemented a slyA mutant ( Fig. 1B ) .

<li>PhoP in Salmonella Typhimurium controls the expression of a wide spectrum of genes , some of which are required for virulence , some go beyond its contributions to pathogenicity and are required for physiological control of activities common to other bacteria ( Vescovi et al. , 1994 ; Deiwick et al. , 1999 ) .

<li>PhoP is involved in intra-macrophage survival in Salmonella , and a number of the PhoP-regulated proteins detected in this study are involved in stress response , metabolism , and survival in limiting conditions ( such as those that may be encountered within nutrient deficient macrophage vacuoles ) [ 12,13 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19746165" target="_blank">19746165</a>]<br></li>
<li>Given the strong induction in vivo versus that obtainable in vitro , it is possible that PhoP , appropriately activated in the phagosome and itself increased in production , is capable of binding these imperfect sites and directly activating expression of this entire repertoire of genes , which is important for survival in this hostile environment .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22339993" target="_blank">22339993</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylated PhoP then serves as a transcriptional regulator and directly or indirectly regulates the expression of various genes [ 13 -- 15 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26472331" target="_blank">26472331</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylated PhoP in turn functions as a transcriptional regulator and modulates the 1 3 expression of a variety of genes directly or indirectly .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21563813" target="_blank">21563813</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since PhoP regulates expression of ssrA and ssrB ( Bijlsma and Groisman , 2005 ) , it also regulates expression of genes in the SsrB regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29270156" target="_blank">29270156</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since PhoP controls expression of the response regulator SsrB at the transcriptional level and of the sensor SsrA at a posttranscriptional level ( Bijlsma and Groisman , 2005 ) , it also indirectly regulates expression of SsrB-regulated genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25972862" target="_blank">25972862</a>]<br></li>
<li>Drug-like compounds targeting PhoP , specifically the functionally important a4-b5-a5 interface , should selectively disrupt its function as a transcription factor and inhibit the expression of critical virulence genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22339993" target="_blank">22339993</a>]<br></li>
<li>The OmpR regulator directly activates the transcription of ssrA and ssrB genes ( 9 ) , whereas the PhoP protein does so for ssrB transcription and controls ssrA gene-expression at the posttranscriptional level via an as yet undetermined mechanism ( 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21059960" target="_blank">21059960</a>]<br></li>
<li>In Salmonella enterica , the low-Mg2 - acti-vated PhoP protein directly regulates the transcription of many genes that are necessary for virulence in mammalian hosts , as well as other physiological-processes ( 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19801407" target="_blank">19801407</a>]<br></li>
<li>It was conceivable that this phenotype was not solely due to the presence of PhoP , but also due to the presence of other regulons that responded to antimicrobial peptides , such as genes involved in biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14507376" target="_blank">14507376</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regulation of the taiA invasin by PhoP may seem to contradict its well-accepted function as a regulator of virulence genes involved in intracellular survival , such as the SPI-2 T3SS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19202096" target="_blank">19202096</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the phagolysosome , however , the concentration of Mg is expected to be 2 + low whereupon PhoP becomes increasingly phosphorylated , a state that results in the activation of one set of genes originally termed pags and including genes involved in Mg transport , SPI2 genes , as well as 2 + additional genes for intravacuolar survival ( Garcia Vescovi et al. , 1996 ; Groisman , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15790293" target="_blank">15790293</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the PhoP regulation of resDE , the phosphoresponse regulator is the key species that is involved in repression ( Bir-key et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12753201" target="_blank">12753201</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this two-component system , the PhoQ protein acts as a sensor for extracytoplasmatic Mg and Ca ( Vescovi et al. 2 + 2 + 1997 ) that controls the activity of the response regulator PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15883881" target="_blank">15883881</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to PhoQ , the low-Mg2 induction of PmrA-activated genes requires PhoP ( i.e. , the cognate response regulator of PhoQ ) , the PhoP-activated pmrD gene , as well as the PmrA and PmrB proteins ( 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12676988" target="_blank">12676988</a>]<br></li>
<li>We also identify the magnesium responsive protein MgrB , also known as YobG , and the periplasmic di-sulﬁde bond isomerase DsbA , as negative regulators of steA that act through modulation of the PhoQ/PhoP system .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23504014" target="_blank">23504014</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is consistent with the notion that the PhoQ/PhoP system serves as a master regulator of AMP resistance , whereas the Rcs pathway modulates bacterial resistance to AMPs .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17010160" target="_blank">17010160</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoQ is the sensor kinase/phosphatase that modifies the phosphorylation state of the regulator PhoP in response to stimuli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22325356" target="_blank">22325356</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the case of the facultative intracellular pathogen Salmo-nella enterica serovar Typhimurium , a two-component system that consists of PhoP ( the response regulator ) and PhoQ ( the histidine protein kinase ) has been shown to be a major regulator of virulence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11160113" target="_blank">11160113</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been reported that the PhoP protein , a response regulator of the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system , directly activates transcription of the rstA gene encoding the response regulator RstA in E. coli ( 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18790861" target="_blank">18790861</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , several of these regulators play a master role in the timing of virulence , since they drive the transition from the exponential growth to the stationary phase ( e.g. , Fis and IHF ) as well as from the extracellular to the intracellular environment ( e.g. , PhoQ-PhoP ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23554419" target="_blank">23554419</a>]<br></li>
<li>For instance , PhoP has been recently shown to bind and regulate an internal promoter that drives the expression of the SPI-2 regulator ssrB ( 2 ) , while at the same time , it controls dephosphorylation of the PmrA response regulator via transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding the small protein PmrD ( 22 , 23 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16352830" target="_blank">16352830</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , the PhoP PhoQ system has the ability to activate the PmrA PmrB system posttranslationally by promoting expression of the small basic protein PmrD ( 50 ) , which has been shown to bind to the phosphorylated form of the response regulator PmrA protein and protect it from dephosphorylation by the sensor protein PmrB ( 51 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16938894" target="_blank">16938894</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the case of ResD/E , PhoP functions as a dual regulator , activating transcription of the resABCDE operon under phosphate-depleted conditions and repressing the internal resDE promoter during phos-phate-limited growth ( Birkey et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12753201" target="_blank">12753201</a>]<br></li>
<li>Inhibition on the expression was also obtained when the action of linoleic and linolenic fatty acids were assayed using well-known PhoP-regulated genes other than virK , indicating that the effect was global on the PhoP -- PhoQ controlled regulon ( Viarengo et al. , 2013 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24185747" target="_blank">24185747</a>]<br></li>
<li>We examined the regulation and function of the Salmonella gene mig-14 , which is dependent on PhoP for transcriptional activation within cultured macrophages ( 53 ) and contributes to oral virulence in mice ( 51 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029036" target="_blank">12029036</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , PhoP activates the expression of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase CI ( 27 ) , which is indispensable for full S. Typhimurium virulence in mice and survival within macrophages ( 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19737903" target="_blank">19737903</a>]<br></li>
<li>Despite the activation of assT , dsbL , and dsbI in N-minimal medium , a mutation in the gene encoding the major SPI-2 global regulator , i.e. , PhoP ( 48 ) , had no considerable effect on transcription of assT or dsbL-dsbI ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22343301" target="_blank">22343301</a>]<br></li>

<li>Likewise , the higher expression of tlpA : : lacZ in the phoP mutant indicated that PhoP is involved in the regulation of tlpA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16782389" target="_blank">16782389</a>]<br></li>
<li>Other acetylation factors might be involved in the acetylation of PhoP We here demonstrated that the Gcn5-like acetyltransferase Pat played a major role in the acetylation of PhoP K201 in S. Typhimurium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>

<li>The alignment of the DNase I PhoP-protected sequence located between nt 25 and nt 42 relative to the PhoP-induced transcriptional start site of orgBC ( Fig. 5 , 6 , and 7A ) shows conserved features of the PhoP orthodox promoters identiﬁed in the phoPQ operon and in mgtA , slyB , pcgL , and pmrD ( 30 , 34 ) .

<li>We identiﬁed a putative second PhoP box ( i.e. CTGTTGAGGGGATACTGAT ) resembling submotif S3 ( Fig. 1C ) , in the direct orientation and located 56 nt upstream of the transcription start site , which is similar to the location of PhoP boxes in the pipD and mgtC promoters ( Table 1 ) .

<li>The presence of the putative PhoP box , deﬁned in E. coli as the tandem direct repeat of the heptanucleotide ( T ) G ( T ) TT ( AA ) ( 49 ) , can be distinguished only in the promoter regions of phoP , mgtA , and slyB , whereas a single heptanucleotide sequence can be detected in the promoters of pcgL and pmrD .

<li>Then , we conducted DNase I footprinting assays and found that the PhoP protein binds to two regions of the ugtL promoter : an upstream region harboring an imperfect hexanucleotide repeat resembling a PhoP box but located in the opposite strand , and a 1-proximal region with no resemblance to the PhoP box and overlapping the potential 10 of the ugtL promoter .

<li>The PhoP Binding Sites in the ugtL Promoter Are Required for Binding of the PhoP Protein to the ugtL Promoter in Vitro and for Transcription of the ugtL Gene in Vivo -- To examine the role of the PhoP binding sites in the ugtL promoter , we generated a set of isogenic strains harboring wild-type sequences or nucleotide substitutions at either the upstream or downstream PhoP binding sites in the ugtL promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15208313" target="_blank">15208313</a>]<br></li>
<li>The upstream binding site exhibits higher affinity for the PhoP protein than the second site and consists of sequences partially resembling half of a PhoP box and located in the opposite strand ( Fig. 4C ) , as found in the ugtL promoter .

<li>We then examined the DNA sequence recognized by PhoP in the promoter region of the phoPQ operon as a representative of a directly PhoP controlled promoter ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14563863" target="_blank">14563863</a>]<br></li>
<li>We found that PhoP recognizes the sequence ( G/T ) GTTT A ( A/T ) in the promoter regions of ﬁve of the investigated pag promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14563863" target="_blank">14563863</a>]<br></li>
<li>There are two conceivable explanations for the results described above , as follows : ( i ) PhoP is able to recognize an unusual sequence divergent from the consensus box in the promoter region of orgBC or ( ii ) the orgBC operon harbors an imperfect but still orthodox PhoP box .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16980492" target="_blank">16980492</a>]<br></li>
<li>Using the Gene Promoter Scan ( GPS ) tool ( Zwir et al. , 2005a , b ) , we identiﬁed a sequence resembling the PhoP box in the region upstream of the macAB operon ( Fig. 4B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16359323" target="_blank">16359323</a>]<br></li>

<li>Although divergent from the consensus box sequence , ( G/T ) GTTTA ( A/T ) N4 ( G/T ) GTTTA ( A/T ) ( 34 ) , the alignment of the DNase I PhoP-protected sequence within orgA ( ATTTAT TGAGGAGGCATTGAAGCA ) with the PhoP orthodox promoters ( 30 , 34 ) showed the presence in the orgBC promoter of all established essential residues for PhoP regulation ( Fig. 5 and 6 ) ( 62 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16980492" target="_blank">16980492</a>]<br></li>
<li>This analysis entailed inspecting the promoter sequences for the following features : ( i ) the number of PhoP boxes , ( ii ) the location of the PhoP box ( es ) deﬁned as the distance between the PhoP box and the -10 hexamer sequence predicted to be recognized by RNAP , ( iii ) the orientation of each PhoP box relative to the predicted -10 hexamer sequence , where direct orientation refers to the half PhoP box sequence 5 ′ ( T/G ) GTTTA 3 ′ pointing towards the -10 hexamer sequence , and reverse orientation where the half PhoP box sequence is pointing away from the predicted -10 hexamer sequence , ( iv ) the PhoP box rotational phasing along the DNA with respect to the predicted -10 hexamer , and ( v ) the predicted sequence elements characteristic of promoters recognized by the s70 form of RNAP , including the -10 hexamer , the -35 hexamer and the spacer length between the two hexamers ( Barnard et al. , 2004 ; Shultzaberger et al. , 2007 ) ( Fig. 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>The second PhoP binding site overlaps the putative 10 sequence of the slyA promoter ( Fig. 4C ) , also like the ugtL promoter ( Fig. 2B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15208313" target="_blank">15208313</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the second PhoP box in the ugtL promoter overlaps with the predicted -10 hexamer ( Fig. 2 ) , suggesting that PhoP-P binding to this sequence likely blocks transcription initiation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the overall PhoP binding site differs from consensus , this must be viewed in the context of the L open reading frame .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16980468" target="_blank">16980468</a>]<br></li>
<li>For instance , the pagD promoter was proposed to have a single PhoP box in the direct orientation located 144 nt away from the transcription start site ( Zhao et al. , 2008 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>Likewise , the location of the PhoP box proposed for the pipB2 promoter ( Zhao et al. , 2008 ) is too far away from the RNAP binding site to be functional .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the single PhoP box from the phoP promoter could functionally replace the PhoP box in the pagK promoter located 37 nucleotides from the predicted -10 region ( phoP-revK1 , Fig. 4B ) , and the PhoP box in the mgtC promoter located 48 nucle-otides from the predicted -10 region ( phop-revC , Fig. 4B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>Sequences resembling the PhoP-binding site are not present in the iraP promoter region ( Fig. 5C ) , and the Salmonella PhoP protein does not footprint the E. coli promoter ( unpublished results ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16938894" target="_blank">16938894</a>]<br></li>
<li>We demonstrated that the PhoP protein binds to a site in the intergenic region between the somA gene and the macAB ABC-transporter genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16359323" target="_blank">16359323</a>]<br></li>
<li>The gray boxes correspond to sequences resembling the PhoP box , the black underline to the region protected by the SlyA protein , and the arrow to the transcription start site determined as described in A. Numbering is from the putative start codon of ugtL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15208313" target="_blank">15208313</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , the start codon for the Gifsy-2 L gene is at position 30 in the sodCI promoter and much of the putative PhoP binding site is within the L open reading frame ( Fig. 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16980468" target="_blank">16980468</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the ( G/T ) G in the downstream PhoP half site in the sodCI promoter is not conserved , but these nucleotides correspond to the ATG start codon for L ( Fig. 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16980468" target="_blank">16980468</a>]<br></li>
<li>To characterize the DNA motif required for PhoP to recognize its target genes in the regulon , we mapped the transcription start sites of six PhoP-activated loci .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14563863" target="_blank">14563863</a>]<br></li>
<li>To deﬁne the cis-acting sequences required for RcsB-promoted ugd transcription , we examined the behaviour of derivatives harbouring mutations in the predicted binding sites for the RcsB , PmrA and PhoP proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12519186" target="_blank">12519186</a>]<br></li>
<li>To understand how a bacterial activator might generate varied gene expression behaviour , we investigated the cis-acting promoter features ( i.e. the number of PhoP binding sites , as well as their orientation and location with respect to the sites bound by RNA polymerase and the sequences that constitute the PhoP binding sites ) in 23 PhoP-activated promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>A consensus PhoP binding site has been identiﬁed in E. coli by using the promoters of the genes mgtA and mgrB ( 23 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029036" target="_blank">12029036</a>]<br></li>
<li>Of interest , although ArnB ( PmrH ) is regulated through a PmrA binding site ( a direct repeat of CTTAAT separated by 5 nucleotides ) [ 43 ] , we also found that the PmrA-regulated gene arnB also contains an atypical PhoP box , while the promoter of the gene for the protein Ugd detected in our analysis contains binding sites for PhoP , PmrA , and RcsB [ 44,45 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19746165" target="_blank">19746165</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results show that the fragment from 42 to 12 contains all of the sequence required for PhoP activation and suggest that the identiﬁed consensus PhoP-binding site is critical for this activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16980468" target="_blank">16980468</a>]<br></li>
<li>There is a second PhoP binding site that overlaps the 10 region of the ugtL promoter and does not resemble a PhoP box ( i.e. the PhoP2 site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15208313" target="_blank">15208313</a>]<br></li>
<li>Each construct is a shortened derivative of the corresponding PhoP-activated promoters that includes the most upstream PhoP box and the RNAP binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>Each mutant was constructed by exchanging the conserved TT motif in the middle of a putative half PhoP box sequence for CC ( Figure 5A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25972862" target="_blank">25972862</a>]<br></li>
<li>In one of these mutants ( SM , which stands for silent mutation ) , we replaced the T residues at positions 39 and 29 with C residues , disrupting the two direct repeats recognized by PhoP without affecting the translated sequence of orgA .

<li>Consistent with the notion that being on a particular face of the DNA is necessary for PhoP-promoted gene transcription , there was little expression when the PhoP box was present 23 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 or 32 nt upstream of the -10 hexamer sequence ( Fig. 4D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been proposed that the PhoP protein recognizes the direct hexanucleotide repeat ( T G ) GTTTA , separated by five nucleotides , which has been termed the PhoP box ( 12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15703297" target="_blank">15703297</a>]<br></li>
<li>The PhoP box of the mgtA promoter was prepared by annealing a 59-biotinylated oligonucleotide ( 59-biotin-GGGGTCTGGTTTATC-GTTGGTTTAATTGGGG-39 ; underlined nucleotides indicate the PhoP box ) to a non-biotinylated complementary oligonucleotide ( 59-CCCCAATTAAACCAACGATAAACCAGACCCC-39 ) .

<li>For example , cells harbouring a plasmid with the promoter phoP4 , containing only 52 nt upstream and 5 nt downstream of the PhoP-dependent transcription start site , displayed a behaviour that was virtually identical to that of cells harbouring a plasmid with a longer PhoP promoter fragment that included 112 additional bp upstream ( Fig. 4A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP binds to a single site located 145 nt upstream from the RcsB-dependent transcription start site where it may interact with RcsB and/or alter the ugd promoter in a way that aids RcsB binding and/or recruitment of RNAP ( Mouslim et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the ugd promoter of Salmonella ( Fig. 1B ) , but not of Escherichia coli , harbors a PhoP box that is located much further upstream from an RNA polymerase binding site than in other PhoP-regulated promoters ( Table 3 ) .

<li>Whether transcription of ydeI is directly or indirectly regulated by PhoP , PmrA , and RcsB is unknown , but a putative PhoP-binding site exists 65 nucleotides upstream of the ydeI promoter ( 47 ; data not shown ) .

<li>A comparison of the promoter architectures between foreign and ancestral genes suggests that those that were horizontally acquired bind PhoP ﬂexibly with high variability at a number of positions , whereas those that are part of the core genome interact with PhoP in a conserved manner at one binding site ( Zwir et al. , 2005 , 2012 ) .

<li>Surprisingly , upstream of the PmrA binding site , we found an imperfect direct repeat -- T/GGTTTA -- separated by 5 bp upstream that could correspond to a binding site for the PhoP protein ( Fig. 4B ) because it resembled the upstream regulatory region of other PhoP-regulated genes ( Fig. 4D ; Yamamoto et al. , 2002 ) .

<li>Although we could not successfully carry out footprinting analysis of these two promoters , Kato et al. ( 26 ) recently showed that the pmrD promoter was protected by PhoP in a region that encompasses 42 to 9 bp upstream of the pmrD transcription start site .

<li>Experiments have shown that PhoP controls SsrA posttranscriptionally and directly activates the ssrB gene by binding to its promoter ( 258 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23554419" target="_blank">23554419</a>]<br></li>
<li>The SsrB protein increases its own levels via positive autoregulation ( 4 ) and the OmpR and PhoP proteins also do so by directly activating ssrB transcription ( 9 , 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21059960" target="_blank">21059960</a>]<br></li>
<li>pagC and prgI are known to be activated and repressed , respectively , by the active form of PhoP , and were used as controls .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19202096" target="_blank">19202096</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ugd promoter has binding sites for the PmrA , PhoP and RcsB proteins , and the latter two proteins are necessary to promote ugd transcription under certain inducing conditions ( Mouslim and Groisman , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>More recently , it was found that PhoP / PhoQ , FadD , FliZ , PhoB , SirA , and EnvZ require the URS for modulation of hilA expression , but these factors are not responsible for regulating hilA in response to oxygen and osmolarity ( 38 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11673432" target="_blank">11673432</a>]<br></li>
<li>We establish that full expression of phoPQ requires both PhoP and PhoQ , that two promoters are used to transcribe the phoPQ operon , and that these promoters differ in their response to and dependence on PhoP-PhoQ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7543474" target="_blank">7543474</a>]<br></li>
<li>3 + As both SPI2 and spv gene expression are induced in vitro in minimal medium low in Mg , it would appear 2 + logical that PhoP would induce the expression of both spv and SPI2 as well , and in particular that PhoP/PhoQ would master the alternate expression between SPI1 and SPI2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15790293" target="_blank">15790293</a>]<br></li>
<li>As seen in Fig. 4A and B , PhoP and SsrB were necessary for expression of srfJ in LPM .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22661691" target="_blank">22661691</a>]<br></li>
<li>Only 2 of these 13 orthologous operons contained a PhoP box in their upstream region in both S. typhimurium gene and E. coli ( i.e. , phoPQ and slyB ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15883881" target="_blank">15883881</a>]<br></li>
<li>TaiA-2HA was highly produced under PhoP-activating conditions , completely abolished in the DphoP strain and barely detectable when grown in conditions in which PhoP is inactive , as visualized by Western blotting ( data not shown ) .

<li>Most members of the PhoP regulon , such as phoQ , phoN , virK , pagP , pqaA , cysJIH and cysCND [ 47,48 ] , were repressed by NO in Salmonella grown in EG medium , pH 4.4 ( fig. 5A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18350168" target="_blank">18350168</a>]<br></li>

<li>Although ugd transcription is normally dependent on the PmrA and PhoP proteins ( Fig. 2B ) , the tolB mutation promoted ugd transcription even in strains defective in pmrA , phoP or both pmrA and phoP genes ( Fig. 2B ) , as well as in phoQ and pmrB mutants ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12519186" target="_blank">12519186</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , PmrA 's role as a repressor of ssrB transcription is not simply to prevent the PhoP and OmpR proteins from activating ssrB transcription ( 21 , 36 ) because there were similarly low levels of ssaG expression in phoP , phoP pmrA , ompR , and ompR pmrA mutants ( Fig .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23690578" target="_blank">23690578</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of spv genes is also strongly induced as the bacteria reach the stationary phase in low pH minimal medium low in Mg concentration , which would imply PhoP / 2 + PhoQ as participating in the induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15790293" target="_blank">15790293</a>]<br></li>
<li>But the hyperacetylated PhoP in the cobB mutant did not affect phoP transcription ( S2 Fig ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>As expected , total PhoP levels were the same in isogenic mgtA strains when the phoP-HA phoQ genes were transcribed constitutively ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24256574" target="_blank">24256574</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under these conditions , the ugd gene , included in the cps regulon belonging to the RcsC-YojN-RcsB regulon , is positively regulated by PhoP via PmrA .

<li>By contrast , a PhoP box located 12 nt upstream of the predicted -10 hexamer is required for virK transcription ( Fig. 5D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because having a second PhoP box upstream of a PhoP box located 12 nt upstream of the -10 hexamer increases gene transcription in the ybjX promoter , we wondered whether adding a second PhoP box to a promoter that normally has a single PhoP box increases its expression levels .

<li>PhoP boxes located upstream of the predicted -10 proximal PhoP box stimulate gene transcription ( Fig. 5C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together with the reduced YqjA -- FLAG expression displayed by the phoP + strain grown under PhoP-repressing conditions ( i.e. 10 mM Mg2 + ) ( Fig. 4A ) , these results indicate that PhoP controls YqjA expression .

<li>A gene homologous to mgrB in S. enterica has been shown to be activated by PhoP , suggesting that MgrB is part of a negative feedback loop in the PhoQ/PhoP signaling circuit ( 58 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23504014" target="_blank">23504014</a>]<br></li>
<li>Only the gene immediately upstream and transcribed in a direction opposite to that of pagC ( pagD ) was determined to be PhoP regulated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7665482" target="_blank">7665482</a>]<br></li>
<li>The response regulator PhoP represses the expression of tlpA The distinct expression proﬁle of TlpA in different growth conditions suggested that TlpA is being speciﬁcally regulated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16782389" target="_blank">16782389</a>]<br></li>
<li>Partial complementation due to expression of phoP alone is explained by overexpression of the transcriptional regulator PhoP , which can activate its target genes in a PhoQ-independent manner ( 34 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22661691" target="_blank">22661691</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results indicated that hyperosmolariy increased the secretion of FljB is dependent on PhoP , while the no expression and secretion of FljB in SPI-2 inducing conditions is phoP-independent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27057676" target="_blank">27057676</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nonetheless , in the absence of phoP inside macrophages , there is still expression of SPI-2 genes , implying that PhoP is dispensable under these circumstances ( 259 , 260 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23554419" target="_blank">23554419</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since PhoP regulates expression of ssrA and ssrB ( Bijlsma and Groisman , 2005 ) , it also regulates expression of genes in the SsrB regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29270156" target="_blank">29270156</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of hilA and other SPI1 genes can be transcriptionally regulated by PhoP and SirA , two members of the two-component response regulator family encoded outside SPI1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10322010" target="_blank">10322010</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regulation of SPI2 genes by the two-component system PhoP/PhoQ occurs because PhoP controls expression of ssrB and ssrA at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels , respectively ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22661691" target="_blank">22661691</a>]<br></li>
<li>The PhoP and SlyA protein appear to be part of a feed-forward loop that controls transcription of the ugtL gene and possibly additional PhoP-regulated genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15208313" target="_blank">15208313</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been postulated that the PhoP and SlyA proteins control expression of a group of divergently transcribed genes ( Zhao et al. , 2008 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435712" target="_blank">22435712</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activation of PhoP , as a result of PhoP phosphorylation by PhoQ , represses transcription of hilA and other SPI1 genes ( 2 , 3 , 16 , 37 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10322010" target="_blank">10322010</a>]<br></li>
<li>A direct target of DsbA is SpiA ( also known as FIG 6 The integrity of a putative PhoP box is essential for binding of PhoP and regulation of steA expression by PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23504014" target="_blank">23504014</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP upregulates the expression of SPI-2 by directly activating transcription of ssrB , therefore PhoP is indispensible for Salmonella within phagosomes [ 46 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26943369" target="_blank">26943369</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of this gene is 70 dependent , and the promoter of steA contains a PhoP-binding site that mediates direct regulation by PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23504014" target="_blank">23504014</a>]<br></li>
<li>Maintenance of a basal level of expression of PhoP and PhoQ is driven by a PhoP-independent promoter in the phoPQ operon ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10807931" target="_blank">10807931</a>]<br></li>
<li>The existence of a pair of divergently transcribed genes , one being activated and the other repressed by PhoP ( Fig. 4D ) , is reminiscent of the mode of transcription regulation of the divergently transcribed mgtA and treR genes of E. coli : while mgtA is activated , treR is repressed by PhoP ( Yamamoto et al. , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16359323" target="_blank">16359323</a>]<br></li>

<li>Note that the increased ugd transcription by the igaA1 mutant was promoted by functional RcsC , RcsB , and RcsA proteins , whereas it was independent of PhoP and PmrA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15516559" target="_blank">15516559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of the PmrA-dependent loci was induced by either Mg21 limitation or mild acidiﬁcation , whereas transcription of a PmrA-independent gene was activated by Mg21 limitation but not acid pH. Induction of PmrA-activated genes by Mg21 limitation required the PhoP and PhoQ proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8955299" target="_blank">8955299</a>]<br></li>
<li>We have shown that expression of both virK and somA requires the transcription factor PhoP , whereas rcsC does not .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12675799" target="_blank">12675799</a>]<br></li>
<li>'' As is shown in Fig. 2B , the immunodetection analysis of the proteins that co-eluted with PhoP ( detected also by Western blot ; Fig. 3B ) from Ni2 - NTA resin with imidazole showed that both PhoQLCyt and PhoQCyt , but not PhoQCA , were affinity-trapped with PhoP-H6 .

<li>To determine whether the PhoP/PhoQ system is activated differently in S. enterica and S. bongori , we investigated expression of the PhoP-dependent phoP gene in bacteria grown under different PhoQ-inducing conditions using a pphoP-gfp fusion given that PhoP positively autoregulates its own expression ( Soncini et al. , 1995 ) .

<li>As expected , there was no pbgP transcription when either E. coli or Salmonella was grown in high Mg2 ( Fig. 2 C and D ) , a condition that represses expression of the PhoP PhoQ-activated pmrD gene ( 22 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15569938" target="_blank">15569938</a>]<br></li>
<li>The absence of transcriptional linkage between the RpoN and the PmrA regulons was corroborated because no signiﬁcant differences were observed when the expression of PmrAcontrolled genes ( pmrI , pmrC , pmrF , and ugd ) was compared either in a RpoN or in a 1 DrpoN strain grown in LB ( exponential or stationary phase ) or in a low-Mg N-21 minimal medium , which are PhoP - and PmrA-inducing conditions ( Soncini & Groisman , 1996 ) ( Fig. 3a and data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19076233" target="_blank">19076233</a>]<br></li>
<li>As described in E. coli ( 21 ) , mutation of the Salmonella iraP gene also reduced the accumulation and stability of RpoS during phosphate starvation , independent of PhoP ( Fig. 2C and data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16938894" target="_blank">16938894</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , pH plays a role in the induction of pagP and pmrH gene expression over the course of infection in mouse macrophages , but CRAMP does not appear to play a role in PhoP or PmrA-mediated gene expression even in the absence of phagosome acidiﬁcation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22919691" target="_blank">22919691</a>]<br></li>
<li>This activation was independent of the PhoP and PhoQ proteins and speciﬁc to PmrA-regulated genes because transcription of the PmrA-in-dependent mgtA gene was not signiﬁcantly induced in mild acid pH. However , pbgP transcription was slightly lower in the strain lacking phoP in media containing repressing concentrations of Mg21 ( Fig. 4 ) .

<li>The different promoter architectures driving transcription of the pagD ( Architecture IV ; Fig. 2 ) and the divergent pagC ( Architecture V ; Fig. 2 ) genes suggest they are likely to be independently activated by the PhoP protein [ as opposed to them being co-ordinately transcribed by PhoP-P binding to a single PhoP box as suggested by others ( Zhao et al. , 2008 ) ] .

<li>Activation of steA expression by the PhoQ/PhoP system is further conﬁrmed by the pho-24 mutation increasing steA expression in LB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23504014" target="_blank">23504014</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our results also indicate that the PhoQ/PhoP two-compo-nent regulatory system is the main activator of slrP expression under SPI2-inducing conditions ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25182488" target="_blank">25182488</a>]<br></li>

<li>We determined that , when RstA protein was induced by IPTG , both the rstA and rstA phoPQ strains displayed 2.8-fold-higher levels of feoB transcription at pH 5.7 than at pH 7.7 ( Fig. 5A ) , indicating that the PhoP and PhoQ proteins are not required for the acidic-pH-promoted RstA activity .

<li>RpoS , PhoP , CRP and Fis may be important for the proper hlyE expression inside macrophages , since the RpoS and PhoP respective regulons are activated inside these cells ; and both crp and fis expression is repressed in the same environment [ 41,43 ] .

<li>For example , one of the profiles encompassed promoters that belong to the same expression ( E1 ) , PhoP box submotif ( M2 ) , and promoter class ( P1 ) ( Fig. 1H ) and harbored not only the prototypical PhoP-regulated phoP and mgtA promoters ( 13 , 14 ) but also the yhiW promoter , which was not known to be under PhoP control .

<li>In Fig. 1B , the immunoblot intensity analysis demonstrated that occludin and ZO-1 expression c was significantly increased by the presence of PhoP with AvrA protein expression , whereas the AvrA-deficient strain ( AvrA2 ) and wild-type Salmonella 14028s with insufficient AvrA protein induced a significantly less in ZO-1 and occludin expression .

<li>Several lines of evidence suggest that PhoP - and PmrA-regulated genes are activated in the phagosome of professional phagocytes in response to its acidiﬁcation ( 1 ) and that this represents the major site of expression of both regulons .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16237024" target="_blank">16237024</a>]<br></li>
<li>By deﬁnition , PhoP-repressed genes should be maximally expressed under conditions that result in minimal expression of PhoP-activated genes : either in the absence of PhoP or in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Mg21 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8752324" target="_blank">8752324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , as PhoP-P positively regulates its own transcription ( Soncini et al. , 1995 ) , which results in a continuous increase of PhoP-P levels during the ﬁrst 30 min of the bacterium experiencing inducing conditions ( Shin et al. , 2006 ) , promoters having two PhoP boxes , one of which located downstream of or overlapping the predicted -10 region , may give rise to a time-dependent expression over a particular time period .

<li>Thus , it might be deduced that once inside the SCV , PhoP activates the pag genes , which in turn reduce hilA transcription through HilD and eventually trigger repression of the prg genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23554419" target="_blank">23554419</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regarding expression of SPI-1 genes , PhoP has been reported to repress the prg genes ( for PhoP-repressed genes ) and hilA ( 212 , 253 , 254 ) , whereas on the other hand , PhoP activates transcription of the pag genes ( for PhoP-activated genes ) , which are required for bacterial survival within macrophages ( 255 , 256 ) .

<li>In the absence of a functional PhoP protein , enhanced expression of the siiA and siiE genes is observed ( 214 , 225 ) , whereas in the background of phoP ( Con ) ( constitutive for PhoP ) , a strong reduction in the siiA expression has been reported ( 214 ) .

<li>The role of PhoP PhoQ in the low-Mg2 activation of the PmrA PmrB system is solely to promote pmrD expression , because pmrD transcription from a heterologous promoter induces PmrA-activated genes even in the absence of the Fe3 and low-Mg2 signals , and independently of the PhoP and PhoQ proteins ( 13 ) .

<li>Acetylation inhibits the transcription of phoP and PhoP-regulated genes As a major transcription factor , PhoP regulates the expression of ~ 5 % of genes in S.

<li>In the case of ResD/E , PhoP functions as a dual regulator , activating transcription of the resABCDE operon under phosphate-depleted conditions and repressing the internal resDE promoter during phos-phate-limited growth ( Birkey et al. , 1998 ) .

<li>This indicates that the role of the PhoP protein is to activate pmrD transcription and not simply to counteract repression by the PmrA protein on the pmrD promoter as proposed for other regulatory proteins such as HilC and HilD ( 28 , 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12676988" target="_blank">12676988</a>]<br></li>
<li>Binding of the PmrA and PhoP proteins to the pmrD promoter was not mutually exclusive ( Fig. 3C ) , ruling out that the PmrA protein represses pmrD transcription by inhibiting binding of the PhoP protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12676988" target="_blank">12676988</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP also controls expression of Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 ( Spi-2 ) by binding to the ssrB promoter region and the 5 ′ - UTR of the spiR transcript ( Belden and Miller , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26441883" target="_blank">26441883</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the strain expressing the PhoP protein constitutively was shifted from repressing ( 10 mM ) to inducing ( 50 mM ) Mg2 + concentrations , binding of PhoP to the mgtA and pmrD promoters ( Fig. 3C ) and transcription of the respective genes ( Fig. 3D ) increased during the first 10 min and then asymptotically reached the steady-state levels displayed by the strain with the wild-type phoPQ promoter ( 15 ) .

<li>We used strains in which the chromosomal copy of the phoPQ operon had been deleted and that harbored a plasmid with the phoP-HA and phoQ genes under the control of a derivative of the lac promoter ( 14 ) because a strain with a chromosomal phoQ mutation encoding a phosphatase-defective PhoQ would constitutively activate the PhoP protein .

<li>Therefore , even if transcription of mgtA and mgtCBR is promoted at millimolar Mg2 + concentrations by the acidic pH-activated PhoP [ 11 ] , both the MgtA and MgtB transporters are not expressed due to the function of the leader sequences [ 10,11 ] .

<li>Summary The Salmonella ugd gene is required for the incorporation of 4-aminoarabinose in the lipopolysaccharide and resistance to the antibiotic polymyxin B. Transcription of the ugd gene is induced by Fe3 + via the PmrA -- PmrB two-component system and by low Mg2 + in a process that requires the PhoP -- PhoQ two-component system , the PhoP-activated PmrD protein and the PmrA -- PmrB system .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12519186" target="_blank">12519186</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcriptional activation of the ugd gene by the RcsC -- YojN -- RcsB system and RcsA protein We have established that the tolB-promoted expression of the ugd gene occurs by activation of the RcsB and RcsA proteins and is independent of the PhoP -- PhoQ and PmrA -- PmrB systems because it occurs in a phoP pmrA double mutant ( Fig. 2B ) .

<li>Among the known changes in gene expression profiles between dam and WT Salmonella strains are those that affect cell surface structures ,5,42 some of which can serve as effectors of the innate immune response .10,35 Dam-deficient S. enterica shows both reduced secretion of effectors encoded by the Salmonella-pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI-1 ) genes and a reduction in the relative amount of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein .42 Like Dam ,3 the two-component PhoP / PhoQ regulatory system also plays a significant role in Salmo-nella virulence .43 For example , the reduction in lipid A acylation by PagL , a deacylase regulated by the PhoP/PhoQ system , decreases the ability of lipid A to induce signaling through the cellular TLR4 .44 Somewhat to our surprise , in cultured macro-phages the dam and dam Salmonella strains were indistinguishable in their ability to elicit the production of IFN - as well as the subsequent activation of IFN-responsive Mx and iNOS gene expression .

<li>The ﬁnding that neither the expression level of the CorA protein nor its membrane location is affected by the PhoP protein implies the presence of a PhoP-regulated gene product ( s ) regulating CorA activity ( 8 ) .

<li>As PhoP is a negative regulator of the hilA expression , this decreased expression can not account for the downregulation of the hilA gene by the ﬂiZ mutation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11162188" target="_blank">11162188</a>]<br></li>
<li>The mgtCB operon encodes another Mg2 transporter , MgtB , whose expression is also determined at the transcription level by the PhoP protein and at the posttranscription level by the leader preceding the ﬁrst gene in the operon ( 9 , 37 ) .

<li>The regulatory region including the SlyA and PhoP boxes of the pipB gene is located within the coding region of a putative protein gene STM1089 , whereas the farther left flanking region , STM1090 ( the pipC gene ) , is transcribed in the same direction as the pipB gene .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19091955" target="_blank">19091955</a>]<br></li>
<li>To explore this possibility , we examined transcription of the Mg2 transporter mgtA gene , which is directly activated by the PhoP protein ( 25 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19801407" target="_blank">19801407</a>]<br></li>
<li>The corA gene is constitutively expressed ( 8 ) , whereas transcription of the mgtA and mgtB genes is directly activated by the PhoP protein ( 25 , 43 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19801407" target="_blank">19801407</a>]<br></li>
<li>In parallel , additional sets of genes illustrated by the prgs and yet others located on SPI1 , become repressed by PhoP / PhoQ at low concentration of the divalent-cations .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15790293" target="_blank">15790293</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that the cellular redox status is a factor contributing to regulation of steA and , probably , other virulence genes regulated by the PhoQ/PhoP two-component system .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23504014" target="_blank">23504014</a>]<br></li>
<li>PhoP also positively regulates expression of slyA ( 22 ) and binds to the slyA promoter ( 29 ) , which itself is negatively regulated by binding of the SlyA protein ( 31 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15972530" target="_blank">15972530</a>]<br></li>

<li>The PhoP and PhoQ proteins are encoded in a bi-cistronic operon that is transcribed from two promoters : a constitutive promoter that provides the basal levels of these proteins required for sensing and responding to changes in environmental conditions , and a regulated promoter that is activated by the PhoP protein transcription in two isogenic strains : one with the wild-type phoPQ promoter [ that is , harboring the PhoP box that is responsible for transcriptional autoregulation ( 13 ) ] and one in which the PhoP box was replaced by a consensus -- 35 sequence ( Fig. 3A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17158330" target="_blank">17158330</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , the macA and macB genes were expressed to higher levels in a phoP mutant than in the wild-type strain ( Fig. 4A ) , suggesting that these genes are repressed by PhoP as low Mg2 + is the signal that activates the PhoP/PhoQ system ( Groisman , 2001 ) .

<li>efp enables differential expression of genes that Pro respond to proline-tRNA levels gene because , like mgtC , it is regulated by the PhoP / absence of the efp gene ( Fig. 2B and supporting inforPhoQ two component system at the transcription initia - mation Fig .

<li>Although full resist-ance to polymyxin B requires ugtL and pmrA , these genes appear to be differentially regulated by PhoP in that transcription of the former ( Fig. 1A ) , but not the latter ,1 is dependent on the SlyA protein .

<li>Our results from primer extension demonstrate that transcriptions of the identified loci are activated by PhoP and SlyA because the mRNA level of transcripts is reduced significantly in the phoP and slyA mutants grown in low-Mg2 conditions ( Fig .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19091955" target="_blank">19091955</a>]<br></li>
<li>This demonstrates that there is little transcription of the pmrHFIJKLM genes in the absence of PmrA and that direct activation of the promoter is mediated by PmrA and not PhoP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11035717" target="_blank">11035717</a>]<br></li>
<li>This ﬁnding is somewhat reminiscent of a recent study of the PhoP regulon across multiple genomes , which found that the only targets directly regulated by PhoP in all species were the phoPQ operon itself and its negative regulator slyB ( 36 ) .
