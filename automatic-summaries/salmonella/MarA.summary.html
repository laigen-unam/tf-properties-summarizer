[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15155237" target="_blank">15155237</a>]<br></li>
<li>AcrAB regulation is mediated by five regulators : MarA , SoxS , Rob , AcrR and RamA ( Bailey et al. , 2008 ; Ma et al. , 1996 ; Randall & Woodward , 2002 ; Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ; Schneiders et al. , 2003 ) .

In Escherichia coli , AcrAB is regulated by three activators , MarA , SoxS and Rob , and one repressor , AcrR ( Ma et al. , 1996 ; Randall & Woodward , 2002 ; Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21148208" target="_blank">21148208</a>]<br></label>

<li>In addition to RamA , AcrAB is regulated by three activators , MarA , SoxS and Rob , and one repressor , AcrR ( Ma et al. , 1996 ; Randall & Woodward , 2002 ; Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21148208" target="_blank">21148208</a>]<br></li></div>
<li>Prouty et al. ( 47 ) further reported that acrAB activation by bile is independent of MarA , Rob , PhoP/PhoQ , and RpoS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18577510" target="_blank">18577510</a>]<br></li>
<li>In Enterobacter aerogenes , increased OmpX expression is caused by elevated levels of the transcriptional-regulator MarA ( Barbosa and Levy , 2000 ; De Dupont et al. , 2004 ) , known to confer multiple antibiotic resistance ( Gambino et al. , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18399940" target="_blank">18399940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Its expression is modulated precisely by its local repressor , AcrR , as well as by global transcriptional-regulators of the AraC family , RamA , MarA , SoxS , and Rob ( Nikaido et al. , 2008 ; Kehrenberg et al. , 2009 ; P√©rez et al. , 2012 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28261566" target="_blank">28261566</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , the expression of acrAB is regulated by the global regulators , RamA , SoxS , MarA , and Rob ( Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ; Abouzeed et al. , 2008 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23503095" target="_blank">23503095</a>]<br></li>
<li>ompW is positively regulated by MarA and SoxS We previously demonstrated that SoxS positively regulates ompW in response to paraquat ( Gil et al. , 2009 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23393149" target="_blank">23393149</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our results are in agreement with other studies performed in E. coli where rob was shown to be negatively regulated by both MarA and SoxS by a direct interaction with its promoter region ( Schneiders and Levy 2006 ; MichaÃÅn et al. 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752112" target="_blank">22752112</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , previous work indicates that rob is repressed by MarA due to steric hindrance and in E. coli SoxS modulates its expression in response to paraquat ( McMurry & Levy , 2010 ; MichaÃÅn et al. , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23393149" target="_blank">23393149</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , acrAB transcription in Salmonella is controlled by AcrR , a TetR-like repressor encoded nearby , and by the AraC/XylS-like regulators RamA , MarA , SoxS and Rob , involved in stress - and virulence-response ( Bailey et al. , 2010 ; Nikaido et al. , 2011 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28631419" target="_blank">28631419</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of rob is negatively regulated by MarA and SoxS in response to sodium salicylate and paraquat , respectively ( Pomposiello et al. 2001 ; MichaÃÅn et al. 2002 ; Schneiders and Levy 2006 ) .

<li>The marA / soxS/rob regulons overlap and MarA , SoxS , and Rob co-regulate , by direct binding , more than 40 different genes ( Aono et al. 1998 ; Martin et al. 1999 , 2000 ; Martin and Rosner 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752112" target="_blank">22752112</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this work , we demonstrate that both SoxS and MarA , whose response overlap and together co-regulate over 40 genes ( Aono et al. , 1998 ; Martin et al. , 1999 , 2000 ; Martin & Rosner , 2002 ) , were required for the positive regulation of ompW after menadione treatment ( Figs 2 and 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23393149" target="_blank">23393149</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , in E. coli , Rob , a global regulator with homology to MarA , independently regulates genes also regulated by MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15073288" target="_blank">15073288</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to mediating increases in MarA synthesis they can also directly activate tolC and acrAB genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16842216" target="_blank">16842216</a>]<br></li>

<li>As shown in Fig. 1A , and in contrast to Rob , neither SoxS nor MarA overexpression upregulated mgtA transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18487336" target="_blank">18487336</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses suggest that MarA and SoxS are required to positively regulate ompW in response to menadione , while Rob is not involved in this response .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23393149" target="_blank">23393149</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , in response to menadione ArcA could be inactive , allowing MarA and SoxS to exert their regulation , although this has not been evaluated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23393149" target="_blank">23393149</a>]<br></li>
<li>Notably , although MarA , SoxS and Rob independently activate a shared set of genes , they have different quantitative effects on particular promoters ( 18 , 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19120970" target="_blank">19120970</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results are interesting , as MarA and probably also Rob are known activators of AcrAB , and are expected to increase its transcription when they are overexpressed ( 51 , 16 , 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19120970" target="_blank">19120970</a>]<br></li>

<li>Like marRAB , acrAB and tolC are positively regulated by MarA , SoxS , and Rob ( 2 , 7 , 25 , 32 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11036033" target="_blank">11036033</a>]<br></li>

<li>In E. coli it is modulated at the lowest level by the local repressor AcrR .14 At a more global level , acrAB expression is modulated by stress conditions and by global regulatory genes , such as marA , soxS , and rob .14,17,18 The acrAB locus is indeed part of the mar , sox , and rob regulons of E. coli , the activation of which confers a low-level resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents and organic solvents .17 Previous studies clearly showed that overexpression of marA , which results from marR mutations , would down-regulate the expression of acrR , thus inducing high-level AcrAB expression and antimicrobial resistance .23 Proteins encoded by the mar locus include the transcriptional-activator , MarA , its local repressor , MarR , and MarB and MarC , two proteins with unknown functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16201927" target="_blank">16201927</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of MarA is further activated when MarA binds marbox in the operator of marRAB .7 MarA not only regulates its own expression , but also the expression of many genes involved in adaptation to stress conditions , such as oxidative-stress , heavy metals or antimicrobials .10 A well-known example of an adaptive phenotype controlled by MarA is increased tolerance to antibiotics such as tetracycline , chloramphenicol and Ô¨Çuoroquinolones ,11,12 and to other anti-microbial compounds such as triclosan13 and pine oil .14 This is achieved mainly due to control of efÔ¨Çux by up-regulation of 15 the AcrAB-TolC efÔ¨Çux pump and control of inÔ¨Çux by the induction of micF ,13,16 which encodes an antisense RNA involved in the regulation of outer membrane protein F ( OmpF ) , through which hydrophilic substances enter the cell .

<li>The marRAB operon is responsible for producing the MarA transcriptional-activator protein ,6 which can be synthesized in response to the presence of antibiotics and can result in the multi-drug resistance phenotype ( MDR ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23453941" target="_blank">23453941</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , these results suggest that an increase in the levels of MarA and SoxS increase the resistance to NaOCl while Rob overexpression results in an increased sensitivity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752112" target="_blank">22752112</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because RamA displays close homology to MarA , SoxS , and Rob , the suggestion was made that RamA mediates MDR in Klebsiella via activation of the mar locus .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15155237" target="_blank">15155237</a>]<br></li>

<li>MarA is induced following salicylate treatment ,5 SoxS in response to superoxide and Rob following treatment with bile salts and dipyridyl .6 -- 8 Up-regulation of these transcription factors has been shown to increase the expression of several genes , including acrAB and tolC .5,9,10 Although MarA , SoxS and Rob are present in Salmonella , studies have shown that the transcriptional-activator RamA , which is not present in E. coli , plays the dominant role in the regulation of AcrAB -- TolC in Salmonella and other Enterobacter-iaceae .11 -- 17 To date , few inducers of RamA have been reported ; however , Nikaido et al. 18,19 demonstrated increased expression of ramA in response to the bacterial metabolite indole , and that acrAB induction by indole is dependent on RamA .

<li>Mutations in marR , soxR and ramR lead to an increase in the expression of the transcriptional-activators MarA , SoxS and RamA , respectively , which in turn interact with the acrAB promoter , thereby increasing the amount of AcrAB produced and effectively enhancing efÔ¨Çux .

<li>S. enterica strains with the tolC gene experimentally deleted show an increased susceptibility to antimicrobial agents .14 Similarly , strains of S. enterica showed higher susceptibility to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin when ramA was inactivated .15 Although several studies have been conducted in recent years to elucidate the structure , function and signiÔ¨Åcance of AcrB , 16 -- 18 MarA , SoxS and RamA , their regulation in S. enterica is not fully understood .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23453941" target="_blank">23453941</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this study , before the strains were induced with GEN , CpxR overexpression led to signiÔ¨Åcant reductions in levels of AcrB , TolC , MarA , and SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27199934" target="_blank">27199934</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that under the assayed conditions , ArcA is not active , since , as observed in the presence of NaOCl , when ArcA , MarA and SoxS are present , ompW is negatively regulated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23393149" target="_blank">23393149</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is plausible to speculate that under those conditions ArcA could bind to the 235 element and impede binding of the sigma factor , explaining why , although both MarA and SoxS are present , ompW is negatively regulated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23393149" target="_blank">23393149</a>]<br></li>
<li>Other regulators , SoxS and MarA , are also known to regulate acrAB expression , but the contributions of SoxS and MarA to antimicrobial susceptibilities are lower than that of RamA ( Abouzeed et al. , 2008 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23503095" target="_blank">23503095</a>]<br></li>
<li>Further studies addressing whether this is a common feature of regulation of gene expression by MarA and SoxS , novel targets subject to similar regulation , and the mechanism by which these proteins interact are under examination in our laboratory .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23393149" target="_blank">23393149</a>]<br></li>
<li>When grown in the presence of SAL or when containing plasmids expressing MarA , S. typhimurium strains that are Ec capable of infection in BALB/c mice were less susceptible to different classes of antibiotics than were less virulent S. typhi-murium and E. coli strains ( Table 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9068629" target="_blank">9068629</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data suggest that exposure to antimicrobials that are AcrAB substrates enhance the activation of the AcrAB efÔ¨Çux pump via RamA , but not via SoxS , MarA , or Rob in S. Choleraesuis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23503095" target="_blank">23503095</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , micF and acrAB are also induced by stress signals in additional ways that are not dependent on the marRAB system .17 Interestingly , antibiotics that serve as substrates of the AcrAB efÔ¨Çux pump are very weak inducers of the marRAB operon in E. coli and do not induce these genes in Salmonella .6,8 Based on that , it was suggested that exposure of E. coli or S. enterica to salicylate activates MarA through binding to its repressor , MarR .

<li>This conÔ¨Årms our previous results that repression of rob in the complemented strains in the presence of arabinose must have been due to overexpression of MarA or SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752112" target="_blank">22752112</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data suggest that overproduction of MarA in the absence of acrF is independent of a decrease in the level of soxS expression ; this could be a secondary effect of the increase in the level of acrB expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15047514" target="_blank">15047514</a>]<br></li>
<li>It was suggested that several potential mechanisms may reduce the activity of quinolones intracellularly : ( i ) intracellular bacteria only poorly respond to the antibiotic due to the low growth rate ; ( ii ) lower uptake by the intracellular bacteria ; and ( iii ) the activity is defeated by the local environment in the host cells , such as low pH. 29 The results of this study demonstrate that exposure of Salmo-nella in macrophages to salicylate induces the expression of MarA , but does not affect the resistance to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20237076" target="_blank">20237076</a>]<br></li>
<li>Studies in E. coli indicate that MarA indirectly represses ompF , reducing the number of porins in the outer membrane and activates transcription of acrAB to increase the number of efÔ¨Çux pumps in the membrane ( Alekshun & Levy , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15073288" target="_blank">15073288</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our results with extracellular Salmonella conÔ¨Årm previous in vitro studies that showed induction of low levels of resistance to multiple antibiotics in various bacterial species by salicylate , including resistance to Ô¨Çuoroquinolones , the drugs of choice for treating bacteraemic enteric fevers due to Salmonella .2,6,26,27 To validate that the salicylate-dependent increase in tolerance in broth is mediated through MarA , which activates the expression of AcrAB , we investigated the effect of salicylate on the activity of ciproÔ¨Çoxacin against marA null mutant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20237076" target="_blank">20237076</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results , together with the results of the induction of marA , micF and acrAB by salicylate in broth at 378C , and the lack of the induction of acrAB by salicylate in the DmarA mutant strongly support the hypothesis that the salicylate-dependent increase in tolerance to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin in broth at 378C is mediated by the induction of MarA by salicylate , which in turn activates the expression of the AcrAB efÔ¨Çux pumps , leading to a reduction in ciproÔ¨Çoxacin accumulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20237076" target="_blank">20237076</a>]<br></li>
<li>To further elucidate the mar regulon in the salmonellae , we examined the effect of bile on acrAB transcription and whether the presence of MarA was necessary for acrAB regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15073288" target="_blank">15073288</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although MarA can act as an activator or repressor depending on the orientation of the mar box and the gene it is regulating , the repression of acrR allows expression of acrAB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18407759" target="_blank">18407759</a>]<br></li>
<li>Failure of antibiotic therapy is also assured by the two-step regulon that activates PmrD , which in turn activates the global regulator of efÔ¨Çux pumps , the MarA operon , that eventually leads to the activation of acrB , the gene coding for the transporter component of the main efÔ¨Çux pump ( AcrAB ) of the organism [ 5 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21982147" target="_blank">21982147</a>]<br></li>
<li>Likewise , when MarA , another regulator of MDR efflux pumps was inactivated in SI1 and SI3 , the susceptibility of the mutants to the drugs tested did not dramatically change ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21858134" target="_blank">21858134</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the inactivation of RamA , MarR , MarA , SoxR , and SoxS did not affect the susceptibilities of the strain [ 17 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21858134" target="_blank">21858134</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is probably due to an increase of MarA for the case of the DsoxS/pBAD-soxS strain and SoxS for DmarA/pBAD-marA ( Fig. 3a , b ) , which further increases the repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752112" target="_blank">22752112</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA caused a change in the electrophoretic mobility at concentrations ranging from 100 to 200 nM , while SoxS required 400 nM of the puriÔ¨Åed protein to cause the same effect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752112" target="_blank">22752112</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , even at the lower concentrations of SoxS ( 0.0125 mM ) the high-molecular-mass complex was observed , while incubating with SoxS alone required 0.4 mM to produce a shift using the same DNA probe ( Fig. 3b , fragment C ) , suggesting that the affinity of SoxS for the promoter region of ompW increases in the presence of MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23393149" target="_blank">23393149</a>]<br></li>
<li>As observed for SoxS , lower levels of MarA were required to form the high-molecular-mass complex ( 100 nM ) than when the protein was incubated alone with the ompW promoter ( 200 nM ) , suggesting the same increased affinity for the promoter region as observed in the case of SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23393149" target="_blank">23393149</a>]<br></li>
<li>Salicylate up-regulates MarA in macrophages , but since AcrAB efÔ¨Çux pumps are already up-regulated , probably through SoxS or RamA , salicylate does not activate the efÔ¨Çux pumps signiÔ¨Åcantly enough to affect the tolerance to ciproÔ¨Çoxacin .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20237076" target="_blank">20237076</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , to examine whether the three paralog proteins share the ability to upregulate mgtA , we determined mgtA expression when SoxS , MarA , or Rob was overexpressed in the soxS , marA , or rob mutant background .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18487336" target="_blank">18487336</a>]<br></li>
<li>To verify the functionality of the three expressed proteins , we measured their abilities to promote acrAB expression , which is known to be stimulated by Rob , MarA , or SoxS ( 37 , 43 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18487336" target="_blank">18487336</a>]<br></li>
<li>Together , this regulation could be responsible for the increased resistance to NaOCl observed in the cells overexpressing MarA or SoxS ( Table 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752112" target="_blank">22752112</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to what has been described for SoxS or MarA , the intracellular levels of Rob do not appear to be subject to extensive variations under most of the conditions tested , although a moderate increase has been observed in stationary phase or in phosphate - or glucose-re-stricted medium ( 17 ) .

<li>The synthesis of MarA in E. coli was reported to be induced slightly by PQ ( 34 ) , an effect that could underlie SoxS-independent induction of sodA in both organisms .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10613858" target="_blank">10613858</a>]<br></li>
<li>Repression of ompF by MarA is thought to occur indirectly through its activation of micF , whose RNA product interacts with ompF mRNA to prevent translation ( 4 , 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11796342" target="_blank">11796342</a>]<br></li>
<li>This means that a strong induction of MarA ( and a sequential induction of acrAB ) is expected only when MarR is inactivated as , indeed , occurs with SAL which binds MarR and inactivates it ( 52 ) .

<li>Expression of acrAB-tolC is regulated by the global regulator , MarA , which is a positive regulator ( Alekshun and Levy , 1999 ) and by AcrR ( decreased expression in 2a ) , which is a repressor speciÔ¨Åc for the acrAB operon ( Ma et al. , 1996 ) .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11229910" target="_blank">11229910</a>]<br></li>

<li>The expression of MarA is further activated when MarA binds marbox in the operator of marRAB .7 MarA not only regulates its own expression , but also the expression of many genes involved in adaptation to stress conditions , such as oxidative stress , heavy metals or antimicrobials .10 A well-known example of an adaptive phenotype controlled by MarA is increased tolerance to antibiotics such as tetracycline , chloramphenicol and Ô¨Çuoroquinolones ,11,12 and to other anti-microbial compounds such as triclosan13 and pine oil .14 This is achieved mainly due to control of efÔ¨Çux by up-regulation of 15 the AcrAB-TolC efÔ¨Çux pump and control of inÔ¨Çux by the induction of micF ,13,16 which encodes an antisense RNA involved in the regulation of outer membrane protein F ( OmpF ) , through which hydrophilic substances enter the cell .

<li>To understand our results , it is worth mentioning that RamA-binding sites have already been reported in Salmonella concerning the acrAB and tolC promoters .32 The 20 bp sequences recognized by this regulator resemble those initially reported to be present in all members of the marA/soxS/rob regulon in E. coli .33 It has been described that most of the residues of the two helix-turn-helix motifs ( important for DNA sequence recognition ) of MarA from E. coli are conserved in RamA from S. enterica sero-var Paratyphi B. 34 Moreover , it has previously been reported that the marRAB promoter contains its own marbox sequence .33 In agreement with this , RamA from Salmonella Paratyphi B has been shown to bind the MarA operator of E. coli .34 Thus , the binding sites characterized for MarA and SoxS in E. coli , equally termed marbox or soxbox , are similar to the already-mentioned rambox in Salmonella .31,32 Therefore , increased levels of RamA ( .60 - fold ) and/or SoxS ( .4 - fold ) could bind to the rambox/marbox located in the marRAB promoter and activate marA transcription , hence explaining the increased levels of marA expression observed for strains 59-mut2 [ RamA overproducer ( .60 - fold ) ] , 59-64 [ SoxS overproducer ( .4 - fold ) ] and 60-mut2 [ RamA overproducer ( .60 - fold ) and SoxS overproducer ( .4 - fold ) ] .

<li>MarA regulates its own transcription as well as regulating the expression of the mar regulon , whereas MarR acts by repressing marRAB transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19104017" target="_blank">19104017</a>]<br></li>
<li>Together , these results demonstrate that overexpression of Rob , but not of SoxS or MarA , is able to speciÔ¨Åcally induce mgtA expression in a PhoP-independent fashion .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18487336" target="_blank">18487336</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here we demonstrate that Rob ( but not its paralog protein SoxS or MarA ) is able to induce mgtA transcription in a PhoP-independent fashion by binding to a conserved Mar/Sox/Rob motif localized downstream of the PhoP-box and overlapping the PhoP-dependent transcriptional start site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18487336" target="_blank">18487336</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this work , we show that the mgtA regulatory region also harbors a Mar/Sox/Rob box downstream the PhoP recognition motif and that its expression is selectively induced by Rob and not modulated by MarA or SoxS .

Collao ‚Ä¢ E. H. Morales ‚Ä¢ F. Gil ‚Ä¢ R. Polanco ‚Ä¢ I. L. CalderoÃÅn ‚Ä¢ C. P. Saavedra Received : 15 March 2012 / Revised : 1 June 2012 / Accepted : 8 June 2012 / Published online : 1 July 2012 Springer-Verlag 2012 Abstract To survive , Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) must sense signals found in phagocytic cells and modulate gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752112" target="_blank">22752112</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MarA protein positively regulates transcription of acrAB , and it was therefore unexpected that the latter genes were not up-regulated after exposure to TC .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29018419" target="_blank">29018419</a>]<br></li>
<li>rob is negatively regulated by MarA and SoxS The transcript levels of rob in the DmarA and DsoxS strains were repressed after treatment with NaOCl as in the wild type ( 0.32 ¬± 0.02 and 0.20 ¬± 0.02-fold change , respectively , Fig. 3a , b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752112" target="_blank">22752112</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that under the assayed conditions , ArcA is not active , since , as observed in the presence of NaOCl , when ArcA , MarA and SoxS are present , ompW is negatively regulated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23393149" target="_blank">23393149</a>]<br></li>
<li>To verify the functionality of the three expressed proteins , we measured their abilities to promote acrAB expression , which is known to be stimulated by Rob , MarA , or SoxS ( 37 , 43 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18487336" target="_blank">18487336</a>]<br></li>
<li>They concluded that acrR is a secondary modulator of acrRAB expression and suggested that up-regulation under general stress conditions is controlled by an unidentiÔ¨Åed regulator , possibly a homologue of the known global regulator MarA , SoxS , or Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11036033" target="_blank">11036033</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , the expression of acrAB is regulated by the global regulators , RamA , SoxS , MarA , and Rob ( Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ; Abouzeed et al. , 2008 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23503095" target="_blank">23503095</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of acrAB-tolC is regulated by the global regulator , MarA , which is a positive regulator ( Alekshun and Levy , 1999 ) and by AcrR ( decreased expression in 2a ) , which is a repressor speciÔ¨Åc for the acrAB operon ( Ma et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18407759" target="_blank">18407759</a>]<br></li>
<li>At a local level acrAB expression is modulated by the local repressor AcrR , and at a global level it is modulated by MarA , SoxS , and Rob , which belong to the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators ( 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19104017" target="_blank">19104017</a>]<br></li>
<li>In E. coli it is modulated at the lowest level by the local repressor AcrR .14 At a more global level , acrAB expression is modulated by stress conditions and by global regulatory genes , such as marA , soxS , and rob .14,17,18 The acrAB locus is indeed part of the mar , sox , and rob regulons of E. coli , the activation of which confers a low-level resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents and organic solvents .17 Previous studies clearly showed that overexpression of marA , which results from marR mutations , would down-regulate the expression of acrR , thus inducing high-level AcrAB expression and antimicrobial resistance .23 Proteins encoded by the mar locus include the transcriptional activator , MarA , its local repressor , MarR , and MarB and MarC , two proteins with unknown functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16201927" target="_blank">16201927</a>]<br></li>
<li>In E. coli , the transcription of acrAB and micF is controlled by the homologous proteins MarA , SoxS and Rob ( 9 , 10 ) , but may be affected by other proteins such as AcrR ( 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19120970" target="_blank">19120970</a>]<br></li>
<li>RamA is homologous to MarA and SoxS .13 Bacteria overexpressing ramA may exhibit the MDR phenotype by 9 inducing expression of acrAB and tolC .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23453941" target="_blank">23453941</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , micF and acrAB are also induced by stress signals in additional ways that are not dependent on the marRAB system .17 Interestingly , antibiotics that serve as substrates of the AcrAB efÔ¨Çux pump are very weak inducers of the marRAB operon in E. coli and do not induce these genes in Salmonella .6,8 Based on that , it was suggested that exposure of E. coli or S. enterica to salicylate activates MarA through binding to its repressor , MarR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20237076" target="_blank">20237076</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is interesting to note that at least 10 of the differentially expressed genes in this study were regulated by MarA and SoxS in E. coli as well [ 22,38,39 ] ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21811569" target="_blank">21811569</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA , SoxS and Rob bind to a 20-bp asymmetric degenerate sequence ( marbox ) ( 2 ) , and regulate the expression of a large set of genes known as the mar/sox/rob regulons .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19120970" target="_blank">19120970</a>]<br></li>
<li>Homologues of MarA , such as SoxS , Rob , and RamA , have been shown to bind to the mar box and also to upregulate expression of the mar locus ( 3,8,11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15155237" target="_blank">15155237</a>]<br></li>
<li>AcrR is the local repressor encoded upstream of the acrAB genes and mutations within its coding sequence have been associated with increased expression of the pump .14 In addition , three homologous transcriptional activators , RamA , SoxS and MarA , have been associated with increased acrB and tolC expression levels .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26679248" target="_blank">26679248</a>]<br></li>
<li>In both E. coli and S. enterica the global regu-2 -- 4 lators MarA and SoxS regulate the acrAB operon by binding to mar/sox boxes found downstream of the local repressor acrR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16492722" target="_blank">16492722</a>]<br></li>
<li>In E. coli , the acrRAB locus is a member of the mar and sox regulons , and both MarA and SoxS can activate acrAB expression ( 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15047514" target="_blank">15047514</a>]<br></li>
<li>When marA and soxS levels were analyzed in the different genetic backgrounds , we observed the same response to NaOCl found in the wild-type strain , therefore indicating that their expression is independent of MarA , SoxS , or Rob , which suggests a role for other factors such as SoxR for SoxS ( Fig. 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752112" target="_blank">22752112</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA is induced following salicylate treatment ,5 SoxS in response to superoxide and Rob following treatment with bile-salts and dipyridyl .6 -- 8 Up-regulation of these transcription factors has been shown to increase the expression of several genes , including acrAB and tolC .5,9,10 Although MarA , SoxS and Rob are present in Salmonella , studies have shown that the transcriptional activator RamA , which is not present in E. coli , plays the dominant role in the regulation of AcrAB -- TolC in Salmonella and other Enterobacter-iaceae .11 -- 17 To date , few inducers of RamA have been reported ; however , Nikaido et al. 18,19 demonstrated increased expression of ramA in response to the bacterial metabolite indole , and that acrAB induction by indole is dependent on RamA .

<li>Taken together , our results indicate that the expression of rob is repressed by the transcription factors MarA and SoxS in response to NaOCl due to a direct interaction with the promoter region .

<li>Thus , MarA ( an activator of marRAB ) and MarR ( a repressor of marRAB ) are controlled by the same promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19120970" target="_blank">19120970</a>]<br></li>
<li>Intracellular levels of MarA are controlled by MarR that binds to marO and negatively modulates expression of the marRAB operon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16842216" target="_blank">16842216</a>]<br></li>
<li>There is no clear pattern of the hierarchy of regulation of acrAB , although the transcriptional regulators MarA and SoxS can affect expression of these genes ( 36 , 41 , 49 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19411325" target="_blank">19411325</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although MarA can act as an activator or repressor depending on the orientation of the mar box and the gene it is regulating , the repression of acrR allows expression of acrAB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18407759" target="_blank">18407759</a>]<br></li>
<li>Failure of antibiotic therapy is also assured by the two-step regulon that activates PmrD , which in turn activates the global regulator of efÔ¨Çux pumps , the MarA operon , that eventually leads to the activation of acrB , the gene coding for the transporter component of the main efÔ¨Çux pump ( AcrAB ) of the organism [ 5 ] .

<li>The expression of MarA is further activated when MarA binds marbox in the operator of marRAB .7 MarA not only regulates its own expression , but also the expression of many genes involved in adaptation to stress conditions , such as oxidative stress , heavy metals or antimicrobials .10 A well-known example of an adaptive phenotype controlled by MarA is increased tolerance to antibiotics such as tetracycline , chloramphenicol and Ô¨Çuoroquinolones ,11,12 and to other anti-microbial compounds such as triclosan13 and pine oil .14 This is achieved mainly due to control of efÔ¨Çux by up-regulation of 15 the AcrAB-TolC efÔ¨Çux pump and control of inÔ¨Çux by the induction of micF ,13,16 which encodes an antisense RNA involved in the regulation of outer membrane protein F ( OmpF ) , through which hydrophilic substances enter the cell .

<li>For instance , in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli it modulates the transcription of dozens of genes .3,4 Salicylate is also associated with the production of factors involved with bacterial virulence5 and with reduction in the resistance to a variety of antimicrobials .2,3,6 In E. coli and Salmonella enterica , the global regulators MarA and MarR are induced by salicylate .7 MarR binds the mar operator that Ô¨Çanks the promoter of marRAB and represses the transcription of these genes .
