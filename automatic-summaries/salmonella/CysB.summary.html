				<div class="ACT"><br><ul><li>In our data set , CysB displayed signiÔ¨Åcant upregulation during acid adaptation and challenge .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26386064" target="_blank">26386064</a>]<br></li>
<li>All other cys operons had very low activity on swim plates and were induced in swarm conditions , consistent with CysB activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18957594" target="_blank">18957594</a>]<br></li>
<li>Proteins lacking 16 or 22 residues in CysB and OxyR , respectively , were mainly affected in repression but were constitutively active .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24659766" target="_blank">24659766</a>]<br></li>
<li>Ser54 corresponds to Ser35 in AmpR , Ser33 in OxyR , and Ser38 in CysB and GcvA , and these residues are required for DNA binding but not oligomerization ( 27 , 43 -- 45 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24659766" target="_blank">24659766</a>]<br></li>
<li>A different effect was observed for mutants with a A233V point mutation in OxyR and a A227D point mutation in CysB , which still repressed and activated transcription constitutively and bound DNA as dimers ( 9 , 31 , 43 -- 45 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24659766" target="_blank">24659766</a>]<br></li>
<li>The active form of most characterized LTTRs ( NahR , CysB , OxyR , CbnR , DntR , ArgP , TsaR , and AphB ) is a tetramer ( 28 , 30 -- 35 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24659766" target="_blank">24659766</a>]<br></li>
<li>The resultant one-protein complexes contain CysB bound at either CBS-KI or CBS-P1 and can activate transcription initiation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>Steric hindrance would probably prevent binding of second CysB to a complex already containing a CysB bound to both sites , and if such a complex were formed , we would expect its electrophoretic mobility to increase with N-acetyl-L-serine , which it does not .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activation sites , as well as CBS-J2 and CBS-P2 , are recognized by two CysB subunits related by dyad symmetry , and N-acetyl-L-serine alters CysB to increase binding afÔ¨Ånity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>In our model , N-acetyl-L-serine decreases bending by causing CysB to-bind only to a single site , either CBS-K1 or CBS-P1 , and these species activate transcription initiation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>We can not yet say whether this complex contains one or two CysB protein molecules , but in either case binding to CBS-P3 inhibits binding to the overlapping CBS-P1 and CBS-P2 sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Acetyl-L-serine stimulates binding of CysB protein to CBS-P2 but inhibits binding to CBS-K2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this case , however , acetyl-L-serine inhibits binding to CBS-K2 , making it likely that the fast complex contains only a single CysB protein molecule bound to CBS-K1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>At relatively low CysB protein concentrations , O-acetyl-L-serine would cause a single CysB protein molecule to-bind tightly to CBS-P1 , rather than to CBS-P3 , thereby decreasing DNA bending and increasing complex electrophoretic mobility .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Acetyl-L-serine stimulates binding to the sites required for positive regulation , i.e. , CBS-K1 and CBS-P1 , and also decreases or eliminates DNA bending , giving rise to fast complexes , which also contain only a single CysB protein molecule .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>striking differences between these sites is that acetyl-L-serine stimulates CysB protein binding to CBS-J and CBS-K1 and , as demonstrated in this report , inhibits CysB protein binding to CBS-B .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1706701" target="_blank">1706701</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , our results suggests that CysB regulates expression of cysJIH operon to produce H2S , which could acts as a cellular protector during oxidative-stress in S. Typhimurium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25637663" target="_blank">25637663</a>]<br></li>
<li>Microarray analysis of E. coli during sulfur starvation found increased expression of ahpCF encoding an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase positively regulated by OxyR , and the CysB regulon has been shown by microarray analysis to be expressed in cells stressed by methyl viologen ( Blanchard et al. , 2007 ; Gyaneshwar et al. , 2005 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20600858" target="_blank">20600858</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of genes involved in cysteine biosynthesis is controlled by the LysR-type transcriptional-regulator CysB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18957594" target="_blank">18957594</a>]<br></li>
<li>In Escherichia coli , sbp is positively regulated by Cbl , a transcriptional-regulator with 60 % amino acid similarity to CysB , involved in the regulation of cysteine biosynthesis from organic sulfur sources ( Kredich , 1996 ; Stec et al. , 2006 ; Van Der Ploeg et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18957594" target="_blank">18957594</a>]<br></li>
<li>Arginine decarboxylase expression is increased by CysB binding its promoter , and cysB mutants do not ferment many carbohydrates as well as the parent strains of E. coli and S. typhimurium ( Quan et al. , 2002 ; Shi & Bennett , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18957594" target="_blank">18957594</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this way , CysB protein could provide dual control of cysK by activating the major promoter through an interaction at CBS-K1 when sulfur is limiting and by repressing the minor promoter by steric effects at CBS-K1 and CBS-K2 when sulfur is replete .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>and the catabolite repressor -RCB- activator ( Cra ) protein ( Saier & Ramseier , 1996 ; Saier et al. , 1996 ) , nitrogen utilization is controlled by the NtrBC sensor kinase -RCB- response-regulator pair in conjunction with the GlnB and GlnD proteins ( Magasanik , 1996 ; Reitzer , 1996a , b ) , phosphorus utilization is controlled by the PhoR -RCB- PhoB sensor kinase -RCB- response-regulator pair ( Wanner , 1996 ) , iron utilization is regulated by the Fur transcription factor ( Earhart , 1996 ; Gralla & Collado-Vides , 1996 ) and sulfur metabolism is controlled by the CysB transcriptional-activator ( Kredich , 1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11782505" target="_blank">11782505</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MgCl2 concentration was 10 mM ; DNA concentrations were approximately 2 3 105 dpm of 32P per 20-ml reaction mixture ( 0.25 to 0.5 mg/ml ) ; CysB and N-acetyl-L-serine were varied as indicated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>Identical results were obtained when O-acetyl-L-serine was added either together with CysB protein or after a 2-min preincubation of DNA and CysB protein , and N-acetyl-L-serine was as effective as O-acetyl-L-serine ( not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>With 2 , ug of CysB protein per ml , runoff product formation was markedly stimulated with as little as 0.1 mM N-acetyl-L-serine and was half-maximal with N-acetyl-L-serine concentrations between 0.2 and 0.4 mM ( Fig. 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>With 3 jig of CysB protein per ml and 1 mM N-acetyl-L-serine , complex formation was virtually complete , but appreciable increases in free TABLE 1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2105304" target="_blank">2105304</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test this possibility , we investigated the effects of high CysB protein concentrations in a runoff assay and found that with 3 mM N-acetyl-L-serine transcription initiation was maximally stimulated by CysB protein at 3 , ug/ml but was inhibited by approximately 60 and 90 % with CysB protein at 20 and 40 , u.g / ml , respectively ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Concentrations of CysB protein and O-acetyl-L-serine are indicated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>At a fixed CysB protein concentration of 1 , ug/ml , stimulation of binding was noted with as little as 0.1 mM N-acetyl-L-serine and reached a halfmaximal value at 0.3 to 1 mM ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2105304" target="_blank">2105304</a>]<br></li>
<li>At 1 mM N-acetyl-L-serine and 5 , ug of CysB protein per ml , the inhibitory effects of 4 mM sulfide could be partially overcome by increasing CysB protein to 10 , ug/ml and were completely reversed at 40 , ug/ml ( Fig. 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2105304" target="_blank">2105304</a>]<br></li>
<li>At 10 jig of CysB protein per ml , inhibition by approximately 90 % required sulfide concentrations of 0.5 , 1 , and 2 mM at N-acetyl-L-serine concentrations of 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.3 mM , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2105304" target="_blank">2105304</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here , our results demonstrated that UhpA could perform the similar functions at up-shift high osmotic treatment for 30 min as CysB and Cb1 did in presence of acetylserine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19727945" target="_blank">19727945</a>]<br></li>
<li>CysB positively regulates the genes in sulfur assimilation and cysteine biosynthesis when bound with NAS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18957594" target="_blank">18957594</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test whether environmental sulfur availability affected induction of the CysB regulon in swarm cells , cysJ expression was used to represent CysB regulon activity , as the cells were grown in NBG swarm and swim media with sulfur sources added .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18957594" target="_blank">18957594</a>]<br></li>
<li>The CysB regulon was induced when cells were grown in the presence of the oxidant methyl viologen and the most stressed auxotrophs had increased OxyR and SoxR activity in low-level oxidative-stress conditions compared to wild-type .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20600858" target="_blank">20600858</a>]<br></li>
<li>cysJ and cysH genes were overexpressed in presence of CEF and cysH in presence of MEN in sulfate media and depend on CysB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25637663" target="_blank">25637663</a>]<br></li>
<li>As we previously , reported cysE expression is highly induced in swarm cells ( Turnbull and Surette , 2008 ) independently of CysB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20600858" target="_blank">20600858</a>]<br></li>

<li>However , the physiologic signiÔ¨Åcance of such repression is questionable , because the CysB concentrations required for transcription inhibition are 40 - to 100-fold higher than those required for activation .

<li>SulÔ¨Åde and thiosulfate are antiinducers , probably exerting their effects by competing with N-acetyl - - serine for binding to the CysB activator ( Hryniewicz & Kredich , 1991 ; Ostrowski & Kredich , 1990 ) .

<li>Sulfide and thiosulfate are potent anti-inducers of the CysB regulon , by antagonizing binding of NAS to CysB ( Hryniewicz & Kredich , 1991 ; Ostrowski & Kredich , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18957594" target="_blank">18957594</a>]<br></li>
<li>We reasoned that if cysE upregulation is driving induction of the CysB regulon by increasing NAS levels , adding NAS to swim cells should be able to induce the anti-biotic resistance phenotype in non-swarming cells .

<li>While CysE activity would be normally inhibited by cysteine , elevated expression may overcome this inhibition leading to increased production of the OAS , the precursor for cysteine biosynthesis , and NAS which activates CysB .

<li>CysB protein inhibited transcription initiation at the cysB promoter in an in vitro runoff assay , indicating that cysB is negatively autoregulated by the binding of CysB protein to the cysB promoter , where it acts as a repressor .

<li>Although easily demonstrated , inhibition of CysB protein binding by sodium sulfide in the gel shift assay was only modest .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2105304" target="_blank">2105304</a>]<br></li>
<li>In gel mobility shift assays , the mobility of CysB protein-cysP promoter complexes was increased by O-acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>N-Acetyl-L-serine could inhibit two-protein complex formation by decreasing the affinity of CysB for CBS-K2 , or it might favor such a complex by causing the first CysB to-bind to CBS-K1 alone , thereby freeing CBS-K2 for further occupancy .

<li>These data indicate the presence of two CysB protein-binding sites in the cysK promoter region : one , designated CBS-K1 , at approximately positions -78 to -39 , where binding is stimulated by acetyl-L-serine , and the other , designated CBS-K2 , between positions -115 and -79 , where binding is inhibited by acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>The binding region between positions -76 and -35 was designated CBS-J and is analogous to CBS-K1 in position and by the fact that its binding to CysB protein is stimulated , rather than inhibited , by acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>With higher CysB concentrations and N-acetyl-L-serine , a second tetramer can bind to either CBS-K2 or CBS-P2 , giving two-protein complexes in which the shape of the DNA ( shown as slightly bent ) is not known .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>With the higher CysB concentrations required for DNase I protection experiments , a second CysB protein molecule can bind specifically to CBS-P2 , resulting in a two-protein complex , but this does not occur with the cysK promoter , in which binding to CBS-K2 is inhibited by acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Acetyl-L-serine changes the conformation of CysB protein in such a way that it binds preferentially to CBS-P1 rather tha to CBS-P3 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our footprinting data indicate that CysB binds to CBS-K2a and CBS-K2c in the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine and to CBS-K2a and CBS-K2b in its presence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>With the cysP promoter , our footprinting and stoichiometric binding data indicate that in the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine , a single CysB tetramer binds to three halfsites , CBS-P1a , CBS-P1b , and CBS-P3b ( Fig. 8 and 9C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>Inhibition of binding to CBS-K2 by acetyl-L-serine would diminish or completely eliminate DNA bending and result in formation of the fast complex , in which CysB protein is bound only to CBS-K1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our data indicate that the slow complex represents binding of CysB protein to both CBS-K1 and CBS-K2 and that the fast complex found in the presence of acetyl-L-serine is due to-binding to CBS-K1 alone .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since N-acetyl-L-serine inhibits binding to CBS-P3 and stimulates binding to CBS-P1 and CBS-P2 , the two-protein complex noted in the presence of CysB this effector probably contains a separate tetramer at each of the last two sites ( Fig. 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>We propose that binding of CysB protein to the CBS-P3 site in the absence of acetyl-L-serine causes the DNA to bend at a point approximately midway between CBS-P1 and CBS-P2 , resulting in anomalously slow electrophoretic mobility and DNase I hypersensitivity at positions -30 to -27 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Protection between 2115 and 2136 was very faint at CysB concentrations of lower than 10 to 30 mg/ml , at which most complexes have been shown to contain a single CysB tetramer , which is bound to CBS-K1 in the presence of N-acetyl-L-serine and to both CBS-K1 and the downstream portion of CBS-K2 in its absence ( 18 , 31 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , CysB appears to-bind to CBS-Ba and CBS-Bb both in the absence and in the presence of N-acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the higher affinities of CysB for the cysK and cysP promoters may be related more to the presence of secondary binding sites than to differences in affinities between the transcription activator sites CBS-P1 , CBS-K1 , and CBS-J .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine , a single CysB tetramer binds to both the CBS-K1 and CBS-K2 sites of the cysK promoter or to CBS-P3 in the cysP promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the case of the cysP promoter , one-protein complexes in the presence of N-acetyl-L-serine are most likely to contain CysB at CBS-P1 , which has a sixfold-greater binding affinity than CBS-P2 ( 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although CysB protein binds to CBS-K1 and CBS-J in the absence of inducer , in vitro transcription from the cysJIH promoter has been shown to require the additional presence of either O-acetyl-L-serine or N-acetyl-L-serine , even at CysB protein concentrations that ensure total occupancy of CBS-J ( 25 , 26 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>This correlation holds true for the CBS-P2 sequence , which is similar to that of CBS-P1 and also binds CysB protein more tightly in the presence of acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>DNase I footprints indicate that these species contain CysB bound to either CBS-K1 alone or CBS-P1 alone in the presence of N-acetyl-L-serine ( 24 , 39 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>From gel mobility shift studies , we estimate that the CysB protein concentrations necessary for half-maximal binding in the presence of O-acetyl-L-serine are approximately 0.6 , 0.1 , and 0.1 , ug/ml , respectively , for fragments containing either CBS-P2 alone , CBS-P1 alone , or both sites together .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since accessory sites appear to increase binding afÔ¨Ånity in the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine ( 17 , 18 ) , we speculate that their physiologic function is to sequester CysB at cys promoters when sulfur is replete in order to ensure a rapid response to sulfur limitation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conclude , therefore , that binding alone is insufficient to stimulate transcription and that the three - to eightfold increase in binding caused by inducer at lower CysB protein concentrations is a consequence of qualitative changes leading to formation of a transcription initiation complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2105304" target="_blank">2105304</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , CysB appears to recognize speciÔ¨Åc determinants on either side of position 250 and is sufÔ¨Åciently Ô¨Çexible to contact them and activate promoters in which the distances between these determinants vary by 1 bp .

<li>cysJIH expression is upregulated by CysB in response to ceftriaxone or menadione In order to correlate a possible regulation of cysJIH by CysB in ROS treatment , we evaluated the transcript levels of cysJ , cysI and cysH genes in wild type and DcysB strains in sulfate medium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25637663" target="_blank">25637663</a>]<br></li>
<li>The requirement for sulfur limitation appears to be due to an anti-inducer effect of sulfide , which interferes with the ability of CysB protein and inducer to activate gene expression both in vivo and in vitro ( 14 , 15 , 26 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>These effects are in contrast to those observed in studies of positively regulated cys promoters , in which N-acetyl-L-serine stimulates binding and causes CysB protein to activate transcription initiation .

<li>The effects of N-acetyl-L-serine and sulfide on binding of CysB protein appeared to be competitive with each other , since inhibition by 1 to 4 mM sodium sulfide could be overcome by increasing N-acetyl-L-serine from 1 mM to 10 mM ( data not shown ) .

<li>In vitro binding of CysB protein to the cysK promoter induces DNA bending , which is diminished or eliminated by acetyl-L-serine ( 34 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vitro transcription initiation from the cysP promoter was shown to require both CysB protein and either O-acetyl-L-serine or N-acetyl-L-serine , which act as inducers , and was inhibited by the anti-inducer sulfide .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>DISCUSSION The studies reported here demonstrate that CysB protein binds to the cysJIH promoter region in vitro and that such binding is stimulated by the inducers N-acetyl-L-serine and O-acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2105304" target="_blank">2105304</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vitro studies have demonstrated that CysB protein binds to a site immediately preceding the -35 regions of the positively regulated cysJIH and cysK promoters and that binding is stimulated by acetyl-L-serine , i.e. , O-acetyl-L-serine or N-acetyl-L-serine ( 34 , 40 ) .

<li>In contrast to results obtained with the cysJIH and cysK promoters , which showed that specific binding of CysB protein was stimulated by the inducer N-acetyl-L-serine or O-acetyl-L-serine ( 27 , 30 ) , binding to the cysB promoter region was inhibited by N-acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1706701" target="_blank">1706701</a>]<br></li>
<li>The combination of CysB protein and acetyl-L-serine markedly stimulates in vitro transcription initiation from both promoters , and this effect is inhibited by the anti-inducer sulfide ( 32 , 39 , 40 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>The reversal of sulfide inhibition by CysB protein or N-acetyl-L-serine indicates that such inhibition is specific for transcription initiated from the cysJIH promoter and is not due to nonspecific effects of sulfide on transcription in general .

<li>The ability of sulfide to inhibit binding of CysB protein to the cysJIH promoter parallels its effects on transcription initiation and is competitive with N-acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2105304" target="_blank">2105304</a>]<br></li>

<li>Furthermore , the effects of loss of CysB were much less pronounced under conditions of catabolite repression than in the absence of a catabolite-repressing carbon source , and cAMP largely reversed the effect of the loss of CysB .

<li>DNA bending may be a mechanism for sequestering CysB at certain promoter sites by increasing their affinity for this protein in the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>A third possibility is that CysB does not bend DNA at all and that changes in electrophoretic mobility simply reflect binding by different amounts of protein , e.g. , a slowly migrating two-protein complex in the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine and a more rapidly migrating one-protein complex in its presence .

<li>CysB positively regulates at least six different promoters within the cysteine regulon by activating transcription initiation in the presence of the inducer N-acetyl-L-serine ( 32 ) and negatively autoregulates its own expression from cysB ( 3 , 23 , 34 ) .

<li>CTS-1 , a part of the CysB regulon , accounts for the majority of cysteine uptake , and is repressed by growth on cysteine and other reduced sulfur sources .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18957594" target="_blank">18957594</a>]<br></li>

<li>With our 19-bp half-site model , binding of a CysB tetramer to an activation site would leave two subunits potentially free for interactions with other half-sites , and we believe that one of these is so employed during bending of the cysK and cysP promoters in the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine , in which binding occurs to both an activation site and part of an adjacent accessory site ( see below ) .

<li>These results suggest that CysB binds to the K2a and K2c half-sites in the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine and to the K2a and K2b half-sites in its presence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of CysB protein and N-acetyl-L-serine , RNA runoff products of 153 , 151 , and 147 nucleotides were formed , corresponding to in vitro transcription start sites at -2 , +1 , and +5 , respectively , relative to the major in vivo start site ( Fig. 3 ) .

<li>Thus , increased binding in the presence of acetyl-L-serine does not cause formation of a transcription initiation complex and must be a consequence of changes in CysB protein that lead to such an event ( 26 ) .

<li>Although binding is complete at 10 , ug of CysB protein per ml even in the absence of acetyl-L-serine , in vitro transcription initiation under such conditions requires the further addition of inducer ( 30 ) .

<li>Binding of the CysB protein to CBS-B inhibits in vitro transcription initiation ( 41 ) and is probably responsible for negative autoregulation of cysB ( 5 , 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>DISCUSSION The in vitro studies reported here indicate that negative autoregulation of cysB , originally proposed on the basis of in vivo properties of cysB-lac fusion strains ( 4 , 14 ) , is due to the ability of CysB protein to-bind to the cysB promoter and inhibit transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1706701" target="_blank">1706701</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ability of N-acetyl-L-serine to inhibit the binding of CysB protein to the cysB promoter and to reverse inhibition of in vitro transcription initiation suggests that this phenom-enon might have relevance in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1706701" target="_blank">1706701</a>]<br></li>
<li>In presence of high concentrations of CysB , due to an increase in cysteine , CysB might be able to-bind to the CBS-J2 site , repressing the expression of the operon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25637663" target="_blank">25637663</a>]<br></li>
<li>CysB binds to specific sites just upstream of the -35 regions of the cysJIH , cysK , and cysP promoters , where , in the presence of N-acetyl-L-serine , it stimulates transcription initiation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>Purified CysB protein has been shown in vitro to-bind to sequences immediately upstream of the -35 regions of the S. typhimurium cysJIH and cysK promoters and to activate transcription from these promoters in the presence of acetyl-L-serine ( 27 , 29 , 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1706701" target="_blank">1706701</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ability of N-acetyl-L-serine to increase the electro-phoretic mobility of the two-protein complex of the cysP promoter suggests that , in the absence of this effector , it contains CysB at CBS-P3 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>CBS-B differs from the three sites associated with positive regulation with respect to the effects of acetyl-L-serine , which inhibits binding of CysB protein and also partially reverses the inhibition of in vitro transcription initiation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>N-Acetyl-L-serine , an inducer of the cysteine regulon , inhibited the binding of CysB protein to the cysB promoter and partially reversed the ability of CysB protein to inhibit transcription initiation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1706701" target="_blank">1706701</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similar analysis demonstrated that disruption of the four-cysteine zinc Ô¨Ånger motif of DksA by cysteine to serine point mutagenesis ( C114S ) signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced the activation of PcysD transcription in response to RNS ( Figure 5B ) and that CysB , a LysR-type transcriptional-regulator fundamental to the control of sulfur utilization and cysteine biosynthetic operons ( Schell , 1993 ) , is required for ‚Ä¢ NO - and DksA-dependent activation of PcysD in Salmonella exposed to RNS ( Figure 5C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27065993" target="_blank">27065993</a>]<br></li>
<li>Evidence is also presented that indicates that binding of CysB protein to the cysK promoter induces DNA bending in the absence of inducer but little or no bending in the presence of inducer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data indicate that the increased electrophoretic mobility of the C-1 complex in the presence of N-acetyl-L-serine is not caused by binding of fewer CysB monomers and is consistent with a model in which this phenomenon is due to changes in DNA bending .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , several genetic factors regulate the expression of cysK in addition to CysB , such as OmpR and CysE .54 CysK is produced at high levels and is thought to be the primary enzyme responsible for cysteine synthesis ; however , CysM is the predominant enzyme catalysing the reaction in anaerobic conditions and when thiosulphate is present to react with O-acetyl - - serine ( OAS ) .48 L CysB binds the inducer N-acetyl-L-serine ( NAS ) , the product of a non-enzymatic rearrangement of OAS and inducer of the cysteine regulon , which activates genes involved in sulphate assimilation , promoting more H2S synthesis .55 Moreover , serine transacetylase ( CysE ) is feedback inhibited by cysteine , providing kinetic control of the production of cysteine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27530757" target="_blank">27530757</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here , CysB binds to all three half-sites , bending the DNA , and N-acetyl-L-serine decreases the extent of bending .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>This arrangement allows a single CysB tetramer to-bind t all three half-sites on the same helical face , but only in the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>We currently favor the notion that the 1000 bending of the cysK and cysP promoters functions to increase contacts between CysB and promoters , with a resultant increase in binding affinity that helps to sequester CysB at its promoters , particularly when sulfur is replete and N-acetyl-L-serine levels are low .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>To formulate a model that is applicable to both the cysK and cysP promoters , we propose that the slow complex noted in the gel mobility shift experiments with relatively low CysB protein concentrations in the absence of acetyl-L-serine contains a single CysB protein molecule bound to both sites , which induces DNA bending .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>With the CysB protein concentration of 0.2 , ug/ml used to titrate the effects of O-acetyl-L-serine on the mobility of complexes containing both sites ( Fig. 7 ) , independent binding to CBS-P2 would have been insufficient to form a two-protein complex unless the affinity for this site were markedly increased through a cooperative interaction with another CysB protein molecule bound to CBS-P1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , CysB appears to-bind to the cysP promoter as a tetramer , and N-acetyl-L-serine increases the mobility of the C-1 complex without changing its stoichiometry .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>This may be related to the fact that acetyl-L-serine inhibits binding of CysB protein to the former and stimulates binding to the latter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>The marked dissimilarities of these half-site arrangements and of their responses to N-acetyl-L-serine suggest that CysB , a homotetramer , binds to them with different combinations of subunits .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mixtures of DNA and various amounts of CysB protein were incubated in the presence or absence of either 1 mM N-acetyl-L-serine or 1 mM 0-acetyl-L-serine and analyzed for DNA-protein complexes by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels .

<li>Radiolabeled DNA ( 0.5 , ug/ml ) was preincubated with various amounts of purified CysB protein for 5 min at 37 ¬∞ C in either the presence or absence of 1 mM N-acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2105304" target="_blank">2105304</a>]<br></li>
<li>At the saturating concentration of 5 mM N-acetyl-L-serine , large amounts of runoff products were noted with 0.5 , ug of CysB protein per ml .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>CysB protein bound to this fragment with a half-maximal effect noted at slightly less than 3 , ug of CysB per ml in the absence of O-acetyl-L-serine ( Fig. 8B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>At 0.5 jig of CysB protein per ml , the addition of O-acetyl-L-serine stimulated complex formation and also increased the electrophoretic mobility of complexed DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of 1.0 mM N-acetyl-L-serine , DNA-protein complexes were detected with as little as 0.1 , ug of CysB protein per ml and comprised all of the DNA at 2 p.g / ml ( Fig. 2 , lanes 2 to 7 ) .

<li>DNA-protein complexes were also formed in the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine but accounted for less than half of the total DNA at 2 , ug of CysB protein per ml ( Fig. 2 , lanes 8 to 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2105304" target="_blank">2105304</a>]<br></li>
<li>A CysB protein concentration of 10 , ug/ml was required to-bind all of the DNA in the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine ( not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2105304" target="_blank">2105304</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to requiring CysB protein , derepression of this biosynthetic pathway requires sulfur limitation and the L-cysteine precursor O-acetyl-L-serine , which acts as an inducer ( 14 , 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcriptional activation of these genes requires CysB , the inducer N-acetyl - - serine and conditions of sulfur limitation ( Kredich , 1992 , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11782505" target="_blank">11782505</a>]<br></li>
<li>The competitive interactions of acetyl-L-serine and sulfide with CysB protein are of unknown physiologic significance , since accumulation of the inducer O-acetyl-L-serine should be prevented through its reaction with sulfide in the 0-acetylserine ( thiol ) - lyase reaction to form L-cysteine and by feedback inhibition of serine transacetylase by L-cysteine ( 20 , 22 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2105304" target="_blank">2105304</a>]<br></li>
<li>Gene activation in the cysteine regulon requires a combination of CysB protein , either O-acetyl-L-serine or its derivative N-acetyl-L-serine ( both of which serve as inducers ) , and sulfur limitation ( 15-17 , 29 ) .

<li>Our stoichiometric measurements allow us now to conclude that binding of a single CysB tetramer activates transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>The same reasoning can be applied to the cysK and cysP promoters , whose transcription activation is also maximal at CysB concentrations that give only one-protein complexes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>

<li>CysB is a tetrameric LysR-type regulator with an N-terminal DNA-binding domain , a central inducer-binding domain and a C-terminal oligomerization domain that is essential for stability ( Lochowska et al. , 2001 ) .

<li>Furthermore , if CysB binding to CBS-P1 results in an a subunit contact point that is different from those used for other cys promoters , it might also be possible to isolate a cysB mutant speciÔ¨Åcally defective in cysP promoter activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>CysB belongs to the LysR-family , a large group of one-component prokaryotic transcriptional activators which bind to promoter -35 regions , presumably through a predicted helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif ( 23 , 52 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>Highly purified CysB protein is a tetramer of identical 36-kilodalton subunits ( 25 , 29 ) with a deduced amino acid sequence that predicts a helix-turn-helix structure similar to that found in a number of other DNA-binding , regulatory proteins ( 3 , 31 ) .

<li>By analogy with certain other DNA-binding proteins , the binding domain of CysB protein is postulated to reside in a helix-turn-helix motif predicted to occur in amino acid residues 18 to 38 ( 7 ) .

<li>This interaction bends the cysP promoter somewhere within the 12 bp that separate CBS-P1b and CBS-P3b and presumably employs three CysB subunits .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since N-acetyl-L-serine inhibits binding to CBS-P3 and stimulates binding to CBS-P1 and CBS-P2 , the two-protein complex noted in the presence of CysB this effector probably contains a separate tetramer at each of the last two sites ( Fig. 4 ) .

<li>The hydroxyl radical footprints of CBS-J1 , CBS-K1 , and CBS-P1 each spanned a distance of about 40 bp and consisted of alternating regions of protected and unprotected DNA with an average periodicity of about 10 bp , indicating that CysB binds to one face of the DNA helix as depicted in an open cylinder projection in Fig. 3 , where adjacent sites have been omitted for clarity .

<li>For the purpose of further analyses , we will assume that a CysB activation site consists of two 19-bp half-sites , inverted with respect to each other and separated by 2 bp in CBS-K1 and by 1 bp in CBS-J1 and CBS-P1 .

<li>A similar phenomenon occurs in the cysK promoter , in which a single CysB tetramer binds to CBS-K2c , CBS-K1a , and CBS-K1b in the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine ( Fig. 9C ) and bends the DNA between CBS-K2c and CBS-K1a , which are separated by 13 bp ( 17 , 31 ) .

<li>All reactions contained RNA polymerase ( 75 ug/rml ) , CysB protein ( 10 , ug/ml ) , and a 509-bp KpnI-EcoRI fragment containing the cysJIH promoter and downstream sequences to +290 relative to the transcription start site ( 0.8 p.g / ml ) .

<li>Therefore , we attribute the smaller footprint extending to position 2115 to binding by a single CysB tetramer and the larger footprint extending to position 2136 to binding by two tetramers , one at CBS-K1 and the other at CBS-K2 .

<li>For instance , binding sites are currently defined only on the basis of their DNase I footprints , but stoichiometric measurements would allow us to determine whether they are composed of smaller domains , each with the capacity to recognize a separate 36-kDa subunit of the CysB tetramer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>Binding to this large a region by a single CysB protein is much easier to envision with bent DNA , since the diameter of a 144-kDa tetramer , if perfectly spherical , is 7 nm , which is equivalent to the length of only 21 bp of B-form DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>This correlation holds true for the CBS-P2 sequence , which is similar to that of CBS-P1 and also binds CysB protein more tightly in the presence of acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since N-acetyl-L-serine inhibits binding to CBS-P3 and stimulates binding to CBS-P1 and CBS-P2 , the two-protein complex noted in the presence of CysB this effector probably contains a separate tetramer at each of the last two sites ( Fig. 4 ) .

<li>Our interpretation of these data is summarized in Fig. 4 , which shows a single CysB tetramer binding simultaneously to both CBS-K1 and CBS-K2 in the cysK promoter and bending the DNA at or near the junction between the two binding sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine , a single CysB tetramer binds to both the CBS-K1 and CBS-K2 sites of the cysK promoter or to CBS-P3 in the cysP promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>We have proposed that this phenomenon is caused by the ability of CysB to bind to adjacent sites in the cysK and cysP promoters and bend DNA , which is known to cause anomalously slow electrophoretic mobility ( 63 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>CysB was found to bind as a tetramer , and N-acetyl-L-serine increased the electrophoretic mobilities of one-protein complexes of the multibinding site cysK and cysP promoters without changing their stoichiometry , indicating that a single CysB tetramer can bend these promoters and that N-acetyl-L-serine diminishes such bending .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>CysB is known to bind to activation sites just upstream of the 235 regions of the positively regulated cysJIH , cysK , and cysP promoters and to a repressor site centered at about 11 in the cysB promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>CysB binds to specific sites just upstream of the -35 regions of the cysJIH , cysK , and cysP promoters , where , in the presence of N-acetyl-L-serine , it stimulates transcription initiation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>Purified CysB protein has been shown in vitro to bind to sequences immediately upstream of the -35 regions of the S. typhimurium cysJIH and cysK promoters and to activate transcription from these promoters in the presence of acetyl-L-serine ( 27 , 29 , 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1706701" target="_blank">1706701</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this report , we demonstrate that CysB protein binds to DNA sequences immediately upstream of the -35 regions of both the cysK and cysJIH promoters and that there are two binding sites for the cysK promoter and a single site for the cysJIH promoter .

<li>The footprint in the absence of N-acetyl-L-serine extended along the same face of the DNA duplex for about 70 bp , which is consistent with gel shift binding and stoichiometric data indicating that a single CysB tetramer binds to this region of the cysP promoter and bends it ( 17 , 18 ) .

<li>Although most of the sequence ANNCCNTNNTT extends beyond the downstream boundary of DNase I protection for CBS-K1 , it may confer binding specificity since it is retained in a deletion ( pRSM124 ) that lacks promoter activity but still binds to CysB protein ( Fig. 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although CysB protein binding sites have not been demonstrated for the E. coli cysD promoter , the sequence immediately upstream of the -35 region of that promoter ( 25 ) can also be aligned to show nucleotide identities at 8 of these 12 positions ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ability of CysB protein to respond to acetyl-L-serine with either an increase or a decrease in affinity for different DNA raises the question of whether these two sequences of binding the regions of the types occur at same or separate protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1706701" target="_blank">1706701</a>]<br></li>
<li>The demonstration of two binding sites for CysB protein in the cysK promoter region suggested a model in which the binding of two CysB protein molecules forms the slow complex observed in gel mobility shift binding studies and binding of a single protein forms the fast complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>This finding is consistent with bending of the DNA of the slow complex at a point more centrally located in fragment A than in fragment B , i.e. , in or near the CysB protein-binding sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>Preliminary data indicate that the prohibit topography of these cysJIH promoter sites should a single CysB tetramer from binding to two of them simultaneously .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since these two sites are situated on almost opposite faces of the helix , it seems unlikely that a single CysB can bind simultaneously to both , and we attribute the protection noted with N-acetyl-L-serine to binding by two separate tetramers ( 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>( A ) N-acetyl-L-serine stimulation of binding when half-sites are convergent and separated by 1 to 3 bp ; ( B ) N-acetyl-L-serine inhibition of binding to sites with divergently oriented half-sites separated by one or two turns of the helix ; ( C ) regions in the cysP and cysK promoters that contain a half-site oriented toward an activation site and separated from it by 12 or 13 bp are bent by CysB but less so in the presence of N-acetyl-L-serine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>Protection of both sites in the presence of acetyl-L-serine almost certainly involves binding by two separate CysB protein molecules , since a single 144-kDa tetramer would have to be unusually elongated to protect regions that are separated by as many as 110 bp .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , CysB appears to recognize speciÔ¨Åc determinants on either side of position 250 and is sufÔ¨Åciently Ô¨Çexible to contact them and activate promoters in which the distances between these determinants vary by 1 bp .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730263" target="_blank">7730263</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our finding that only a single CysB tetramer binds to a 45-bp site attribute of LysR-type proteins may be indicative of a common in recognizing large binding sites , which have been reported to be between 36 and 55 bp for OxyR ( 56 ) , AmpR ( 33 ) , NodD ( 11 ) , NahR ( 25 , 53 ) , and OccR ( 61 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>The cysK and cysP promoters contain additional binding sites , and we have proposed that CysB bends these promoters by binding to adjacent sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8206845" target="_blank">8206845</a>]<br></li>
<li>Steric hindrance would probably prevent binding of second CysB to a complex already containing a CysB bound to both sites , and if such a complex were formed , we would expect its electrophoretic mobility to increase with N-acetyl-L-serine , which it does not .

<li>In this state all operons in the CysB regulon were induced between 14 - and 68-fold ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18957594" target="_blank">18957594</a>]<br></li>
<li>The cysB promoter also has a single CysB protein binding site , designated CBS-B , which is located between positions -10 and +36 relative to the major transcription start site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1909324" target="_blank">1909324</a>]<br></li>
<li>cysK , which encodes the enzyme O-acetylserine ( thiol ) - lyase A ( 11 ) , also requires CysB protein and inducer for maximal expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2254265" target="_blank">2254265</a>]<br></li>
<li>Microarray analysis of E. coli during sulfur starvation found increased expression of ahpCF encoding an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase positively regulated by OxyR , and the CysB regulon has been shown by microarray analysis to be expressed in cells stressed by methyl viologen ( Blanchard et al. , 2007 ; Gyaneshwar et al. , 2005 ) .

<li>We report here that the cysG gene was not regulated in response to cysteine levels and that its expression did not require the CysB activator protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8383112" target="_blank">8383112</a>]<br></li>
<li>Arginine decarboxylase expression is increased by CysB binding its promoter , and cysB mutants do not ferment many carbohydrates as well as the parent strains of E. coli and S. typhimurium ( Quan et al. , 2002 ; Shi & Bennett , 1994 ) .

<li>CysB positively regulates at least six different promoters within the cysteine regulon by activating transcription initiation in the presence of the inducer N-acetyl-L-serine ( 32 ) and negatively autoregulates its own expression from cysB ( 3 , 23 , 34 ) .

<li>The expression of the cysteine regulon is controlled by the CysB protein , which serves as a specific transcription activator for genes of the biosynthetic pathway ( 18 , 21 , 34 , 39 ) and as a repressor for its own gene , cysB ( 5 , 17 , 41 ) .

<li>The marked difference in cat expression between pRSM119 ( 3.4 U/mg ) and pRSM120 ( 0.8 U/mg ) in DW48 was not observed in the wild-type host and suggests that positions -77 and -76 of the cysK promoter region may be more important for transcription activation by the CysB protein encoded by cysB1352 than for activation by the wild-type protein .
