<li>osmY Periplasmic protein of unknown function ; can respond to katF/rpoS sigma factor for induction RecA protein , a key member of the SOS response regulon involved in DNA repair and recombination controls the umuDC operon , where umuD and umuC are essential for SOS mutagenesis through modiﬁcation of PolIII Antisense RNA down-regulating outer membrane protein ompF ; induction requires oxidative-stress-induced SoxS protein An ATPase , presumed to be a molecular chaperone since it is a homologue of a heat-shock protein ( hsp140 ) in yeast A protein induced by DNA damage as part of the SOS response , but whose function is currently unknown Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , induced by superoxide-generating agents superoxide radical inducible protein , induced by superoxide radical anion generators such as paraquat An AP endonuclease involved in repair of apurinic/apyrimidinic DNA damage , which can result from oxidative damage Hydrogen peroxidase I , a tetrameric bifunctional catalase , regulated by katF/rpoS Universal stress protein , a protein of unknown function that increases under stress conditions that inhibit growth A protein regulating the mercury resistance mer operon , with signiﬁcant homology to the SoxR ( redox regulating ) protein A multifunctional protein that removes alkyl groups from alkylated DNA , and a transcriptional-activator in the ada regulon 15 , 34 , 38 33.1 a 0.8 35.7 14.4 NaGlC NaUDC NaCDC NaDOC -- 5.9 -- 11 ( 2 -- 23 ) 6 ( 0 -- 19 ) 87 ( 23 -- 247 ) 3.2 46.5 recA 7 a From ratio of glycine : taurine amidates and percent cholate .

<li>However , since SoxR and SoxS are regulators that affect many components in the cell , more biochemical analysis needs be done to test whether GTP cyclohydrolase II becomes labile in the presence of superoxide radicals .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8709966" target="_blank">8709966</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of SoxR ( in EH120 ) , the modiﬁed fusion was still inducible by PQ , although to a 2-fold lower level than seen for the unmodiﬁed promoter ( in EH40 ; Figure 5B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since six proteins are all required to maintain the low level of soxS expression , it is most likely that RsxA , B , C , D , G and E proteins might all act together in reducing SoxR , possibly as a complex , as their homologs may do in R.capsulatus in reducing nitrogenase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of Rsx and RseC proteins , a back-up system may operate to reduce SoxR , as hinted at by the slow return of the elevated soxS mRNA to the uninduced level in the rsx and rseC mutants .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>Oxidation of SoxR could be mediated by oxygen , a possibility that in part would explain the conditional nature of the SoxRc mutations , that is , the strong dependence on aerobic-growth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>As a control for expression of the SoxR proteins , under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions , we used the compound diamide , which gives modest induction of soxS independent of oxygen ( Privalle et al. , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , changes in reductase activity alone are not likely to explain either the enhanced activation of SoxR by NO · under anaerobic compared to aerobic conditions ( Nunoshiba et al. , 1993 ) or the anaerobic induction by the thiol oxidant diamide ( Privalle et al. , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under anaerobic conditions ( Figure 4B ) , the diamide-mediated induction was still observed for wild-type SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>As seen in Figure 4A , aerobic soxS expression was induced by diamide in strain TN5311-pSXR ( wild-type SoxR ) but was expressed at constitutively high levels in the presence of the SoxRc proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>Wild-Type SoxR or SoxRc-Mediated soxS Expression under Aerobic and Anaerobic Conditions Cells expressing either wild-type SoxR ( TN5311-pSXR ) or SoxRc ( TN5315-pTN101 , TN5315-pTN102 , or TN5315-pTN104 ) proteins were grown under aerobic ( A ) or anaerobic ( B ) conditions and under uninduced ( untreated ) or induced ( 0.5 mM diamide ) conditions , as described in Experimental Procedures .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>pBD100 was incubated as described above under anaerobic conditions in the presence of air-oxidized SoxR proteins ( lanes 1 ) , dithionite-reduced SoxR proteins ( 2450 6 20 mV ; lanes 2 ) , or potassium ferricyanide-reoxidized SoxR proteins ( 1100 6 20 mV ; lanes3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>When indicated , purified SoxR proteins were incubated at the concentrations noted above inside an anaerobic cuvette inthe presence of the redox mediatorsafranine O ( 10 mM ) in 100 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ) and a redox microelectrode .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>Redox Titration of Wild-Type and SoxRc Proteins To estimate the midpoint redox potential of the wild-type and SoxRc proteins , samples of 2.5 ml of z15 mM SoxR protein were equilibratedwith argonfor z60 min at room temperature inside an anaerobic redox cuvette ( Dutton , 1978 ; Ding et al. , 1996 ) in the presence of the redox mediator safranine O , present at 3 mM ( E0 5 2289 mV [ pH 7.6 ] ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alternatively , hydrogen peroxide might lead to the generation of another signal that activates SoxR or to inefﬁcient SoxR reduction , by as yet uncharacterized mechanisms .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11443091" target="_blank">11443091</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , this difference could not account for a greater than 50-fold difference in their activities and therefore could not support a model in which oxidation activates SoxR by enabling it to-bind to DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>This strongly implicates the following chain of events : activation of SoxR by paraquat-generated superoxides activates the synthesis of SoxS , which in turn activates the mar promoter , provided that the mar/soxbox sequences between nt 1339 and 1364 are present .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the increased production of MarA ( caused by some environmental chemicals , such as salicylate , inactivating its cognate repressor , MarR ) or SoxS ( caused by the inactivation of its repressor SoxR via its oxidation ) or the binding of coregulators such as dipyridyl ( 561 ) or some bile salts ( 558 ) to Rob activates the transcription of micF antisense RNA , decreasing OmpF synthesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14665678" target="_blank">14665678</a>]<br></li>
<li>Effects of SoxR and oxidative-stress on the expression of single-copy acnA - , fumA - , fumS - and fumC-lacZ fusions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>NO also induces SoxR-mediated expression of several genes involved in oxidative-stress responses ( 35 ) , but NO induction of F ( hmp-lacZ ) 1 expression was largely independent of SoxR ( Table 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8808940" target="_blank">8808940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , SoxR mediates an approximately fourfold induction of oxidative response gene expression ( at 200 ml of NO gas per 2 ml of culture ; 35 ) , whereas F ( hmp-lacZ ) 1 expression was induced approximately 20-fold by only 20 mM NO in solution ( Table 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8808940" target="_blank">8808940</a>]<br></li>
<li>For SoxR and OxyR , the corresponding gene products decrease the extent of intracellular oxidative-stress ( e.g. catalase , superoxide dismutase ) and repair damaged macromolecules ( 15 , 38 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22223481" target="_blank">22223481</a>]<br></li>
<li>This versatility would let the SoxR system respond to a wide range of environmental and intracellular changes indicative of possible oxidative-stress .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11073934" target="_blank">11073934</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , these observations suggest that pre-existing SoxR senses the onset of oxidative-stress ( either increased superoxide levels or decreased NADPH/NADP '' ratio ) via the proposed metalbinding domain and then activated SoxR transmits this signai to the regulon by transcriptionally activating soxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>OxyR and SoxR activate fur expression upon H O or superoxide ( i.e. redox-cycling drugs ( 14 ) ) 2 2 treatment by 10-fold , leading to a 2-fold increase in Fur protein ( 39 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22223481" target="_blank">22223481</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR and SoxS , which modulate the response to superoxide-gener-ating compounds , activate the expression of a transcript encoding both ﬂavodoxin and Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10419964" target="_blank">10419964</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under condition of excess superoxide generation , all SoxR will be converted into the completely oxidized state , and thus it makes sense that paraquat treatment further increases the soxS expression in the mutant to the maximum level comparable with the full induction level in the wild-type ( Figures 3 and 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>To directly compare the induction of OxyR and SoxR target genes by both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide-gen-erating compounds , we treated wild-type cells with either 0 , 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.3 , and 1 mM hydrogen peroxide or the same concentrations of paraquat ( methyl viologen ) , a standard inducer of the soxRS regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11443091" target="_blank">11443091</a>]<br></li>
<li>Treatment with superoxide-generating compounds , such as paraquat , activates SoxR , which , in turn , transcriptionally activates the expression of soxS ( 5 , 10 , 31 , 46 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097628" target="_blank">21097628</a>]<br></li>
<li>As expected , oxyS was strongly induced by all concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and soxS was induced by all concentrations of paraquat , consistent with the notion that OxyR primarily senses hydrogen peroxide while SoxR primarily responds to superoxide-generating compounds .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11443091" target="_blank">11443091</a>]<br></li>
<li>Figure 1a indicates the up-regulations of soxR and sodA in response to acidic condition , where this may be the result of limiting the availability of such compounds as NADPH ( Liochev et al. 1994 ) or reduced ﬂavodoxins or ferreodoxins , which are necessary to maintain SoxR in its reduced form ( Dukan et al. 1996 ) .

<li>Whereas OxyR responds primarily to H2O2 and nitrosylating agents , SoxR is known to respond primarily to superoxide and nitric oxide ( Nunoshiba et al. , 1993 ; Hausladen et al. , 1996 ; Storz and Imlay , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>Several proximate intracellular signals that activate SoxR have been proposed ; superoxide may be one of the reasonable candidates because of oxygen dependency of the soxRS induction by redox-cycling agents ŽGreenberg et al. , 1990 ; Nunoshiba et al. , 1992 ; Wu and Weiss , 1992 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9093389" target="_blank">9093389</a>]<br></li>
<li>In a similar way , whereas most of the hydrogen peroxide-induced genes are regulated by OxyR , some genes are still induced by hydrogen peroxide in the absence of OxyR or SoxR , suggesting the presence of other regulator ( s ) responding to peroxide stress ( Zheng et al. , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15009899" target="_blank">15009899</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , the SoxR homologue , MerR , is dimeric both in the presence and in the absence of the Hg21 ( Helmann et al. , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>Escherichia coli cells utilize two transcription factors OxyR and SoxR to sense the oxidants and then induce various genes against oxidative-stress that are involved in removing oxidants , repairing damaged cell components and maintaining reducing conditions in the cell ( Bauer et al. , 1999 ; Storz and Imlay , 1999 ; Pomposiello and Demple , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>Diverse types of redox sensors have been characterized , such as SoxR , OxyR , Fnr and ArcB ( Spiro and Guest , 1990 ; Amabile-Cuevas and Demple , 1991 ; Zheng et al. , 1998 ; Georgellis et al. , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23506073" target="_blank">23506073</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA transcription is controlled by the repressor function of MarR ( encoded within the marRAB operon ; Cohen et al. , 1993 ) , whereas SoxS transcription depends on its activation by SoxR ( encoded within the soxRS region ; Amabile-Cuevas & Demple , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>It did not respond to manganese availability ; it was not induced by redox-cycling drugs , which indicates that it is not regulated by SoxR ( 16 , 47 ) ; it was not affected by Fur , IscR , Hfq , RpoS , or YaaA itself .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21378183" target="_blank">21378183</a>]<br></li>
<li>The use of similar sensing mechanisms by structurally unrelated transcription factors , such as OxyR and SoxR , suggests that there may be a limited number of biologically effective solutions to the problem of setting transcriptional switches within specific redox windows The conformational changes induced in CRP , FNR and FNR-like proteins upon perception of the appropriate signal ` switch ' the regulators from their inactive to active forms .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11407111" target="_blank">11407111</a>]<br></li>
<li>These include SoxR , OxyR , FNR , MetR , and Fur ( 5 , 6 , 10 , 12 , 17 ) , though in each case the principal function of the regulator is to sense another signal ( superoxide , hydrogen peroxide , oxygen , homocysteine , and iron , respectively ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16428390" target="_blank">16428390</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , nitrosylation of iron atoms , especially ironsulfur clusters , in enzymes such as aconitase and fumarase or in the transcription factors FNR , Fur , SoxR , OxyR , and NsrR inactivates their functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22029434" target="_blank">22029434</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , we propose that the E. coli response to reactive nitrogen species is brought about by the modification of some transcription factors , such as NorR , that control the expression of NO detoxifying activities and are dedicated to sensing reactive nitrogen species , and other redoxactive transcription factors such as Fur , SoxR , and OxyR , where the reaction with reactive nitrogen species is incidental .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is interesting to note that NorR , Fur , SoxR , and OxyR all appear to contain redox-active cysteines and , in some cases , iron .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>We suggest that NorR , and perhaps the unidentified regulators , were evolved to sense reactive nitrogen species , whereas Fur , SoxR , and OxyR were evolved to sense iron and reactive oxygen species and are collaterally activated by reactive nitrogen species .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , iscS is potentially important for global transcriptional regulation because several transcriptional-regulators , such as SoxR [ 19 ] , IscR [ 20 ] , Fnr [ 21 ] , and YeiL [ 22 ] , carry Fe -- S clusters as an essential prosthetic group .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18482579" target="_blank">18482579</a>]<br></li>
<li>This effect could be due to subtle changes in the SoxR -- DNA contacts upon activation , for which there is some evidence from footprinting assays ( Hidalgo and Demple , 1994 ; Hidalgo et al. , 1995 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , the A3 subdomain of HyfR contains a cysteine-rich segment ( - C-X , - H-C-X-C-X-P-X-C-X-P - ; Fig. 4 ) which could serve as a binding site for a metal cofactor or iron-sulphur cluster , endowing the HyfR protein with the ability to respond to changes in redox and/or oxygen status as for the FNR , IRP and SoxR transcriptional-regulator proteins ( Hidalgo et al. , 1995 ; Rouault & Klausner , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9387241" target="_blank">9387241</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under conditions in which superoxide radicals are expected to accumulate , such as exposure to redox cycling agents or hyperbaric oxygen , pre-existing SoxR protein is converted from an inactive form to an activated species , presumably by a redox-sensing mechanism involving ironsulphur clusters co-ordinated near the C-terminus of the protein ( Hidalgo and Demple , 1994 ; Wu eta / .

<li>Whether SoxR regulates fumC and acnA by direct binding to their promoters , when under low iron availability , or through an intermediate other than SoxS , remains to be established .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11470373" target="_blank">11470373</a>]<br></li>
<li>NO binds to the binuclear center of SoxR , forming a dinitrosyl-iron-dithiol active complex that induces soxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15546870" target="_blank">15546870</a>]<br></li>
<li>NO is a damaging agent of iron-sulfur clusters , and apart from the wide variety of iron-sulfur-containing proteins involved in relevant pathways , the formation of these clusters is essential at least for the transcriptionally active form of regulators such as FNR , IscR , and SoxR ( 26 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15546870" target="_blank">15546870</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to the activation within NO-generating macrophages ( 11 ) , those studies showed that infusion of pure NO gas activates SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10805777" target="_blank">10805777</a>]<br></li>
<li>The studies presented here reveal a novel , direct role for NO in signal transduction : modification of iron-sulfur centers in SoxR directly activates its transcriptional activity ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10805777" target="_blank">10805777</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , natural selection solved two opposing problems in evolving SoxR as an activator : enhancing initiation by RNAP when SoxR is activated , without impairing RNAP binding when the bound SoxR is in the non-activated form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activated and non-activated SoxR bind this site equally well , exerting nearly constant repression of soxR ; activated SoxR simultaneously stimulates the soxS ≥ promoter 30-fold .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , without changing its occupancy of this single operator site , SoxR simultaneously exerts constant repression of one gene and conditional activation of the neighboring gene .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>To overexpress these proteins , salicylate ( SAL ) can be used to block the activity of MarR ( Martin & Rosner , 1995 ) and paraquat ( PQ ) can oxidize and hence activate SoxR ( Demple , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under our conditions , no binding activity was detected in PQ-treated cells that did not overexpress SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data indicate that DTT reversibly blocks the transcriptional activity of Fe-SoxR by destabilizing the [ 2Fe-2S ] centers , which can then be physically removed in the continuing presence of high levels of DTT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>A similar destabilizing effect seems to be mediated by DTT , high concentrations of which also abolish the transcriptional activity of Fe-SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>DTT Treatment of Purified Fe-SoxR Fractions -- SoxR protein was incubated aerobically with increasing concentrations of DTT ( 10 to 100 mM ) for 10 min at room temperature .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of 100 mM DTT , the transcriptional activity of Fe-SoxR was abolished ( Fig. 5B , lane 3 versus lane 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>We further analyzed the effect DTT had on Fe-SoxR by gel filtration chromatography in the absence or the presence of 100 mM DTT in the column buffer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results indicate the presence of a cellular pathway for countering the autooxidation of SoxR and confirm the hypothesis that induction of the regulon is mediated by a shift in the redox equilibrium of SoxR rather than by assembly of its Fe -- S clusters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Band retardation caused by the presence of SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11470373" target="_blank">11470373</a>]<br></li>
<li>The integrated intensity indicated the presence of 1 spin/2 .2 Fe ( 1.3 spin/SoxR monomer ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>Instead , this result indicates the presence of a cellular system for regenerating reduced Fe -- S centers in SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , in another study ( 7 ) , the Fe -- S centers of purified SoxR that were disrupted by glutathione reportedly did not reassemble anaerobically in the presence of dithionite .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the integrity of Fe-SoxR was not strongly compromised by the footprinting reagents , although partial effects were noted .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , SoxR may exist primarily as SoxRred in the uninduced cell , and the mechanism of its activation in vivo , as well as in vitro , may be by oxidation of its Fe-S centers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is also possible that apo-SoxR is the physiologically relevant inactive state .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>This finding contradicts the theory that in uninduced cells , the inactive state of SoxR is due to the dissociation of its Fe -- S centers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>This hypothesis was tested by sedimentation analysis of both Fe - and apo-SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>Reactions were performed using pBD100 as the template , and σ70-containing RNAP ( 1 U ; ~ 1 µg ) alone or in the presence of transcriptionally active Fe-SoxR ( 10 ng ) or inactive apo-SoxR ( 10 ng ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , lowering the thiol concentration by dilution allowed spontaneous regeneration of active Fe-SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like SoxR0x , the SoxR apoprotein ( lacking Fe-S centers ) is also able to-bind to the soxS operator and to exist as a dimer , although it is not transcriptionally active ( 12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to the activation of DNA binding observed in RclR , however , OxyR and SoxR bind to DNA in both their reduced and oxidized forms , with oxidation resulting in structural changes that lead to transcriptional activation ( 47 , 61 ) .

<li>A plausible hypothesis was that in the uninduced cell , they exist in a reduced state and deform SoxR so as to block its binding to the soxS promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>With metal bound ( or in the oxidized state of the Fe-S cluster in the case of SoxR ) , some of these hypersensitivities are significantly decreased ( 37 , 49 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10608803" target="_blank">10608803</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this study , we overcome these problems and demonstrate that oxidized SoxR is reversibly inactivated by reduction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>O. 2 , or some product thereof , might effect this steady state by directly oxidizing reduced SoxR and/or inhibiting the reduction of oxidized SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10092630" target="_blank">10092630</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , we found that in the presence of regulon inducers , the concentration of SoxR decreased and that the red remainder of SoxR was in an oxidized state , i.e. it could generate an EPR signal after reduction by dithionite .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR that has been purified aerobically from cells that were not induced by paraquat or similar agents is in an oxidized form ( 12 , 13 ) , and it is as active as SoxR from paraquat-induced cells ( J. Wu and B.W. , unpublished data ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR is maintained in vivo in a reduced , inactive form ; it is activated by a shift to its oxidized state when cellular reducing equivalents are depleted by the formation of O2 - from 02 - It was further suggested ( 11 ) that NADPH might reduce SoxR , a ferredoxin-like protein , via reactions linked to ferredoxin or flavodoxin and their reductase ( Fpr ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is by oxidative cycling , using O2 as a final electron acceptor , that these compounds induce the regulon by depleting the cell of the reducing equivalents needed to keep SoxR in a reduced form in the presence of O2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>In uninduced cells , 90 % of the SoxR was in the reduced form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the uninduced cell , SoxR is mainly in its inactive , reduced form , and because it is auto-oxidizable , it must be continually reduced .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10714981" target="_blank">10714981</a>]<br></li>
<li>The puri ® ed RsxC exhibits NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reducing activity in vitro even in the absence of SoxR , implying that it can transfer electrons from NADPH ( M.-S .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>The in vitro activation and the sequence of metal-dependent changes in the ZntR footprinting data show many similarities with those obtained for MerR ( 22 , 24 , 25 , 37 ) and SoxR , another MerR homologue in E. coli that responds to oxidative-stress ( 40 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10608803" target="_blank">10608803</a>]<br></li>
<li>The general model for the oxidative regulation of SoxR was supported by our previous finding that in vitro , SoxR could be reversibly inactivated by reduction with dithionite under an-aerobic conditions ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>The presence of these prosthetic groups , which , like 027 , are capable of univalent oxidation and reduction , immediately suggested that these are the sensor elements that mediate the activation of SoxR .

<li>After visualization of marker RNAs ( 1.77 , 1.52 , 1.28 , 0.78 , 0.53 , 0.40 , 0.28 and 0.15 kb ) with methylene blue , the ﬁlters were hybridized with a soxS-speciﬁc probe as a positive control for the in vivo activation of SoxR protein by PQ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>While the soxS gene is under the redox-regulated , positive control of SoxR , marA is under negative control by MarR , a repressor whose DNA-binding activity is regulated by the binding of small molecules with toxic effects ( 1 , 31 , 39 ) .

<li>The similarity of MarA and SoxS with respect to amino acid sequence homology , DNA recognition , and transcriptional activation properties suggests that they arose initially by gene duplication and then diverged to accommodate the constraints mandated by their speciﬁc stimulus-responsive regulatory systems : the salicylate-sensitive negative control mediated by MarR and the superoxide-sensitive positive control mediated by SoxR .

<li>The mechanism of target gene activation by oxidized SoxR involves promoter distortion , being similar to that by MerR in response to Hg2 + ( Ansari et al. , 1995 ; Hidalgo and Demple , 1997 ) and to that by another MerR family member ZntR in response to Zn2 + ( Outten et al. , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , the only known homologs of SoxR , the MerR family of gene regulators , employ a similar cluster of cysteines to-bind Hg2 + and stimulate transcriptional activation by MerR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>The predicted SoxR and SoxS proteins are each related to a distinct family of bacterial regulatory proteins that control responses to environmental change , and may act sequentially to activate the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>
<li>The 17.1-kDa SoxR protein bears significant homology only to the MerR family of proteins including a predicted DNA-binding helix-turn-helix and a cluster of cysteine residues positioned similarly to those that regulate the activity of MerR in response to Hg2 + .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>
<li>The SoxR protein is homologous to the MerR family of proteins ( 1 ) , which activate transcription of the mer operon in response to Hg2 + ( 2 , 16 , 23 , 25 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR protein is a member of the MerR family of proteins , which activate transcription of the mer operon in response to Hg2 + .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8899708" target="_blank">8899708</a>]<br></li>
<li>These observations suggest that the critical effect of activated SoxR on transcription occurs at a later stage , perhaps by specific conformational effects of Fe-SoxR1 on DNA , as proposed for the homologous MerR protein ( Ansari et al. , 1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although MarA homologue SoxS was also shown to regulate the transcription of acrAB strongly ( Ma et al. , 1996 ; White et al. , 1997 ) , SoxS , also a small protein of 107 residues , exerts its action by altering the level of its own expression , which is regulated via SoxR by oxidizing agents that generate the superoxide radical ( Greenberg et al. , 1990 ; Ding et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>To reduce SoxR for transcription experiments , we used an excess of sodium dithionite and paraquat under anaerobic conditions ( see Materials and Methods ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whereas the fumA promoter is regulated by both Fnr and ArcA , transcription from the fumC promoter is regulated by ArcA and SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592392" target="_blank">7592392</a>]<br></li>
<li>In a ﬁrst attempt to conﬁrm whether SoxR represses transcription of its own gene in vivo , we fused a 0.35 kb DNA fragment of the soxRS locus to the lacZ reporter gene ( see Materials and methods ; Figure 2A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>This result conﬁrms that SoxR represses transcription of its own gene in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR represses transcription of its own gene in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both MerR and SoxR can repress and activate transcription by binding to the same site on the DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11251844" target="_blank">11251844</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , SoxR binding to the single site that mediates soxS activation also represses soxR transcription under all conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>( A ) Under inducing conditions , only activated SoxR triggers transcription of soxS ; both active and inactive SoxR bind to its DNA site ( white box ) and strongly repress transcription of the soxR gene .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>The soxS-containing plasmid pBD100 was incubated with RNA polymerase in the presence or absence of 10 ng of active ( FeSoxR ) or inactive ( apoSoxR ) wild-type SoxR or Fecontaining SoxRc proteins ( SoxR101 , SoxR102 , or SoxR104 ) in in vitro transcription reactions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the effect of SoxR protein on soxR transcription in vitro was the inverse of its effect on soxS : addition of Fe-SoxR completely inhibited the transcription of soxR ( Figure 1B , lane 2 ) , and apo-SoxR seemed to have a partial inhibitory effect ( Figure 1B , lane 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , they demonstrated that oxidized Fe-SoxR , but not apo-SoxR , can stimulate soxS transcription in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>The consequent increase in electrostatic repulsion between the two SoxR monomers drives the conformational changes that activate transcription of the adjacent soxS gene .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11407111" target="_blank">11407111</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Fe-containing SoxRc proteins displayed the same ability as wild-type Fe-SoxR to activate transcription of the soxS gene in vitro ( Figure 2B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>The activity of SoxR was tested by its ability to enable the transcription of its target gene , soxS , in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of soxS , whose transcription is controlled directly by SoxR was induced 5-fold by both GSNO and NaNO2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>The regulon is controlled by [ 2Fe ^ 2S ] SoxR , which activates the transcription of soxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11470373" target="_blank">11470373</a>]<br></li>
<li>The active ( oxidized or nitrosylated ) form of SoxR activates transcription of the soxS gene up to 100-fold .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whereas the effect on Fur and FNR caused transcription alterations in the genes under their control , that of SoxR was unexpected ; although a large increase upon the transcription of soxS occurred , a corresponding increase on the SoxRS regulon could not be detected .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15546870" target="_blank">15546870</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , any change in the EPR pattern after induction would have to be attributed to SoxR rather than to any other product of the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxRS regulon activation by H2O2 depends on SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11073934" target="_blank">11073934</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR regulates the induction of SoxRS regulon transcription by H2O2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11073934" target="_blank">11073934</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , a single nucleotide change in the soxS promoter results in repression by SoxR , which normally activates , regardless of the redox signal [ 48 ] ; and just 1 -- 2 amino acid replacements in a regulatory protein can alter the range of coactivators or change the effect of an inducer to that of a corepressor [ 49,50 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18405378" target="_blank">18405378</a>]<br></li>
<li>The induction of soxRS regulon genes ( sodA , nfo , zwf , and micF ) in cells expressing high levels of SoxS and in the absence of SoxR protein or a redox stimulus ( 1 ) is consistent with this model , although direct activation of other genes ( e.g. , soi-28 ) by SoxR has not been ruled out .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regulation of the acnA and fum gene expression by SoxRS The soxRS oxidative-stress regulon responds to superoxide-generating agents such as methyl viologen , by a two-stage process in which the SoxR protein is thought to serve as a redox-sensing activator of the adjacent so.xS gene , followed in turn by the activation of regulon genes bv the SoxS protein ( Amabile-Cuevas & Demple , 1991 ; Hildago & Demple , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results support the hypothesis of two-stage regulation ( 7 ) , in which the redox-activated SoxR protein binds the soxS promoter to activate transcription and the elevated levels of SoxS protein induce the various soxRS regulon genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>The soxRS regulon is controlled by a two-stage system in which the SoxR protein is a redox-sensing transcriptional-activator of the soxS gene , whose product subsequently activates the various soxRS regulon genes ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8226698" target="_blank">8226698</a>]<br></li>
<li>A two-stage control system was hypothesized for soxRS , in which an intracellular redox signal would trigger the SoxR protein as a transcriptional-activator of the soxS gene and the resulting increased levels of SoxS protein would activate transcription of the various soxRS regulon genes ( B. Demple and C. F. Amaibile Cuevas , Cell 67:837 -839 , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activated SoxR enhances the production of SoxS , a simple transcriptional-activator of the AraC family , which in turn , increases the transcription of the other genes of the regulon ( 4 , 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>When oxidized , SoxR activates the transcription of soxS , and the resulting SoxS protein activates genes that collectively help to avoid or repair the damage caused by oxidants ( 13 , 18 , 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon activation , SoxR induces expression of the soxS gene in response to superoxide-generating agents , and then SoxS activates transcription of genes within the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16760308" target="_blank">16760308</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although Rob , SoxS and MarA activate micF transcription in response to different environmental stimuli , there is some overlap in response .14 soxS is part of the soxRS regulon .66 SoxR is a sensor protein activated by oxidative-stress and in turn it transcriptionally activates soxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11601842" target="_blank">11601842</a>]<br></li>
<li>Induction occurs in a two-step cascade : ( i ) SoxR protein that is activated by oxidative-stress induces the transcription of soxS and ( ii ) SoxS protein then activates the transcription of other genes ( 5 , 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>We are establishing an in vitro system to characterize transcriptional stimulation by SoxR , which provide an for inducers that activate may assay the protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>We tested whether the negative effect of soxS + could also be detected when the synthesis of SoxS protein was decoupled from control by SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8226698" target="_blank">8226698</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , increased soxS levels were reported for NorE5 as was the expression of a truncated form of the SoxR protein leading to constitutive SoxS transcriptional activity ( Fabrega et al. , 2010 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>have reported that nitric oxide can directly activate SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9093389" target="_blank">9093389</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since in this case the activation of SoxR under anaerobic condition was much stronger than seen under aerobic one , the mechanism of the soxRS-induction by CuSO4 may not be related to nitric oxide .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9093389" target="_blank">9093389</a>]<br></li>
<li>Polyclonal antisera were extracted periodically starting 4 weeks after the first injection , and SoxR-specific antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using SoxR-columns generated by coupling purified SoxR protein to HiTrap NHS -- activated columns ( Pharmacia ) according to the conditions recommended by the supplier .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because this increase in SoxRred occurred in the presence of spectinomycin , an inhibitor of protein synthesis , it does not represent newly synthesized SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>This induction is mediated by the SoxR protein , since it is abolished in a DsoxR mutant and induced in a soxR * strain even without the presence of paraquat .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592392" target="_blank">7592392</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR is readily autooxidized , and the protein that is isolated in ambient atmosphere from uninduced cells is transcriptionally active ( 6 , 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , we can not distinguish whether both inactive and activated forms of SoxR bind the soxS promoter or the protein extraction process itself converts SoxR to an active form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>At the whether the moment , we can not say SoxR protein extracted under our conditions is active or inactive for stimulation of RNA polymerase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the rate of cytochrome c reduction by the protein was enhanced ~ 7 - to 10-fold when SoxR was added , the protein was inferred to be SoxR reductase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR protein , ; 10 mM in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH , pH 7.6 , 0.5 M NaCl , was reduced with dithionite under anaerobic conditions ( see text for details ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>RclR now joins the relatively small group of regulators whose functions are specifically activated by oxidation ( e.g. OxyR and SoxR ) ( 13 , 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24078635" target="_blank">24078635</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , SoxR can also be activated by nitric oxide ( NO ) by direct nitrosylation of the iron-sulfur clusters ( 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>The iron -- sulfur cluster-containing SoxR protein initially was identified as the sensor of the stress generated by O - - generating 2 compounds , but subsequent studies revealed that SoxR also can be activated by NO ( 26 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>The soxRS regulon is also switched on in two regulatory steps , but in this case only the SoxR protein pre-exists and is activated during superoxide or nitric oxide stress .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of acnA ( aconitase A ) is also activated by SoxR alone when under iron deprivation , but not of sodA ( Mn-superoxide-dismutase ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11470373" target="_blank">11470373</a>]<br></li>
<li>The present observations provide a simple explanation for this difference : in the case of SoxR , the protein can be activated by oxidation by normal metabolites ( O2 · 2 or O ) , but for MerR , significant amounts of activating Hg21 2 are not normally present .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>The concentration of SoxR protein in the EPR tubes was also measured by densitometry following SDS-PAGE .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>The diversity of genes activated by OxyR and SoxR illustrates the variety of cellular defense mechanisms against oxi-dative stress .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>In E. coli , the SoxR and OxyR regulatory proteins are activated by NO , and mutants with defects in these systems are more sensitive to RNIs and nitrosative stress ( 7 , 12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12142437" target="_blank">12142437</a>]<br></li>
<li>In subtle differences , oxyR is robustly activated in response to oxidative-stress [ 6 ] while mar/sox are activated by inhibition of the MarR repressor [ 7 ] and by oxidization of SoxR [ 8,9 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21059273" target="_blank">21059273</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , in vivo probes of the mechanism that activates SoxR in response to oxidative-stress have been lacking .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>The SoxR protein responds to oxidative-stress caused by superoxide and NO .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11407111" target="_blank">11407111</a>]<br></li>
<li>NO activates the SoxR protein by direct formation of a dinitrosyliron species , leading to the induction of the oxidative-stress response ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR is present in uninduced cells and its expression is not transcriptionally activated when cells are exposed to superaxide-generating agents such as paraquat ( Wu and Weiss .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previously , we found that a promoter , HC96 , is activated by paraquat and menadione independently of SoxR ( Lee and Roe , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15009899" target="_blank">15009899</a>]<br></li>
<li>SAL , salicylate ; Q , naphthoquinones ; PQ , paraquat ; SoxR * , activated SoxR protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8866468" target="_blank">8866468</a>]<br></li>
<li>How might wild-type SoxR be activated ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>Why is SoxR not constitutively activated by autooxidation in aerobically grown cells ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>Treatment with PQ to convert SoxR to the activated state had little effect on repression of soxR in strain VL20 ( Figure 2C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>In strains carrying these mutations , SoxR is in an activated state even in the absence of an inducer of the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>In light of this , it is understandable that the basal constitutive level of SoxS expression in the mutants re ¯ ects this partially oxidized ( activated ) state of SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , activated SoxR could exert transcriptional activation by the same sort of torsional mechanism as seen for activated MerR ( 2 ) , although the -35 to -10 spacing in the soxS promoter is only 18 bp ( 34 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>The mechanism for SoxR activation by the soxR4c mutation could include a shift in redox equilibrium to a more oxidized form or a conformational change to an active form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>Limited induction might be explained either by inefficient activation of SoxR by NO , or by instability of the activated form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10805777" target="_blank">10805777</a>]<br></li>
<li>The model for the oxidative activation of SoxR implies that constitutively activated mutant proteins might be constitutively oxidized .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>This finding , that constitutively activated mutant SoxR proteins are constitutively oxidized , provides further evidence for the oxidative mechanism of activation of the soxRS regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent work has shown that SoxR is activated when redox-cycling agents oxidize its Fe -- S cluster , leading to an activation of SoxS ( Gu & Imlay , 2011 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>

<li>As previously shown , the amount of soxS mRNA was strongly dependent on the presence of active FeSoxR ( Hidalgo and Demple , 1994 ; Figure 1B , lanes 4 -- 6 ) ; the smaller soxS activation by apo-SoxR depends on the topological state of the DNA template and has been explored in work to be reported elsewhere ( E.Hidalgo and B.Demple , in preparation ) .

Liu Dana Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA 02115 , USA Exposure to superoxide oxidizes the [ 2Fe-2S ] clusters , and activates SoxR as a positive transcriptional-regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18368388" target="_blank">18368388</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the cytoplasmic redox potential of E.coli has been estimated to be in the range of ± 260 to ± 280 mV ( Gilbert , 1990 ; Hwang et al. , 1995 ) , it is very likely that SoxR in vivo is actively maintained in the reduced state , implying the presence of a speci ® c reducing system for [ 2Fe ± 2S ] of SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR is a [ 2Fe-2S ] cluster containing transcriptional-regulators of the Mer family , and is activated in response to ROS generation during aerobic respiration , or from the reaction of redox-cycling compounds ( Greenberg and Dempl 1989 ; Greenberg et al. 1990 ; Tsaneva and Weiss 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25176444" target="_blank">25176444</a>]<br></li>
<li>Some recent experiments2 suggest that dithionite-reduced FeSoxR is still active as a transcription factor ( in contrast to DTT-treated Fe-SoxR ) , but the ease with which this protein is reoxidized by O2 in vitro indicates that caution should be applied in this interpretation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>The purification of SoxR and its protein use in in vitro transcription experiments may help to answer such questions and will also be critical to the identification of agents that switch the protein to an active form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent in vitro experiments ( Gaudu and Weiss , 1996 ; Ding et al. , 1996 ) show that reduction of SoxR reversibly inactivates the protein as a transcription factor , suggesting that oxidation activates SoxR in the cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>In nonactivated SoxR , these clusters are in the reduced state and their oxidation activates SoxR as a powerful transcription factor ( 12 , 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>This property of IscR was surprising since other known Fe -- S transcription factors ( e.g. , FNR , SoxR ) have only one type of site that either does ( FNR ) or does not ( SoxR ) require the Fe -- S cluster for DNA binding .8,9 The proposed Fe -- S ligands for IscR ( Cys92 , Cys98 , and Cys104 ) are distal to the predicted DNA-binding site ( Fig. 1 ) , and upon anaerobic isolation , the cluster is partially reduced ( [ 2Fe -- 2S ] 1 + - IscR ) but is readily oxidized in air to [ 2Fe -- 2S ] 2 + - IscR .1 Because IscR appears to require its Fe -- S cluster for regulation of PiscR and not for PsufA , this raises the question of whether IscR requires its [ 2Fe -- 2S ] cluster for regulation of other Type 2 promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19361432" target="_blank">19361432</a>]<br></li>
<li>FNR , another Fe -- S transcription factor in E. coli , only forms dimers and binds DNA in the presence of its oxygen-labile [ 4Fe-4S ] cluster .8,31 SoxR , a [ 2Fe -- 2S ] - containing transcription activator in the MerR family , can bind its single target DNA site in the presence or absence of its Fe -- S cluster .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19361432" target="_blank">19361432</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because SoxR binds independently of its [ 2Fe -- 2S ] cluster , it also represses transcription of its own promoter independently of its [ 2Fe -- 2S ] cluster .32 However , SoxR can only activate transcription from the divergent PsoxS when its [ 2Fe -- 2S ] cluster is present and oxidized .9 Although SoxR and IscR may be similar in their ability to function as trans-cription factors in the absence of their Fe -- S clusters , SoxR only binds a single DNA site , whereas IscR has multiple targets containing either the Type 1 site or the Type 2 site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19361432" target="_blank">19361432</a>]<br></li>
<li>When we used sodium dithionite , a strong reductant , to convert all the [ 2Fe ± 2S ] clusters in SoxR to the reduced form , the EPR signal from the wild-type sample did not change signi ® cantly , whereas those from mutant samples increased signi ® cantly ( Figure 6B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>Three SoxRc proteins contained [ 2Fe-2S ] centers required for in vitro transcription and , like wild-type SoxR , were inactivated by chemical reduction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the [ 2Fe-2S ] centers are required for transcriptional activity in the SoxRc proteins just as they are in wild-type SoxR ( Hidalgo and Demple , 1994 ; Hidalgo et al. , 1995 ; Ding and Demple , 1996 ; Hidalgo and Demple , 1996a ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since SoxR is activated in response to an intracellular redox signal ( Wu and Weiss , 1992 ; Nunoshiba et al. , 1992 ) , and the redox state of the wild-type SoxR [ 2Fe-2S ] centers regulates its in vitro transcriptional activity , we determined whether the constitutive activity of the SoxRc proteins was dependent on growth in oxygen .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>During normal growth , the SoxR [ 2Fe -- 2S ] centers are in the reduced state in vivo ; upon superoxide stress , the clusters are oxidized and the protein induces transcription of its only known target , the soxS gene ( Ding et al. , 1996 ; Gaudu and Weiss , 1996 ; Ding and Demple , 1997 ; Gaudu et al. , 1997 ; Hidalgo et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR contains redox-active [ 2Fe-2S ] clusters and mediates transcriptional activation of the soxS gene under oxidizing conditions , as has been demonstrated in vitro ( Hidalgo and Demple 1994 ; Hidalgo et al. 1995 ; Wu et al. 1995 ; Ding et al. 1996 ; Gaudu and Weiss 1996 ) as well as in vivo ( Gaudu et al. 1997 ; Hidalgo et al. 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10102373" target="_blank">10102373</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR in vitro can be reversibly inactivated by exposure to thiols such as 2-mercaptoethanol or glutathione ( Hidalgo and Demple , 1994 ; Ding and Demple , 1996 ) and reactivated by reassembly of the [ 2Fe-2S ] clusters ( Hidalgo and Demple , 1996a ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because SoxR activity can also be regulated by assembly and disassembly of the [ 2Fe-2S centers ( Ding and Demple , 1996 ; Hidalgo and Demple , 1996a ) , the apoprotein may constitute another inactive form in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>As found with SoxR , spinach dihydroxy-acid dehydratase contains a [ 2Fe-2S ] 2 + cluster that is also stable to the presence of superoxide ( 25 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14730984" target="_blank">14730984</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of elevated levels of superoxide , the SoxR [ 2Fe-2S ] clusters become oxidized ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11741843" target="_blank">11741843</a>]<br></li>
<li>Superoxide-generating agents , such as paraquat , trigger SoxR activity by causing one-electron oxidation to yield [ 2Fe-2S ] 21 clusters ; SoxR with reduced [ 2Fe-2S ] 11 centers is transcriptionally inactive ( 17 , 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10805777" target="_blank">10805777</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because [ 2Fe-2S ] centers mediate one-electron transfers , their presence in SoxR immediately suggested that they are the sensor elements for the soxRS superoxide response regulon and that their oxidation level is what regulates-the-activity .

<li>An Integrated Model for SoxR Regulation ( A ) During oxidative-stress , SoxR activity is positively affected by oxygen radicals to generate the transcriptionally active form with oxidized [ 2Fe-2S ] centers ( SoxR ( oxid ) ) ; this effect is countered by reduction to generate the inactive reduced form ( SoxR ( red ) ) .

<li>Rocentiy , Hidalgo and Demple ( 1994 ) showed that SoxR has an FeS cluster that is sensitive to the prevailing redox potential in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR contains a redox-sensitive Fe-S cluster that is required for sensing the signal O2̇ ¯ ( Hidalgo and Demple 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8588737" target="_blank">8588737</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR , isolated from bacteria that overproduce the protein , contains an FeS cluster ( s ) essential for in vitro transcriptional activation of the soxS promoter ( Hidalgo and Demple , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent studies revealed that SoxR protein contains binuclear iron-sulphur cluster ( s ) ( [ 2Fe-2S ] ) essential for in vitro transcriptional activation of the soxS promoter , and suggest that the FeS centre ( s ) of SoxR is involved in the signal-transductionmechanism that links superoxide stress to gene activation in the soxRS system ( Hidalgoand Demple , 1994 ; Wu etal .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8899708" target="_blank">8899708</a>]<br></li>
<li>Its function may therefore be fulfilled by SoxR , a protein having four closely spaced cysteines that might be involved in conformational changes accompanying induction and that might even be a redox center that detects superoxide .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1708380" target="_blank">1708380</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is interesting to note that NorR , Fur , SoxR , and OxyR all appear to contain redox-active cysteines and , in some cases , iron .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>If the cysteines of SoxR are metal ligands , they would likely bind other redox-active metals , such as iron or copper .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>The cysteines of SoxR could also constitute metal ligands , but which bind a redox-active metal such as iron .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , the only known homologs of SoxR , the MerR-family of gene regulators , employ a similar cluster of cysteines to bind Hg2 + and stimulate transcriptional activation by MerR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to the activation of DNA-binding observed in RclR , however , OxyR and SoxR bind to DNA in both their reduced and oxidized forms , with oxidation resulting in structural changes that lead to transcriptional activation ( 47 , 61 ) .

<li>We found that the reduction of SoxR did not affect its DNA-binding activity as much as it did its transcriptional-activity , even though the DNase protection assays ( Fig. 2 ) were performed under conditions similar to those of the initial steps of the transcriptional activation experiments ( Fig. 1 ) .

<li>The 17.1-kDa SoxR protein bears significant homology only to the MerR-family of proteins including a predicted DNA-binding helix-turn-helix and a cluster of cysteine residues positioned similarly to those that regulate the activity of MerR in response to Hg2 + .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>
<li>Most importantly , this homology includes two regions that are required for the function of the MerR protein of TnSOJ ( 25 ) : a probable helix-turn-helix at residues 12-34 in SoxR , and a cluster of cysteines at residues 122 , 124 and 130 in SoxR .

<li>The location of an activation center in this region of SoxR is supported by two separate lines of evidence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>The similar transcriptional-activity of the two forms suggests that they may have unexpectedly similar structures , but the structure of SoxR protein has not yet been determined .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10805777" target="_blank">10805777</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recently , Kobayashi and Tagawa ( 1999 ) reported that E.coli cells overproducing SoxR have SoxR-enhanced cytochrome c reductase activity in the presence of NADPH , and they isolated the responsible protein from the cytoplasm .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because NNR has no N-terminal cysteine residues or any other iron-liganding residues , NO-sensing must involve a different mechanism from the NO-medi-ated disassembly of a [ 4Fe-4S ] cluster or the nitrosylation of a [ 2Fe-2S ] cluster observed with CydR and SoxR , respectively ( Ding and Demple , 2000 ; Wu et al. , 2000 ) .

<li>Results SoxRc Proteins Require Oxidized [ 2Fe-2S ] Centers for In Vitro Activity Many SoxRc mutations cause deletions or alterations of the SoxR carboxy-terminal region just downstream of the cysteine cluster that anchors the [ 2Fe-2S ] centers to the protein ( Nunoshiba and Demple , 1994 ; Bradley et al. , submitted ) .

<li>[ 2Fe-2S ] cluster that is stable in the presence of O2 , while the [ 4Fe-4S ] cluster of the E. coli dehydratase is exquisitely sensi ¬ Although the metal centers of SoxR are clearly essential for the transcriptional-activity of the protein ( Hidalgo and Demple , 1994 ; this work ) , the mechanism that activates SoxR in vivo is unknown .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>Each SoxR monomer contains a [ 2Fe -- 2S ] cluster that can be reversibly oxidized ( Hidalgo and Demple 1994 ; Gaudu and Weiss 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18368388" target="_blank">18368388</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , we should note that SoxR is a homodimer containing one [ 2Fe -- 2S ] cluster per polypeptide chain , and we do not know if oxidation of the Fe -- S centers in the same dimer occurs cooperatively nor if the oxidation of both centers is needed for activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>For SoxR , a MerR homolog that uses an Fe-S cluster to sense oxidative stress ( 26 ) , the alignment suggests that the 2Fe-2S cluster will bind in a loop resembling the ZntR binuclear Zn2 site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12958362" target="_blank">12958362</a>]<br></li>
<li>As found with SoxR , spinach dihydroxy-acid dehydratase contains a [ 2Fe-2S ] 2 + cluster that is also stable to the presence of superoxide ( 25 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14730984" target="_blank">14730984</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the destabilization of the [ 2Fe-2S ] cluster of FNR with superoxide is not a general property of [ 2Fe-2S ] proteins since imposing a superoxide stress on SoxR results only in a change in cluster oxidation state ( from [ 2Fe-2S ] 1 + to [ 2Fe-2S ] 2 + ) , which converts SoxR into an active transcription factor ( 23 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14730984" target="_blank">14730984</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , it is also possible that the oxidation state of the cluster further modulates IscR function as has been found with the [ 2Fe-2S ] - containing transcription factor , SoxR ( 35 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11742080" target="_blank">11742080</a>]<br></li>
<li>For SoxR , the [ 2Fe ± 2S ] cluster is not required for initial folding , or for maintaining its structure or DNA-binding activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>FNR , another Fe -- S transcription factor in E. coli , only forms dimers and binds DNA in the presence of its oxygen-labile [ 4Fe-4S ] cluster .8,31 SoxR , a [ 2Fe -- 2S ] - containing transcription activator in the MerR-family , can bind its single target DNA site in the presence or absence of its Fe -- S cluster .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19361432" target="_blank">19361432</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR is a member of the MerR-family of metal-binding transcription factors , and it exists in solution as a homodimer , with each subunit containing a [ 2Fe-2S ] cluster .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>The purified protein is a homodi-mer containing two oxidized [ 2Fe-2S ] clusters ( Hidalgo et al. , 1995 ; Wu et al. , 1995 ) , apparently one in each protein monomer , with each center anchored by a cluster of four cysteine residues near the SoxR carboxyl terminus ( Bradley et al. , submitted ) .

<li>The [ 2Fe -- 2S ] 1 clusters in the reduced form of purified SoxR produce a characteristic EPR spectrum that disappears on oxidation ( 6 , 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the data are entirely consistent with the presence in ( SoxR ) 2 of two [ 2Fe-2S ] clusters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>It remains to be established whether the two SoxR [ 2Fe-2S ] clusters are arranged as one per subunit or as a pair of clusters coordinated between the subunits .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>Together with the iron determinations described above , these data indicate that ( SoxR ) 2 might contain either a single [ 4Fe-4S ] cluster or a pair of [ 2Fe-2S ] centers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>These features , together with quantitation of spin , iron , and S22 , and hydrodynamic evidence that SoxR is a homodimer in solution , indicate that ( SoxR ) 2 contains two [ 2Fe-2S ] clusters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , rather than having a pair of labile [ 4Fe-4S ] clusters , the homodimeric SoxR protein contains a pair of [ 2Fe-2S ] clusters that operate a direct redox-regulated switch .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11407111" target="_blank">11407111</a>]<br></li>
<li>DISCUSSION The studies presented here indicate that SoxR protein is a homodimer that , in its activated form , contains a pair of [ 2Fe-2S ] centers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>Three SoxRc proteins contained [ 2Fe-2S ] centers required for in vitro transcription and , like wild-type SoxR , were inactivated by chemical reduction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>We describe here experiments that define [ 2Fe-2S ] clusters in SoxR , and we show that only the metalloprotein activates in vitro transcription and is apparently associated with formation of the open complex at the soxS promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that the FeS cluster is Ihe sensor domain of SoxR and that the redox state of this domain determines the activation state of SoxR in the cell The roie of SoxS as the second regulatory agent of the superoxide regulon is a ( so based on a number of genetic observations .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>EPR spectroscopy has been used to analyze the redox state of the overproduced proteins containing an iron ± sulfur cluster in intact cells , since it can determine the unpaired electron of the Fe ± S cluster ( Johnson et al. , 1985 ) , and has been applied successfully to monitor the redox state of SoxR in vivo ( Ding and Demple , 1997 ; Gaudu et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>A direct activation of SoxR by NO to form a dinitrosyl-iron-dithiol cluster has been shown [ 179 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14638413" target="_blank">14638413</a>]<br></li>
<li>NO also has been shown to react directly with the 2Fe -- 2S centers of the E. coli SoxR dimer to generate a dinitrosyl -- iron -- dithiol form of SoxR ( 51 ) , and as described above , GSNO can react with the redox-active C199 residue in OxyR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR contains non-heme iron essential for abortive initiation of transcription in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7673113" target="_blank">7673113</a>]<br></li>
<li>The oxidative activation of SoxR is distinguished from another well-known Fe ± S-containing transcription factor Fnr , which contains a [ 4Fe ± 4S ] cluster .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR contains a redox-active Fe-S cluster that activates transcription in the oxidized form but not in the reduced form ( 48 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10608803" target="_blank">10608803</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the Fe ± S cluster serves as an elaborate redox-sensitive switch for SoxR activation to modulate soxS gene transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is known that these responses depend on select transcription factors ( e.g. OxyR , SoxR , PerR ) , which are able to specifically sense particular oxidants , often through the oxidation state of conserved cysteine residues .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24078635" target="_blank">24078635</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vivo , this oxidation may be caused by an alteration of the redox balance of electron chain intermediates that normally maintains SoxR in an inactive , reduced state .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our finding that the activity of SoxR depends on the oxidation state of its Fe-S clusters favors the hypothesis that these are indeed sensor elements .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>

<li>These and other considerations led to the hypothesis that a two-stage system controls the soxRS regulon ( 7 ) : a cellular redox signal ( not necessarily superoxide itself ) activates preexisting SoxR protein , which then triggers expression of the soxS gene , and the elevated level of SoxS protein induces the various genes of the regulon .

<li>The weaker repression exerted by the SoxRc proteins compared to that of wild-type SoxR was probably due to lower expression of the mutant proteins ( z30 % of the amount of wild-type SoxR expressed from the same vector , as determined by immunoblotting ; data not shown ) .

<li>Mutations mapped to two loci : the rsxABCDGE operon ( named for reducer of SoxR ) that is highly homologous to the rnfABCDGE operon in Rhodobacter capsulatus involved in transferring electrons to nitrogenase , and the rseC gene in the rpoE ± rseABC operon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>The double mutation of rsx and rseC suggested that rsxABCDGE and rseC gene products act together in the same pathway in reducing SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>YjiE differs from OxyR and SoxR as it does not regulate genes that are apparently involved in the degradation of ROS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22223481" target="_blank">22223481</a>]<br></li>
<li>DISCUSSION The DNA sequence ( Fig. 1 ) confirms earlier work on the proteins specified by intact and mutant sox plasmids ( 46 ) that indicated that the sox region contains divergently transcribed genes encoding a 17-kDa SoxR protein and a 13-kDa protein that is now designated as SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1708380" target="_blank">1708380</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA transcription is controlled by the repressor function of MarR ( encoded within the marRAB operon ; Cohen et al. , 1993 ) , whereas SoxS transcription depends on its activation by SoxR ( encoded within the soxRS region ; Amabile-Cuevas & Demple , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR is present in uninduced cells and its expression is not transcriptionally activated when cells are exposed to superaxide-generating agents such as paraquat ( Wu and Weiss .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>Why is SoxR not constitutively activated by autooxidation in aerobically grown cells ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since strain XA90 carries the laclqlgene , expression of SoxR from the pKOXR construct could be induced by isopropyl-o-D-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>This induction is mediated by the SoxR protein , since it is abolished in a DsoxR mutant and induced in a soxR * strain even without the presence of paraquat .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592392" target="_blank">7592392</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of Rsx and RseC proteins , a back-up system may operate to reduce SoxR , as hinted at by the slow return of the elevated soxS mRNA to the uninduced level in the rsx and rseC mutants .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression level of hcaR was also measured in soxR and oxyR mutants because SoxR [ 5 ] and OxyR [ 31 ] regulators modulate expression of many genes including sodA , gor , katG , ahpC and ahpF .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15808934" target="_blank">15808934</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of acnA ( aconitase A ) is also activated by SoxR alone when under iron deprivation , but not of sodA ( Mn-superoxide-dismutase ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11470373" target="_blank">11470373</a>]<br></li>
<li>The DJ901-derived strains were transformed with the SoxR expression vector pSXR , the SoxS expression vector pSXS and the control vector pSE380 ( Amábile - Cuevas and Demple , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>For the independent expression of SoxR and SoxS , plasmids pSXR and pSXS were transformed into strain DJ901 ( AsoxR ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR and SoxS , which modulate the response to superoxide-gener-ating compounds , activate the expression of a transcript encoding both ﬂavodoxin and Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10419964" target="_blank">10419964</a>]<br></li>
<li>The SoxR and SoxS proteins constitute a sensor-regulator system that senses superoxide and modulates gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18368388" target="_blank">18368388</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , these experiments indicated that superoxide may trigger SoxR protein to activate soxS expression and that enough superoxide to give modest activation of SoxR may be formed even in poorly aerated cells lacking SOD .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>Treatment with superoxide-generating compounds , such as paraquat , activates SoxR , which , in turn , transcriptionally activates the expression of soxS ( 5 , 10 , 31 , 46 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097628" target="_blank">21097628</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , despite the increased abundance of the soxS transcript , presumably reflecting an increased production of superoxide under aerobic conditions that is sensed by SoxR ( 43 ) , the level of SoxS remains below the threshold required to trigger expression of the SoxS regulon .

<li>SoxS is evidently the proximal activator of the regulon genes : antibiotic resistance and high-level expression of at least three of the regulon proteins was effected in vivo by the individual expression of SoxS , but not of SoxR , whether or not the cells were exposed to paraquat .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>
<li>Individual expression of the SoxS protein in the absence of SoxR switched on the micF , sod4 , zwf , and nfo genes ( and presumably the entire soxRS regulon ) , whether or not the cells were exposed to PQ ( 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>Apparently , when deprived of iron , SoxR can induce by itself the expression of some of the genes of the soxRS regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11470373" target="_blank">11470373</a>]<br></li>
<li>absence of SoxR ( or of any superoxide-generating agent ) was sufficient to induce strong expression of at least three soxRS regulon genes ( Table 2 ; Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR ( pl = 9.4 ) and SoxS ( pl = 10.7 ) are both basic proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1708380" target="_blank">1708380</a>]<br></li>
<li>When SoxR is activated by oxidation of its [ 2Fe ± 2S ] cluster , it increases the synthesis of SoxS , which then activates its target gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>In light of this , it is understandable that the basal constitutive level of SoxS expression in the mutants re ¯ ects this partially oxidized ( activated ) state of SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although MarA homologue SoxS was also shown to regulate the transcription of acrAB strongly ( Ma et al. , 1996 ; White et al. , 1997 ) , SoxS , also a small protein of 107 residues , exerts its action by altering the level of its own expression , which is regulated via SoxR by oxidizing agents that generate the superoxide radical ( Greenberg et al. , 1990 ; Ding et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Oxidized SoxR then induces the expression of the second transcription factor SoxS , which directly activates the transcription of sodA ( manganese superoxide dismutase ) , fpr ( ferredoxin / ﬂavodoxinNADP1 reductase ) , zwf ( glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ) , fumC ( fumarase C ) , nfo ( endonuclease IV ) , acnA ( aconitase A ) , and micF ( a regulatory RNA ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10419964" target="_blank">10419964</a>]<br></li>
<li>For cells expressing high levels of SoxR , neither the extent of soxS promoter binding ( data not shown ) nor the extent of the SoxR footprint ( Fig. 6 , lane 3 ) was altered by this treatment .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under condition of excess superoxide generation , all SoxR will be converted into the completely oxidized state , and thus it makes sense that paraquat treatment further increases the soxS expression in the mutant to the maximum level comparable with the full induction level in the wild-type ( Figures 3 and 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>As seen in Figure 2C , wildtype levels of SoxR repressed expression of the soxR promoter by ~ 20-fold .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>As a control for expression of the SoxR proteins , under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions , we used the compound diamide , which gives modest induction of soxS independent of oxygen ( Privalle et al. , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>As seen in Figure 4A , aerobic soxS expression was induced by diamide in strain TN5311-pSXR ( wild-type SoxR ) but was expressed at constitutively high levels in the presence of the SoxRc proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>In a ﬁrst attempt to conﬁrm whether SoxR represses transcription of its own gene in vivo , we fused a 0.35 kb DNA fragment of the soxRS locus to the lacZ reporter gene ( see Materials and methods ; Figure 2A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR autorepression is a feature shared with many prokaryotic transcriptional activators that repress transcription of their own genes ( Gralla and Collado-Vides , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>

<li>Like SoxR0x , the SoxR apoprotein ( lacking Fe-S centers ) is also able to bind to the soxS operator and to exist as a dimer , although it is not transcriptionally active ( 12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>

<li>While both the oxidized and reduced forms of SoxR bind equally well to the promoter sequence of soxS , only the oxidized form activates transcription of soxS , presumably by enhancing open-complex formation by RNA polymerase ( 12 ) .

<li>SoxR protein is a member of the MerR family of proteins , which activate transcription of the mer operon in response to Hg2 + .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8899708" target="_blank">8899708</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whereas the effect on Fur and FNR caused transcription alterations in the genes under their control , that of SoxR was unexpected ; although a large increase upon the transcription of soxS occurred , a corresponding increase on the SoxRS regulon could not be detected .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15546870" target="_blank">15546870</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upregulation of these genes occurs in a two-step process in which the SoxR protein acts both as a sensory protein to detect elevated levels of superoxide within the cell and as a positive regulator of soxS transcription ( 2 , 15 , 16 , 53 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11741843" target="_blank">11741843</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previous work from other laboratories has Indicated that SoxR is the sensor of oxi-dative stress and induces synthesis of SoxS , which in turn activates transcription of the regulon 's target genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>Oxidized SoxR then induces the expression of a second transcription factor , SoxS , which in turn activates the transcription of a set of genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11073934" target="_blank">11073934</a>]<br></li>
<li>When oxidized , SoxR activates the transcription of soxS , and the resulting SoxS protein activates genes that collectively help to avoid or repair the damage caused by oxidants ( 13 , 18 , 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>When these centers are oxidized , SoxR becomes a transcriptional activator of soxS , and the newly synthesized SoxS protein ( itself a transcriptional activator ) then induces other genes of the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10714981" target="_blank">10714981</a>]<br></li>
<li>As SoxR , the transcription factor that activates soxS under superoxide stress , is an Fe-S protein , this small change in soxS expression may reﬂect an indirect effect on SoxR function .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16677314" target="_blank">16677314</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon activation , SoxR induces expression of the soxS gene in response to superoxide-generating agents , and then SoxS activates transcription of genes within the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16760308" target="_blank">16760308</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although Rob , SoxS and MarA activate micF transcription in response to different environmental stimuli , there is some overlap in response .14 soxS is part of the soxRS regulon .66 SoxR is a sensor protein activated by oxidative stress and in turn it transcriptionally activates soxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11601842" target="_blank">11601842</a>]<br></li>
<li>Induction occurs in a two-step cascade : ( i ) SoxR protein that is activated by oxidative stress induces the transcription of soxS and ( ii ) SoxS protein then activates the transcription of other genes ( 5 , 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Fe-containing SoxRc proteins displayed the same ability as wild-type Fe-SoxR to activate transcription of the soxS gene in vitro ( Figure 2B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>As for wild-type SoxR , the apo-SoxRc proteins were unable to activate transcription from the soxS promoter in vitro ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9019397" target="_blank">9019397</a>]<br></li>
<li>( B ) In the absence of a functional SoxR , soxS transcription remains low even under inducing conditions , whereas soxR transcription is constitutively de-repressed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is also important to determine why non-activated SoxR does not repress transcription of soxS , even though the protein occupies a site more typical of repressors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>( A ) Under inducing conditions , only activated SoxR triggers transcription of soxS ; both active and inactive SoxR bind to its DNA site ( white box ) and strongly repress transcription of the soxR gene .

<li>Transcription from the soxR promoter may also diminish soxS transcription further when SoxR is not activated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>

<li>The functional soxR promoter depresses transcription when SoxR is not activated soxS and enhances soxS transcription when SoxR is activated , as shown by comparing the expression of soxS : : lacZ fusions with and without the soxR -- 35 9 element ( induction ratio only ~ 7-fold ) .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>There is strong evidence that the SoxR protein , which is the sensor of the soxRS regulon ( 4 , 9 , 10 ) , occurs in oxidized and reduced forms and that the oxidized form is the activator of soxS transcription ( 11 -- 14 ) .

<li>During normal growth , the SoxR [ 2Fe -- 2S ] centers are in the reduced state in vivo ; upon superoxide stress , the clusters are oxidized and the protein induces transcription of its only known target , the soxS gene ( Ding et al. , 1996 ; Gaudu and Weiss , 1996 ; Ding and Demple , 1997 ; Gaudu et al. , 1997 ; Hidalgo et al. , 1997 ) .

<li>When the [ 2Fe ± 2S ] center of SoxR is in the fully oxidized state ( Fe3 + ± Fe3 + ) , SoxR can activate the transcription of its only known target gene soxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR serves as a sensor for superoxide and nitric oxide through its [ 2Fe-2S ] center and activates soxS transcription when oxidized .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19376854" target="_blank">19376854</a>]<br></li>

<li>The soxS gene encoding the proximal inducer of the individual regulon genes is expressed at only a low level in the absence of the stress ( Wu and Weiss , 1992 ; Elena Hidalgo , Veronica Leautaud and Bruce Demple1 Department of Cancer Cell Biology , Harvard School of Public Health , Boston , MA 02115-6021 , USA 1Corresponding author e-mail : demple@mbcrr.harvard.edu The SoxR protein of Escherichia coli responds to redox signals by activating the transcription of soxS , which encodes another transcription activator that directly stimulates oxidative stress genes .

<li>Regulation of the acnA and fum gene expression by SoxRS The soxRS oxidative stress regulon responds to superoxide-generating agents such as methyl viologen , by a two-stage process in which the SoxR protein is thought to serve as a redox-sensing activator of the adjacent so.xS gene , followed in turn by the activation of regulon genes bv the SoxS protein ( Amabile-Cuevas & Demple , 1991 ; Hildago & Demple , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results support the hypothesis of two-stage regulation ( 7 ) , in which the redox-activated SoxR protein binds the soxS promoter to activate transcription and the elevated levels of SoxS protein induce the various soxRS regulon genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>These and other considerations led to the hypothesis that a two-stage system controls the soxRS regulon ( 7 ) : a cellular redox signal ( not necessarily superoxide itself ) activates preexisting SoxR protein , which then triggers expression of the soxS gene , and the elevated level of SoxS protein induces the various genes of the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>The soxRS regulon is controlled by a two-stage system in which the SoxR protein is a redox-sensing transcriptional activator of the soxS gene , whose product subsequently activates the various soxRS regulon genes ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8226698" target="_blank">8226698</a>]<br></li>
<li>A two-stage control system was hypothesized for soxRS , in which an intracellular redox signal would trigger the SoxR protein as a transcriptional activator of the soxS gene and the resulting increased levels of SoxS protein would activate transcription of the various soxRS regulon genes ( B. Demple and C. F. Amaibile Cuevas , Cell 67:837 -839 , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>Comparing the expression of the soxR9 : : lacZ reporter inserted in strains VL20 and EH200 demonstrated auto-regulation by SoxR , but did not address the location of the soxR transcriptional start site because that fusion contained the entire upstream region well into the soxS gene ( Figure 2A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>NO also induces SoxR-mediated expression of several genes involved in oxidative stress responses ( 35 ) , but NO induction of F ( hmp-lacZ ) 1 expression was largely independent of SoxR ( Table 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8808940" target="_blank">8808940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , SoxR mediates an approximately fourfold induction of oxidative response gene expression ( at 200 ml of NO gas per 2 ml of culture ; 35 ) , whereas F ( hmp-lacZ ) 1 expression was induced approximately 20-fold by only 20 mM NO in solution ( Table 5 ) .
