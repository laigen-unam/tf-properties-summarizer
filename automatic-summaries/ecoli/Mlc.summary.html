<li>It is noteworthy that the guanidino group of Arg-424 in EIIB , which was previously identified as a critical residue in binding to Mlc ( 21 ) , is located in the vicinity of the carbonyl oxygen of Leu-146 and the C-terminal carboxylate ¶ in Mlc , indicating multiple polar interactions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>In EIIB complexed with Mlc the side chain chi-angles of Arg-424 are 58.5 ° , 171.3 ° , 59.4 ° , 176.2 ° , and 180 ° , whereas those of Arg-424 in S-EIIB are 67.3 ° , 73 ° , 177.7 ° , 61.3 ° , and 179.6 ° , indicating that the side chain of Arg-424 in S-EIIB should undergo considerable torsional changes to assume the same side chain conformation as that of Arg-424 in EIIB complexed with Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the fixed side chain of Arg-424 to the phosphate moiety in P-EIIB could not protrude toward Mlc , which would prevent the formation of intermolecular interactions between Arg-424 of EIIB and Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>In conclusion , both the loss of critical intermolecular interactions mediated by Arg-424 and steric hindrance , which are instigated by the phosphorylation of EIIB , trigger the dissociation Glc of Mlc from pEIICB in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consequently , it was demonstrated that EIIBGlc could repress Mlc activity only if it was attached either to the membrane by the EIICGlc domain or to a heterologous membrane anchor ( e.g. , the Gp8 protein , the bacteriophage M13 major coat protein [ 39 ] , or the lactose permease LacY [ 44 ] ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>The localization of EIIBGlc at the membrane appears to be essential for this kind of inactivation mechanism ( 27 ) , since overproduction of the liberated soluble EIIBGlc domain does not lead to Mlc inactivation ( 13 , 34 ) , although unphosphorylated EIIBGlc alone binds to Mlc , as shown in surface plasmon resonance assays ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>5250 500 6 7 PHO 8 5 4 ' - r 200 0.1 110O0 4 ~ ~ L 7 6 5 8 ¬ PHO experiments showed that mafT transcription is in - vivo recombination , into the plasmid-borne ( ma1T ' - creased in the absence of Mlc compared to the wild-type lacZ + ) 1 operon fusion to produce the ( malTpl strain but is still pH,-regulated ( Fig. 3a ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>Cells overexpressing Mlc showed a very slow fermentation rate compared with the wild type when grown in the presence of various phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransferase system sugars but few differences in the presence of non-phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate phosphotransferase system sugars except maltose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , after the immobilized EIIB domain was phosphorylated by ¯ owing the mixture of EI , HPr and EIIAGlc in the presence of PEP , and subsequently washed with the running buffer , interaction of Mlc was hardly detectable ( center sensorgram ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the second sensorgram , Mlc was injected after the immobilized EIIB surface had been phosphorylated by ¯ owing the Glc mixture of EI , HPr and EIIA in the presence of PEP , and ¯ ushed with the running buffer to remove PEP and other PTS proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>More recently , it was also discovered that the membrane-bound glucose transporter enzyme IICBGlc interacts with Mlc to modulate the cellular localization and activity of the global repressor protein Mlc in a phosphorylation state-dependent manner ( 12 , 24 , 25 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15169777" target="_blank">15169777</a>]<br></li>
<li>A unique feature of induction of the Mlc regulon by glucose is that the effector-molecule modulating Mlc activity is a membrane-bound protein , EIICBGlc ( 7 , 15 , 16 ) , in which cytosolic EIIB protein is attached to membrane-embedded EIIC protein through a linker of 20 aa .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , we considered the protein ± protein interaction as a reasonable mechanism for glucose induction of the Mlc regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc -- IIBGlc Edited by Winfried Boos , University of Konstanz , Konstanz , Germany , and ac September 30 , 2007 ) In Escherichia coli , glucose-dependent transcriptional induction of genes encoding a variety of sugar-metabolizing enzymes and transport systems is mediated by the phosphorylation state-dependent interaction of membrane-bound enzyme IICBGlc ( EIICBGlc ) with the global repressor Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here , we present the ® rst evidence for the involvement of membrane-bound EIICBGlc in the regulation of expression of several genes , by direct interaction with the global repressor Mlc in a phosphorylation state-dependent manner in E.coli ; this is illustrated by the model in Figure 6 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>It should be noted , however , that EIICBGlc-enriched membrane vesicles prepared from GI698DptsHIcrr interacted with Mlc even in the absence of glucose , implying that the direct regulator for the Mlc ± EIICBGlc interaction is not glucose but the phosphorylation state of EIICBGlc ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this report , we demonstrated that glucose induction is mediated by the direct interaction between the membrane-bound Glc glucose transporter EIICB and Mlc , in a manner dependent on the phosphorylation state of EIICBGlc in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>We provide experimental evidence showing that glucose induction is mediated through the direct physical interaction between Mlc and EIICBGlc , dependent on the phosphorylation state of EIICBGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>A model showing that glucose induction is mediated by the direct interaction between Mlc and EIICBGlc in a phosphorylation state-dependent manner .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results imply that dephosphorylated EIICBGlc in the membrane , but not the soluble PTS proteins , may act as a positive regulator of the Mlc regulon , possibly by neutralizing Mlc activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since all PTS and several non-PTS sugars can also lower the phosphorylation state of the PTS proteins ( Postma et al. , 1993 ; Hogema et al. , 1998 ) , these sugars might also enhance the interaction between EIICBGlc and Mlc to induce expression of the PTS proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been shown that the unphosphorylated EIICBGlc can sequester Mlc from its binding sites by direct protein-protein interaction to induce expression of the Mlc regulon in response to glucose ( 9 -- 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>Subsequently , it was demonstrated that the unphosphorylated form of EIICBGlc can relieve the repression of the Mlc regulon by sequestering Mlc through the direct protein-protein interaction to induce the expression of the Mlc regulon including PTS proteins ( 19 -- 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>The dephos-pho-form of EIICBGlc , resulting from the presence of glucose , can relieve the repression of the Mlc regulon by sequestering Mlc through a direct protein-protein interaction to induce expression of the Mlc regulon including the carbohydrate PTS proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16164569" target="_blank">16164569</a>]<br></li>
<li>As the amount of added EIICBGlc increased , that of Mlc in the soluble fractions decreased , while the level of the added soluble PTS proteins remained constant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The dissociation constant ( Kd ) was calculated by plotting the amount of bound Mlc , obtained by subtracting unbound from added Mlc , versus added EIICBGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>In future studies we will investigate whether Mlc overproduction negatively affects the function of EIICBGlc or whether it might affect the sgrS promoter by direct repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17209026" target="_blank">17209026</a>]<br></li>
<li>This mechanism ensures that sequestration of Mlc by unphosphorylated EIICBGlc can not be compensated for by an increase in Mlc synthesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc affects activation of sgrS by an undeﬁned mechanism .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17209026" target="_blank">17209026</a>]<br></li>
<li>Binding af ® nity of Mlc with EIICBGlc and its target promoters To determine the strength of the EIICBGlc ± Mlc interaction , we incubated Mlc with various concentrations of EIICBGlc in the form of membrane vesicles .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , we explored the interaction between Mlc and EIICBGlc in the form of membrane vesicles .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Direct interaction between the dephospho-form of EIICBGlc and Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Direct interaction between Mlc and EIICBGlc We then examined whether puri ® ed Mlc interacts directly with the puri ® ed PTS components , EI , HPr and EIIAGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>These strains lack the potential interaction partners Mlc , EIICBGlc , EIIXYZMan , and EI-HPr-EIIAGlc , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>For detection of EIIAGlc , EIICBGlc , and Mlc polyclonal anti-EIIAGlc , anti-EIIBGlc , anti-EI , and anti-Mlc antibodies were used as described previously ( 43 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , there must be a fundamental difference in the mode of action between YeeI and EIICBGlc during inactivation of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Samples were taken and analyzed in parallel by Western blot analysis to determine the amounts of YeeI-His5 , EIICBGlc , Mlc , and EIIAGlc ( Fig. 3A to D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Effects of different amounts of YeeI on the quantities of EIICBGlc , Mlc , and EIIAGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data suggest that even though Mlc overproduction does reduce levels of EIICBGlc protein , this effect does not account for the phenotype of reduction of PsgrS-lacZ activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17209026" target="_blank">17209026</a>]<br></li>
<li>Third , overexpression of yeeI caused in vivo titration of Mlc even in the absence of EIICBGlc , the only other protein interaction partner of this repressor known thus far .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>YeeI overproduction leads to titration of Mlc , even in the absence of EIICBGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to these results , we obtained strong evidence that YeeI is not an integral membrane protein but is nevertheless capable of inactivating Mlc directly in the cytosol , even in the absence of EIICBGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>To clarify the mechanism for induction of Mlc-regulated genes by EIICBGlc overproduction , as shown in Figure 1 and in previous reports ( De Reuse and Danchin , 1991 ; Plumbridge , 1999 ) , direct interaction between Mlc and PTS proteins was measured using puri ® ed Mlc , EI , HPr , EIIAGlc and EIIBGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Determination of the direct interaction between EIICBGlc and Mlc Incubation mixtures contained 100 mM Tris ± HCl pH 7.5 , 2 mM DTT , 2 mM MgCl2 , three soluble PTS proteins ( 5 mg of EI , 15 mg of HPr , 15 mg of EIIAGlc ) and 10 mg of Mlc , with the indicated amounts of membrane vesicles in a total volume of 100 ml .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , when glucose was added to the reaction mixture containing EIICBGlc-enriched membrane vesicles , Mlc was completely co-precipitated with the membrane vesicles and no Mlc was detected in the supernatant ( compare lanes for supernatants in Figure 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Membrane vesicles ( 350 mg ) in which EIICBGlc is enriched ( lanes labeled EIICBGlc ) or EIICBGlc is lacking ( lanes labeled ± EIICBGlc ) were mixed with Mlc and three soluble PTS proteins ( EI , HPr and EIIAGlc ) in the presence of 2 mM PEP or 2 mM glucose ( Glc ) , as indicated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Following incubation of Mlc ( 100 mg/ml ) with the indicated concentrations of membrane-bound Glc Glc EIICB in the presence of EI , HPr , EIIA and 2 mM glucose , the reaction mixtures were centrifuged to separate Mlc bound to EIICBGlc in membrane vesicles .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>To measure the binding af ® nity of the interaction , Mlc was incubated with various concentrations of membrane-bound EIICBGlc with 2 mM glucose in the presence of EI , HPr and EIIAGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Instead , the conformational freedom of Mlc would be considerably confined by the oligomeric state of EIIB-fused proteins that bind Mlc because Mlc anchored to the membrane is structurally restricted .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylation state-dependent interaction between EIIB and Mlc Real-time interactions of Mlc with the EIIB domain and other soluble PTS proteins were monitored by SPR detection under different conditions using a BIAcore 2000 ( Pharmacia Biosensor AB , Uppsala , Sweden ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>( C ) Phosphorylation state-dependent interaction between EIIB and Mlc measured by changes in SPR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The chimeric EIIB proteins can be phosphorylated by the PTS and show the phosphorylation state-dependent interaction with Mlc ( SI Fig. 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The soluble EIIB domain is suf ® cient for the phosphorylation state-dependent interaction with Mlc Since the interaction between Mlc and EIICBGlc was only dependent on the phosphorylation state of EIICBGlc , we tested the possibility that the isolated EIIB domain is suf ® cient for the interaction with Mlc in a phosphorylation state-dependent manner .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the Mlc protein was exposed to surfaces immobilized with the V449Q and Q456A mutants of EIIB , however , interaction was hardly detectable ( Fig. 2C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>When puri ® ed Mlc was exposed to immobilized EIIB , high af ® nity interaction was detected ( Figure 3C , left sensorgram ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>When puriﬁed Mlc was exposed to immobilized YeeI , a high afﬁnity interaction was detected ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>YeeI binds to Mlc in surface plasmon resonance experiments .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>To obtain proof that there is a direct interaction between YeeI and Mlc , SPR experiments with puriﬁed proteins were performed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data indicate that the strength of the interaction between YeeI and Mlc , as measured in this work , is in a physiologically relevant range .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Then we estimated the amount of free Mlc , remaining soluble after pelleting membrane vesicles and proteins bound to them , by densitometric quanti ® cation of the Mlc bands in SDS ± PAGE ( Figure 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Instead of acting as an inducer for Mlc , this repressor is inactivated by sequestration to unphosphorylated ( and actively transporting ) membrane-bound PtsG ( 34 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16321936" target="_blank">16321936</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alternatively , some regulatory proteins , such as Mlc ( 30 , 51 ) , can be found in an active-conformation in the cytoplasm and can be temporarily inactivated by sequestration to the inner membrane .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16513732" target="_blank">16513732</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , the existence of the long linker between cytosolic EIIB and membrane-embedded EIIC and the absence of direct interaction between Mlc and EIIC indicate that EIIB-bound Mlc is located some distance away from membrane .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , Mlc can also be inactivated by the cytoplasmic protein MtfA in a direct protein-protein interaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>The direct interaction between hydrophobic membrane and soluble Mlc is not energetically favorable .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>An inactivation model of Mlc has been proposed in which the direct interaction of the membrane-localized Mlc with membrane may induce the dimerization of Mlc ( 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Analyses of Mlc-IIBGlc interaction and a plausible molecular mechanism of Mlc inactivation by membrane sequestration .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to this model , the structural restriction generated by the anchoring of Mlc to the membrane is the key determinant for Mlc inactivation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this case membrane sequestration might not be necessary for inactivation of Mlc by YeeI .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to EIIBGlc , inactivation of Mlc by MtfA occurs in the cytosol and is not membrane dependent ( 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Neither SR752 nor SR753 expressed enough Mlc detectable by Western blotting , suggesting that the mutations in these strains were not enough to increase the intracellular concentration of Mlc detectible by Western blotting .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>Various methods as suggested by Rudolph and Lilie ( 21 ) were tried to increase the solubility of Mlc in the cell extract , and we found that Mlc was soluble in glycine-NaOH buffer , pH 9.5 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , as illustrated in Fig. 5c and d , puriﬁed MtfAE150D or MtfAE150Q proteins are still capable of causing a release of the ptsGop fragment in a band-shift assay with puriﬁed Mlc in vitro .

<li>Activation of ptsG P1 transcription by heat-shock was also seen in the Dmlc strain ( Fig. 5A , lane 7 ) , suggesting the possibility that Mlc was not involved in the activation of P1 by heat-shock .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previous studies have indicated that the ptsG promoter , which contains a CRP activation site ( see Table 2 ) ( 36 ) , is both activated by CRP and strongly repressed by the pleiotropic transcriptional-repressor Mlc .

<li>Moreover , both the ptsH P0 promoter and the ptsG P1 promoter have been shown to be subject to activation by the cAMP CRP complex and repression by Mlc ( 13 -- 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that activation of ptsG P1 by heat-shock was not mediated by Mlc or CRP cAMP even though Mlc repression z might be dominant over activation of ptsG P1 by heat-shock .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results are consistent with those of in vitro transcription assay , indicating that Mlc negatively regulates P0 transcription by preventing open complex formation at P0 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>

<li>Half repression by the recombinant Mlc , in the absence and presence of CRPzcAMP , was obtainable with about 6 and 12 ng ( Fig. 4B ) , respectively , showing that the stimulatory effect of the CRPzcAMP complex on P0 in the presence of Mlc was not significant , and Mlc is a stronger regulator .

<li>Comparison of the levels of protection by cAMP/CAP in the presence and in the absence of Mlc suggests that Mlc binding enhances cAMP/CAP binding ( Fig. 5 , compare lanes 6 and 7 with 8 and 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of Mlc , the RNAP binding to P0 is inhibited while the RNAP binding to P1 is only slightly reduced by Mlc ( Fig. 8 , lane 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fig. 5 showed that Mlc bound to the P0 promoter region , and the binding of both Mlc and CRPzcAMP to the P0 promoter region was independent of each other ( compare lanes 2 , 3 , and 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>DNase I footprinting results also showed that the binding of RNA polymerase to the P0 promoter region was inhibited in the presence of Mlc ( compare lanes 2 , 4 , and 5 in Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>We found that the transcription from P0 but not from P1 was strongly inhibited when increasing amounts of Mlc were added ( Fig. 6 , lanes 2 -- 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>When increasing amounts of Mlc were added , the Mlc -- DNA complex was clearly formed ( Fig. 7 , lanes 1 -- 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>When Mlc binds to the two operators , it also alters the cleavage pattern of the intervening DNA but not to the same extent as NagC ( Fig. 3A and B , lanes 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>There is , however , no such dramatic distortion of the ptsG regulatory region footprint when Mlc binds , but some changes in the intensity of bands in the intervening DNA are discernible when both Mlc and CAP bind ( Fig. 7 , lanes 4 -- 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , Mlc can bind quite efficiently to the nagE single-site fusion producing a level of repression only 2-fold lower than for the nagBE -- lac fusion ( 28 - and 56-fold , respectively ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>However the much stronger repression of this fusion by overproduced Mlc , compared with overproduced NagC , shows that the isolated nagE operator site has a higher affinity for Mlc than NagC .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>For the single-site nagE -- lacZ fusion the NagC plasmid is surprisingly inefficient at repressing ( < 3-fold repression ) while the Mlc plasmid is 10 times better ( 28-fold repression ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>As expected , the NagC plasmid is more efficient than the Mlc plasmid for the nagE -- lacZ s.o. fusion ( nearly 100-fold for NagC compared with just 8-fold repression by Mlc ) , which is consistent with the -- 11G , +11 C s.o. mutation creating a better NagC site and a worse Mlc site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Assuming an enrichment of NagC or Mlc to ~ 2.5 % of the total protein in the extracts , the amount of NagC or Mlc mixed with the 15 pmol of labelled template was ~ 250 ng .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , these observations imply that the manX operator is only partially occupied under physiological concentrations of the Mlc protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Puriﬁed Mlc protein and anti-Mlc mouse antibody were kindly provided by Dr. Youngjae Seok .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I thank Annie Kolb for many helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript and Mitchel Lewis and Winfried Boos for the gifts of purified NagC and Mlc , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>NagC bound to the NagC selected sites ( C5 , C9 and C42 ) at least 100-fold better than to the Mlc sites ( M1 , M26 ) and at least 10 times better than to M3 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc bound at least 10-fold better to its sites than to C sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is not just due to the presence of G/C at positions +11 / -- 11 in all the NagC selected sequences , since the Mlc selected sequence M134 , which has -- 11C , +11 G , produces a 2-fold derepression of ptsG -- lacZ and M11 , with +11 G , produces a 6-fold derepression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Despite the presence of -- 11C , +11 G , it was selected as an Mlc site and binds Mlc almost as well as the other M sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>For both Mlc and NagC sites the affinities in vivo seem to increase with the presence of more bases in the CGCG configuration in positions -- 4 to +4 ( shown in pink in Fig. 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>This amino acid is Gln in NagC and Glu in Mlc ( Fig. 1A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>However mutagenesis experiments exchanging the Gln to Glu in NagC , and vice versa in Mlc , gave no indication of a specificity change ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The last compound is the inducer for NagC ( Plum-bridge , 1991 ) , the repressor of the nagE -- BACD operons and a homologue of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nagE operator does exhibit a higher affinity for Mlc than NagC , but no regulation of nagE by physiological concentrations of Mlc was detected in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The implications of this experiment were that the nagE operator , the part of the divergent nagE-B operon system that is known to be controlled by NagC , appeared to have the characteristics of a Mlc operator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The binding sites for Mlc , CRP-cAMP , and FruR are shown by black , hatched , and open boxes , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>The relative occupancy of each operator by Mlc or NagC was calculated by comparing the intensity of three bands within each operator in the presence of NagC or Mlc with that in their absence ( Fig. 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The relative concentrations of Mlc and NagC are shown at the top of each lane .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The introduction of the mlc mutation does seem to provoke a small increase ( 1.3-fold ) , which could be explained by some weak Mlc binding in the absence of NagC .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Mlc protein binds to the NagC operators , binding preferentially to the promoter-proximal operator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>The site at which Mlc binds shows homology to the previously identiﬁed NagC operators ( Plumbridge and Kolb , 1995 ) , but no NagC binding to it was detected ( Fig. 1 , lane 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>The presence of -- 11C / +11 G can explain the good NagC binding but the strong binding to Mlc , despite there being a C/G at +11 / -- 11 , must reflect another affinity factor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The relative derepression caused by each sequence is a measure of its binding affinity for Mlc or NagC ( Table 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The inherent binding of NagC to its specific sites was ~ 10-fold stronger than Mlc to its specific sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The stronger binding of NagC to its sites , compared with Mlc binding to its sites , presumably reflects the importance of the C/G at +11 / -- 11 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Positive interaction between NagC and the C/G base pair at +11 / -- 11 presumably accounts for the higher affinity of NagC for its sites in vitro compared with Mlc for its sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Soluble unphosphorylated EIIBGlc can bind to Mlc , as demonstrated in SPR experiments ( 23 ) , but is not capable of preventing Mlc from binding to its cognate operator sites ( 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , in the absence of any interaction between the repressor proteins bound to two sites on the same template , the binding of NagC and Mlc to DNA is essentially identical , showing it is really the co-operative interaction that produces the distorted inter-operator footprints shown in Figure 3 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is also signiﬁcant that , of the two binding sites upstream of manXYZ , the site showing higher afﬁnity for Mlc has lower afﬁnity for NagC ( Plumbridge , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>) RESULTS Selection of random Mlc and NagC binding sites DNA fragments with affinity for NagC or Mlc were selected .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , at least one of the Mlc selected DNA binding sites , M120 , with limited homology to the NagC/Mlc consensus , did not bind to purified Mlc or NagC when tested in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>To verify the protein-binding specificity of the selected sites , some were tested in vitro for binding to Mlc and NagC .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Footprint of NagC and Mlc binding to the single nagB and nagE operators .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>On all three templates the DNaseI footprint produced by Mlc binding is qualitatively the same as that of NagC .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>( Note , since the absolute amounts of NagC or Mlc in the extracts are unknown it is only possible to compare the relative binding of the same extract with the different operators and not the binding of NagC and Mlc with the same operator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Binding of NagC and Mlc to some ` selected ' operators in vivo To examine the relative binding affinities of some of the selected Mlc and NagC binding sites in vivo , an ` operator titration ' technique was used .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>One reason for the apparent lack of regulation of nagE by Mlc could be the lower affinity of Mlc for the nagE operator for Mlc than for the other identified Mlc operators .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent experiments on the mlc-regulated genes showed that although NagC binding to Mlc operators could be detected in vitro , there was no or little regulation in vivo ( 6,17 , unpublished results ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although Mlc does bind specifically to both the nagE and nagB operators in vitro , no regulation of nagBE expression in vivo by the natural chromosomal copy of mlc was detected , even in the absence of NagC binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Binding of NagC and Mlc to nagE operators in vivo As Mlc showed a stronger affinity for the nagE operator than NagC , it seemed possible that Mlc might be able to regulate the nagE promoter in the absence of NagC in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>These experiments show that with the physiological concentrations of Mlc present in the cell , there is little binding of Mlc to the nagE operator , even in the absence of NagC binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>While Mlc binds well to both operators , NagC is only a weak repressor for mlc and does not repress malT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>To verify that Mlc does bind preferentially to the nagE operator in vivo , the effect of plasmids overproducing either Mlc or NagC was tested in a strain mutated for both mlc and nagC .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Even though the helix -- turn -- helix motifs of Mlc and NagC are almost identical and both proteins bind to similar sequences , there are distinctions in their operator selection .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , NagC did bind to the Mlc regulatory region .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>NagC and Mlc can bind to each others operator , at least in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>As described above , NagC and Mlc both bind very well to M134 in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Glc EIICB - enriched membrane vesicles incubated with Mlc under phosphorylating conditions ( in the presence of PEP and the three puri ® ed soluble PTS proteins ) exerted little effect on the binding activity of Mlc to its target DNA ( lanes 4 ± 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of 5 nM CAP ( lanes 7 -- 9 ) , all the DNA is supershifted into a more slowly migrating band at all three concentrations of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that under physiological conditions membrane sequestration of Mlc by unphosphorylated EIICBGlc , which builds up during the transport of glucose into the cell , is the key process in the inactivation of Mlc and leads to physical separation of Mlc from its DNA target sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Instead , Mlc is inactivated by binding to the dephosphorylated EIIBGlc domain of the EIICBGlc during glucose transport ( 13 , 16 , 28 , 34 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>543 The current model is that dephosphorylated EIICBGlc generated during glucose uptake binds Mlc and sequesters the repressor away from its DNA-binding sites ( 16 , 19 , 23 , 43 , 48 ; for reviews see references 4 and 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of glucose , dephosphorylated EIICBGlc , which is generated during glucose uptake , binds Mlc and sequesters the repressor away from its DNA-binding sites ( 13 , 16 , 28 , 34 ; for reviews , see references 3 and 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc is a DNA binding regulatory protein that represses transcription of its target genes , including ptsG , in the absence of glucose ( 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17209026" target="_blank">17209026</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , free glucose , even 100 mM , does not prevent DNA binding of Mlc during footprint or band shift assays .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>The dephospho-form of enzyme IICB , but not its phospho-form , interacts directly with Mlc and induces transcription of Mlc-regulated genes by displacing Mlc from its target sequences .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The dephospho-form of EIICBGlc displaces Mlc from its target promoters to induce transcription in vitro To support the idea that EIICBGlc induces the Mlc regulon by interacting with and displacing Mlc from its target DNA in the presence of glucose , the effect of EIICBGlc on the binding of Mlc to its target sites on the pts P0 , ptsG and mlc promoters was examined by gel shift assays and in vitro transcription analysis ( Figure 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The addition of EIICBGlc-enriched membrane vesicles to the reaction mixture inhibited the binding of Mlc to its target sites on the pts P0 , ptsG and mlc promoters in the presence of glucose , whereas EIICBGlc-de ® cient membrane vesicles did not inhibit the binding of Mlc ( lanes 1 ± 3 and 7 ± 9 , Figure 5A ; data not shown for the mlc promoter ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The strength of the interaction between the dephosphoform of EIICBGlc and Mlc was compared with that of the interaction between Mlc and its target DNA sites , in order to obtain a perspective on whether the dephospho-form of EIICBGlc could sequester Mlc from binding to the operator sites in the target promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The dephospho-form of EIICBGlc displaces Mlc from its target DNA to induce transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , no binding of Mlc to the ldhA upstream region was detected in vitro , at least under standard conditions ( J. Plumbridge , personal communication ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11535784" target="_blank">11535784</a>]<br></li>
<li>We examined the possibility that the inducer relieves repression by Mlc without affecting the binding of Mlc to its binding site using in vitro transcription assay .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>MtfA derivatives with the substitutions S142F , D156N , A207D , V216D , or Y243S , respectively , exhibited both reduced enzyme activity and reduced Mlc binding , which might indicate severe changes in structure and function .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the MtfA derivative N145D with reduced Mlc binding capacity was only stimulated to 123 % of the wild-type activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our in vivo results indicated that the interaction between MtfA and Mlc prevents binding of the repressor to the ptsG operator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , binding of EIIBGlc to Mlc might either not cause any conformational change of the repressor , or there might be no similar conformational change as caused by MtfA binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is tempting to speculate that Mlc binding causes a conformational change in MtfA , which may override selfinhibition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , we reveal that Mlc possesses a built-in ﬂexibility for the structural adaptation to its target DNA and that interaction of Mlc with EIIB fused only to dimeric proteins resulted in the loss of its DNA binding ability , suggesting that ﬂexibility of the Mlc structure is indispensable for its DNA binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , the two regions from positions 132 to 149 and positions 214 to 243 seemed to be essential for the binding of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this case , interaction between Mlc and PtsG would sequester Mlc to the cytoplasmic membrane and prevent it binding to its chromosomal operators .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Membrane localization , and not binding to EIICBGlc , seems to be responsible for the inactivation of Mlc in this process ( 39 , 44 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the binding of Mlc to EIICBGlc occurred in a phosphorylationdependent manner .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Determination of the binding af ® nity of Mlc interaction with EIICBGlc and its target sequences of the Mlc regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Instead , by anchoring the Mlc tetramer to the membrane via EIICBGlc , the structural ﬂexibility of Mlc mono-mers within the complex becomes restricted , which seems to be responsible for the loss of its DNA-binding activity ( 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the underlying mechanisms of how the phosphorylation of EIICBGlc affects the interaction with Mlc and why Mlc loses its DNA-binding activity when localized to the membrane still remain unexplained .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Then , a question remains as to why Mlc loses its DNA-binding ability when localized to the membrane .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>If this is the case , any kind of structural restriction hindering the domain arrangement of Mlc would inhibit binding of Mlc to its target DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Some evidence in favour of this hypothesis is that extracts of cells overproducing PtsG from a plasmid can inhibit the binding of Mlc to its target DNA operators in a bandshift assay .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , DNA-binding activity of Mlc in E. coli is not regulated by a small molecular inducer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , Mlc efficiently binds to DNA , indicating a rearrangement of HTH motifs in Mlc upon DNA binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>It was selected for binding to Mlc and binds Mlc as well as M1 , M3 and M26 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Changing the interoperator distance could perhaps increase binding by Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it is highly likely that these residues are directly involved in Mlc binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been reported that Mlc regulates manXYZ encoding enzyme II of the mannose PTS ( 4 ) , 1 The abbreviations used are : CRP , cyclic AMP receptor protein ; PTS , phosphoenolpyruvate : carbohydrate phosphotransferase system .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>The purified monomeric Grx2-EIIB construct produced a supershifted complex with DNA and Mlc , meaning that this construct did not induce the conformational change of Mlc to disassociate it from DNA ( Fig. 4C , lanes 3 -- 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The lower possibility of interactions between Mlc and the membrane led us to assume that the restriction of the structure flexibility of Mlc set by membrane localization might be responsible for the loss of its DNA-binding activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The retarded mobility of DNA by Mlc in the presence of EIIB ( Fig. 4B ) ascertains that EIIB binding alone has no effect on both the structure and DNA-binding activity of Mlc , and the membrane localization exerts an essential role in preventing Mlc from binding to DNA in vivo ( 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The anchoring of four ends to the membrane should significantly restrict the freedom in the domain arrangement of Mlc ( Fig. 4E ) , preventing the essential induced fit of Mlc for DNA binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The side chains of Thr-423 and Gln-456 in EIIB could make hydrogen bonds with the guanidino group of Arg-145 and the amide nitrogen of Leu-146 in Mlc , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The phosphorylation of EIIB makes Mlc dissociate from P-EIIB and bind to its target operators .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The inability of P-EIIB to make Arg-424-mediated intermolecular interactions is thus the cause of the inability of P-EIIB to-bind to Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The purified Mlc could inhibit transcription from both promoters but the degree of repression was dependent on the kind of s factor and the promoter ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>The condition seems to be similar to the in vitro transcription condition where both CRPzcAMP and a small amount of Mlc were present as shown in lane 6 of Fig. 3A .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Mlc regulon is also under the positive control of the CRP1zcAMP complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>The carboxy terminus of MtfA binds Mlc in a bacterial two-hybrid assay .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Structural Flexibility of Mlc Is Essential for Its DNA-Binding Activity and for Its Regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The pattern of repression by FruR at its different targets seems to parallel that of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>The effect of plasmids overproducing the Mlc protein was also tested .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>The identity of the effector for Mlc is still unclear .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>The autoregulatory effect of Mlc on its own gene in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>The effect was even more severe with untagged Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results ruled out the possibility of an indirect effect via Mlc repression of malT transcription as the reason for the effects of H-NS and StpA found .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9829919" target="_blank">9829919</a>]<br></li>
<li>The autoregulation presumably keeps the Mlc level rather constant ; this idea argues against the hypothesis that the effect of H-NS deﬁciency is mediated via Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9829919" target="_blank">9829919</a>]<br></li>
<li>A common feature of the ® ve operons thus far identi ® ed as members of the Mlc regulon is that they possess at least one cAMP ± CRP binding site as well as an Mlc binding site , and thus are under dual regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The common feature of five operons ( manXYZ , malT , mlc , ptsG , and pts ) identified as the Mlc regulon so far is that all of them have at least one CRPzcAMP binding site as well as a Mlc binding site , and thus they are under the dual regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , Mlc binding to its operator binding site was not required by the regulatory circuit leading to pH , regulation of maltose regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , malT , mlc and manXYZ are probably regulated by Mlc binding to only a single operator site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Does Mlc mediate repression of ptsG via DNA loop formation ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>As two Mlc binding sites are located upstream of ptsG , it is pertinent to ask whether Mlc regulation of ptsG involves DNA loop formation between the two Mlc operators .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>The low binding affinity of Mlc to its own promoter that is 10 times weaker than that to ptsG or pts P0 promoters ( 9 ) seems to be a major reason for the low influence of Mlc on regulation of its own gene .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Mlc protein binds to two sites centred at ¹ 6 and ¹ 175 upstream of the major ptsG transcript .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>The increase in ptsG transcripts in the absence of SgrS can in part be explained by the expected release of Mlc repression after aMG treatment ( Plumbridge , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15522088" target="_blank">15522088</a>]<br></li>
<li>Negative regulation of manX expression by NagC and Mlc The DNase I footprint of NagC on the manX regulatory region had shown two NagC boxes with NagC binding more strongly to the upstream , promoter-distal site ( Plumbridge and Kolb , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Mlc protein plays a primary role in transcriptional regulation of this operon in inducible strains ( Plumbridge , 1998b ; Plumbridge and Kolb , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11361063" target="_blank">11361063</a>]<br></li>
<li>The net result is that there is no cross-regulation of nagE expression by physiological concentrations of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The range of regulation produced by Mlc is quantitatively more important than that of FruR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>A similar pattern is observed for Mlc regulation of its own gene .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>This means that in accordance with the current model of ptsG regulation , Mlc is epistatic to both EIICBGlc and YeeI .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here we report identiﬁcation of a novel protein , YeeI , that is involved in the regulation of ptsG by interacting with Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>These factors have therefore been reinvestigated in the light of Mlc regulation of ptsG and ptsHI .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>In view of its regulation by Mlc , one might almost regard LDH as the ﬁnal step in the PTS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11535784" target="_blank">11535784</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the other operons controlled by Mlc , regulation involves just a single Mlc site and the induction factors are lower .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>With Mlc , certain cleavages are repressed in the inter-operator region and the pattern of hypersensitive bands is less pronounced .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc is known to repress the MalT activator , so perhaps it might activate transcription of an ldhA-speciﬁc activator that is yet to be identiﬁed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11535784" target="_blank">11535784</a>]<br></li>
<li>Purified Mlc repressed transcription from both promoters , but with different degrees of inhibition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because Mlc can not interact with pEIICBGlc , Mlc dissociates from pEIICBGlc to-bind to target promoters and repress their transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consequently , the sequestered Mlc can not bind its target promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>In an attempt to identify the inducer , a series of sugars and sugar phosphates were tested for their ability to displace Mlc from its malT operator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>The possibility that the inducer of Mlc may not be sugar or its derivative but an unknown factor is proposed to explain the Mlc induction mechanism by various sugars .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>We are testing this possibility , and further work is needed to discover the inducer of Mlc would be .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , in contrast to other regulatory systems , there is no intracellular low-molecular-weight inducer for Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Not the activity but the expression of malT is controlled by Mlc , a transcriptional-regulator acting as a repressor ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16321936" target="_blank">16321936</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of malT is controlled by a repressor called Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus the regulatory effect of Mlc on ldhA appears to be indirect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11535784" target="_blank">11535784</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is interesting to note that the magnitude of the Mlc effect is very similar for malT and manXYZ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is interesting to compare the NagC -- Mlc pair with the isorepressors , GalS and GalR , of the gal regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is worthwhile to compare Mlc with the FruR repressor ( recently renamed Cra for catabolite repressor/activator ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Remarkably , JSW2 harboring the super-repressor Mlc * H86R exhibited almost no basal - galactosidase activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , we demonstrated the ability of MtfA to inactivate an Mlc super-repressor , which can not be inactivated by EIICBGlc , by using in vivo titration and gel shift assays .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the present study we could demonstrate that MtfA is still able to-bind and inactivate Mlc * H86R both in vivo and in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Titration of Mlc by MtfA and its derivatives in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>MtfA binds to the super repressor Mlc * H86R in vivo and in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>This clearly supports the notion that MtfA-Mlc interaction de facto occurs at the C domain of Mlc , which may , in contrast to the EIIBGlc-Mlc interaction , result in either severe changes in the conformation of the D domain or the prevention of repressor oli-gomerization .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>This seemed to indicate that the inactivation mechanisms of Mlc by unphosphorylated EIIBGlc and MtfA differ signiﬁcantly .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since Mlc can not bind to the EIIBGlc domain in this strain , it can only be inactivated by MtfA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , we could demonstrate that MtfA binds speciﬁcally to the carboxy-terminal segment of Mlc , which is usually involved in protein tetramerization .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , the carboxy-terminal part of Mlc seems to be important for this interaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , in the ﬁrst part of this study we further characterized the speciﬁc interaction between MtfA and Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , inactivation of Mlc by MtfA is reﬂected by high - galactosidase activities .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , L-glutamic-acid-4-nitroanilide as an acidic amino acid and substrates larger in size , such as L-alanine - FIG 3 - Galactosidase activities for the quantiﬁcation of the interactions between MtfA wild type or derivatives thereof with Mlc in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>FIG 9 Protease activities of MtfA wild type and MtfAN145D in the absence or presence of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>The cleavage efﬁciency of L-alanine 4-nitroanilide by MtfA or MtfAN145D was assayed in the presence or absence of Mlc as indicated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>The mutant protein MtfAN145D , which displayed a reduced interaction with Mlc in vivo ( Fig. 3 ) but almost wild-type proteolytic activity ( Fig. 8 ) , was signiﬁcantly less stimulated by His-tagged Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results of in vivo phenotyping of the interaction between MtfA and its derivatives with Mlc led to the conclusion that amino acids from residue 132 onward appear to be necessary for this interaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>This proteolytic activity of MtfA modulated by Mlc constitutes a newly identiﬁed PTS output signal that responds to changes in environmental conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>As illustrated in Fig. 9 , the addition of amino-terminal His-tagged Mlc to the standard assay led to an increased proteolytic activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , we characterized the proteolytic activity of puriﬁed MtfA by monitoring cleavage of amino 4-nitroanilide substrates and show Mlc 's ability to enhance this activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the contrary , addition of Mlc stimulates MtfA amino-peptidase activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>The addition of puriﬁed Mlc with an amino-terminal His-tagged or addition of an untagged Mlc version stimulated MtfA enzyme activity up to 175 % .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the Y205S/A207D double mutant , the decreasing interaction with Mlc appeared to be due to a cumulative effect , since each single mutation exhibited higher - galactosidase activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , addition of glucose , which leads to EIICBGlc dephosphorylation and thus titration of Mlc , resulted in an increase in the amount of Mlc in a yeeI background ( Fig. 2C , lane 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>In accordance with the autoregulation of dgsA ( 7 , 23 ) , YeeI overproduction resulted in a clear 3.8-fold increase in the quantity of Mlc ( Fig. 3C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>In ptsG mutants , Mlccontrolled genes become non-inducible as no PtsG is available to-bind Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11535784" target="_blank">11535784</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of any evidence for phosphate transfer to Mlc , an alternative model can be proposed to explain the role of PtsG in induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>In summary , Mlc appears to undergo no conformational changes upon complex formation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this view , Mlc can act as a response-regulator whose activity is modulated by enzyme IICBGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to size-exclusion chromatography , Mlc behaved as a tetramer regardless of the presence of EIIB , indicating that Mlc keeps its tetrameric conformation upon complex formation ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>sible for Mlc inactivation in that Mlc complexed with EIIB or GST-EIIB complex keeps tetrameric conformation ( data not shown ) and that a dimeric mutant of Mlc still binds DNA ( SI Fig. 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>This indicates that the level of Mlc in the cell is probably limiting and , under normal growth conditions , each site is only partially occupied .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , Cys-421 of EIIB , the phosphorylation site , is 5 Å away from Mlc in the Mlc/EIIB structure , making no direct contact with Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>

<li>This may allow the phosphor-ylated EIIA to access EIIB in the complex with Mlc and thus to transfer a phosphate group to EIIB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>This complementarity between Ala-451 of EIIB and Phe-136 of Mlc was also verified by employing SPR spectroscopy after site-directed mutagenesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>This does not rule out the possibility that Mlc may also control individual mal genes directly , which is difﬁcult to test as malE or malK can not be expressed in the absence of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is not known if Mlc is involved in the regulation of the nagE and mtlA genes , even though positive regulation of nagE by the CRPzcAMP complex was reported recently ( 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>As expected , pts P0 , one of several genes known to be under Mlc control ( 6 -- 8 ) , was not induced in the DrpoH strain ( Fig. 5B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>All genes known to be regulated negatively by Mlc , such as manXYZ , malT , ptsG , and pts , are also regulated positively by CRPzcAMP ( 2 -- 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>All genes that are so far known to be under the control of Mlc are also regulated by CRPzcAMP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>When Mlc was overproduced , it has been known to reduce acetate accumulation [ 37 ] , and causes slow growth but gives better performance for recombinant protein production [ 38 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19055729" target="_blank">19055729</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Mlc protein was initially cloned because of its ability to enhance the use of glucose in rich media ; on a plasmid , it slowed down growth , leading to a reduction in the accumulation of acetate and , hence , produced larger colonies ( mlc 1/4 making larger colonies ) ( Hosono et al. , 1995 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>To construct the rpoH-deleted mutant , SR701 ( SR702 , DrpoH ) , DrpoH allele of KY1603 ( 26 ) was transferred to SR702 When Mlc is overproduced on a multicopy plasmid in Esch-erichia coli grown in the presence of glucose , it causes reduction of acetate accumulation and E. coli makes large colonies ( 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>When Mlc ( making large colonies ) is overproduced on a multicopy plasmid in E. coli grown in the presence of glucose , it causes reduction of acetate accumulation and E. coli makes large colonies ( Hosono et al. , 1995 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>Dephosphorylated IICBGlc generated by glucose uptake binds Mlc , resulting in sequestration of this global transcription factor to the membrane ( Lee et al. 2000 ; Tanaka et al. 2000 ; GENES & DEVELOPMENT 19:328 -- 338 © 2005 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 0890-9369/05 ; www.genesdev.or Nam et al. 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15650111" target="_blank">15650111</a>]<br></li>
<li>We have demonstrated recently that the transcription of the manXYZ operon is subject to positive regulation by cAMP/CAP and negative regulation by the Mlc protein ( Plumbridge , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>CRP-cAMP action is independent from Mlc The pts operon expression is under the positive control by CRP-cAMP in vivo ( De Reuse & Danchin 1988 ; De Reuse & Danchin 1991 ; De Reuse et al. 1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the intracellular level of EIICBGlc is at least 100 times higher than that of Mlc and its target promoters ( Kimata et al. , 1998 ; Kim et al. , 1999 ; Rohwer et al. , 2000 ) , and the Kd of the interaction between Mlc and the pts P0 and ptsG promoters is only ~ 10-fold lower than that between EIICBGlc and Mlc , it is reasonable to assume that Mlc could be completely displaced from its target DNA sites by interacting with EIICBGlc under physiological conditions in the presence of glucose in the medium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the ptsG promoter is much stronger than that of mlc , and the concentration of Mlc in E.coli is limiting ( Kimata et al. , 1998 ; Kim et al. , 1999 ) , the increased level of EIICBGlc should completely sequester the induced level of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The simplest explanation of these data is that the pre-sence of glucose has two opposing effects : it induces the ptsG transcript , presumably by leading to the production of the inducing signal for the Mlc protein ( although this has not been demonstrated ) and also represses the transcript resulting from catabolite repression lowering of the cAMP/CAP concentration ( Epstein et al. , 1975 ; Ishizuka et al. , 1994 ; reviewed in Kolb et al. , 1993 ; Saier et al. , Fig. 6 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>The EIIB domain in the Glc Glc dephosphorylated state ( for instance , in the presence of glucose ) binds the transcription repressor Mlc of the ptsG gene and thereby induces ( activates ) expression of EIICB ( Plumbridge , 1998 , 1999 ; Glc Tanaka et al. , 1999 ; Lee et al. , 2000 ; Nam et al. , 2001 , 2008 ; Seitz et al. , 2003 ; Tanaka et al. , 2004 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20516600" target="_blank">20516600</a>]<br></li>
<li>Dephosphorylated IICB , for Glc instance , forms a complex with the repressor Mlc and by sequestering it promotes expression of glucose-related genes ( Lee et al , 2000 ; Tanaka et al , 2000 ; Nam et al , 2001 ; Plumbridge , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15616579" target="_blank">15616579</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of the ptsG mRNA is positively regulated by the cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) - cAMP receptor protein ( CrpA ) complex , and negatively controlled by Mlc , a global repressor responsible for sugar transport and utilization ( Kimata et al. 1997 , 1998 ; Plumbridge 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18368388" target="_blank">18368388</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , ptsG transcription is activated by the cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) receptor protein ( CRP ) ( 2 ) , and negative control is exerted by the repressor Mlc , which inhibits ptsG transcription in the absence of glucose ( 3 , 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23873911" target="_blank">23873911</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ptsG transcription is regulated simultaneously by two global transcription factors , CRP ( cAMP receptor protein ) -- cAMP and Mlc , in response to glucose availability ( Kimata et al. 1997 , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15650111" target="_blank">15650111</a>]<br></li>
<li>The cAMP receptor protein , CRP , is required for activation of ptsG transcription ( De Reuse and Danchin , 1988 ; Fox et al. , 1992 ) , whereas the negative regulatory protein Mlc represses ptsG transcription in the absence of glucose ( Kimata et al. , 1998 ; Plumbridge , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15522088" target="_blank">15522088</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recently , we and others have found that the transcription of ptsG encoding for IICBGlc , a membrane component of the major glucose transporter , is under the negative control by a global repressor Mlc and that glucose induces the ptsG transcription by affecting the Mlc-mediated regulatory pathway ( Kimata et al. 1998 ; Plumbridge 1998b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>CRP-cAMP may activate the P0 transcription by eliminating the Mlc action because CRP-cAMP is required for the expression of ptsG encoding the glucose transporter ( Kimata et al. 1998 ; Plumbridge 1998b ) and therefore glucose is no longer transported via glucose-speciﬁc PTS in the crp cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fis either helps Mlc to repress or Crp to activate the ptsG gene transcription , which is decided by the availability of glucose ( Shin et al. 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18368388" target="_blank">18368388</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this strain , ptsG mRNA accumulated in response to glucose , probably because of increased ptsG transcription resulting from glucose-responsive derepression by the negative regulator Mlc ( Kimata et al. , 1998 ; Plumbridge , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15522088" target="_blank">15522088</a>]<br></li>
<li>In their study identifying Mlc as the negative regulator of ptsG transcription , Kimata et al. ( 1998 ) noted that in wildtype cells , ptsG is never maximally expressed because induction by glucose ( Mlc derepression ) simultaneously causes catabolite repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15522088" target="_blank">15522088</a>]<br></li>
<li>The soluble PTS proteins , enzyme I ( EI ) and HPr , are common to all ( or nearly all ) PTS sugars and function to funnel phosphate groups from PEP to to be mediated by the Mlc protein ( Kimata et al. , 1998 ; Plumbridge , 1998a ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of the mal genes is dependent upon the positive transcriptional-regulator MalT , and the malT gene is itself negatively regulated by Mlc ( Decker et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of malT is itself negatively regulated by mlc , so that Mlc indirectly regulates the mal regulon ( Decker et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , ldhA appears to be under control of both CsrAB ( Liu et al. , 1997 ; Romeo , 1998 ) and Mlc ( Kim et al. , 1999 ; Plumbridge , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11535784" target="_blank">11535784</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regulation of ptsG expression involves a complex mechanism whereby PtsG directly binds its transcriptional-regulator , Mlc ( Kimata et al. , 1999 ; Plumbridge , 1998a , 1999 , 2000 ; Tanaka et al. , 2000 ; Zeppenfeld et al. , 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11361063" target="_blank">11361063</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc band was not detectable in MC4100 due to low expression ( Kim et al. , 1999 ; Kimata et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of Mlc , malT expression is increased by a factor of 2-3 when E. coli is grown in glycerol ( Decker et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this work , we have studied the effect of Mlc , a newly established global regulator for carbon metabolism ( Decker et al. 1998 ; Kimata et al. 1998 ; Plumbridge 1998a , b ) , on pts operon expression in order to determine if Mlc mediates the glucose effect on pts operon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>A series of sugar and sugar phosphates , considered potential candidates for the inducer , were tested for their effect by gel shift analysis on Mlc binding to the manX and malT , but none showed any effect ( Decker et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , the and is repressed by the binding of Mlc ( Decker et al. , use of plasmid operon fusions , which maintained a 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , as reported previously ( Decker et al. , 1998 ; Plumbridge , 1998a ) , we were unable to detect any common glucose derivative that could displace Mlc from its binding sites in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Mlc regulator autoregulates transcription of its own gene ( Decker et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11535784" target="_blank">11535784</a>]<br></li>
<li>The epistatic effect of mlc on glucose is also observed with the other genes so far known to be regulated by Mlc ( Decker et al. , 1998 ; Plumbridge , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Attempts to identify a direct inducer for Mlc have been unsuccessful so far because a variety of sugars including glucose itself had no effect on Mlc in vitro ( Decker et al. 1998 ; Kimata et al. 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results , combined with the fact that the basal level of ptsG expression was reduced even in yeeI strains , indicated that the steady-state level of Mlc is lower in the absence of YeeI but is still sufﬁcient for ptsG repression TABLE 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results indicate that the intra cellular concentration of Mlc increases enough to reduce the acetate accumulation in SR754 , even though the expression level of Mlc in SR754 is lower than that in MC4100 expressing the mlc from multicopy plasmid .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results also show that , although these sugars are the substrates of the transporter , they are apparently not the inducer of Mlc nor metabolically convertible into the inducer , as their presence does not enhance the expression of the operon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results imply that ( i ) the DNA upstream of -120 and Mlc do not contribute to the repression of malT expression during growth in basal M M at low pH , and ( ii ) the CAMP-CRP complex is required for the pH , modulation of malT transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>Induction of plasmid-encoded mtfA in both strain backgrounds resulted in high expression of the ptsGop-lacZ fusion , meaning that both wildtype Mlc and Mlc * H86R can be bound and inactivated by MtfA .

<li>Thus far , the cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) complex and Mlc are known to be the major regulators of ptsHIcrr and ptsG expression in response to the availability of carbon sources .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since Mlc acts as a repressor of ptsG transcription , overproduction of Mlc might repress ptsG expression to the extent that there is insufﬁcient EIICBGlc protein for transport of the inducer MG .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17209026" target="_blank">17209026</a>]<br></li>
<li>Figures 1 and 4 indicate that ptsG gene expression decreased ( p < 0.05 ) in accordance with the up-regulation of mlc gene expression , while ptsH did not follow such pattern , where ptsH is not under control of Mlc and it was activated partly due to down-regulation of cra gene expression ( Additional file 2 ) .

<li>Interestingly , overexpression of MtfA caused a signiﬁcant increase of ptsG expression in the absence of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc appears to be the ultimate regulator , as in all genetic backgrounds tested , mlc mutations produce high expression of both ptsG and ptsH p0 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>

<li>Despite the fact that NagC is homologous to Mlc and that binding of NagC to both the ptsG and the ptsH operators can be detected by DNAse I footprinting in vitro , there is no effect of a nagC mutation on the expression of either ptsG or ptsH ( Table 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of ptsG is controlled by Mlc binding to two operators upstream of two promoters , both of which are subject to Mlc repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is tempting to speculate that tetramerization of the repressor is inhibited by binding of YeeI to the carboxy-termi-nal region of Mlc and repression of ptsG expression can not take place .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>In conclusion , we identiﬁed a new protein involved in ptsG expression by binding and inactivating Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>The resulting increase in unphosphorylated EIICBGlc causes the increase in the formation of the Mlc ± EIICBGlc complex , derepressing expression of its target genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The loss of Mlc function led to a threefold increase in malT expression , and the presence of mlc on a multicopy plasmid reduced malT expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results showed that the 2-fold increase in the ptsG expression by arcA deletion was independent of the regulation by Mlc in that increased ptsG expression in the mlc strain was still doubled by the introduction of arcA mutation .

The fact that the presence of a null mutation in arcA leads to an increase in ptsG expression regardless of Mlc suggests that ArcA should be the direct repressor of ptsG .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></label>

<div class="ACT_similar">
<li>The fact that the presence of a null mutation in mlc leads to an increase in ptsG expression suggests that Mlc is a repressor for ptsG .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li></div>
<li>The lacZ fusion data revealed that expression of ptsG is negatively regulated by ArcA , and this effect is independent of Mlc ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of Mlc-controlled genes seems to be correlated with the presence of nonphosphorylated EIIBC ( encoded by ptsG ) Glc and might be explained by a physical interaction between EIICB and Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Plasmids overproducing either the NagC protein or the Mlc protein repress the expression of manX , but the effect of the Mlc protein is stronger .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>It was thus pertinent to test the effect of the Mlc protein on manX expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Effect of overproduced NagC and Mlc on manX -- lacZ and borG -- lacZ expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Plasmids expressing either NagC or Mlc produce considerable repression of the nagBE -- lacZ looped fusion , reducing expression 88 - and 56-fold ( Table 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , mlc expression is subject to weak catabolite repression , which apparently eliminates any derepression resulting from the absence of Mlc itself .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>pMlc2 , in which mlc is expres-sed from its own promoter , represses ptsG expression more than 10-fold , while the pTZ ( Mlc ) plasmid , in which Mlc is expressed from the lac promoter , produces nearly 100-fold repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Using a mlc -- lacZ fusion in a mlc and mlcþ background , we found that Mlc represses its own expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc regulates ( represses ) its own expression A mlc -- lacZ fusion was constructed using a plasmid harbouring mlc under the control of its own promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Noticeable increase in the level of Mlc expression was seen only in SR754 ( Fig. 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the culture reached an A600 5 0.5 , tryptophan ( 0.1 mg/ml ) was added to induce the expression of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>This indicates that Mlc regulates malT expression and affects malK expression merely indirectly via the regulation of malT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc regulates ( represses ) its own expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc not only regulates malT expression but also represses the man operon ( 259 ) when overproduced ( 189 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , a plasmid ( pKDmlc ) was used to transform KM563 to test the effect of elevated levels of Mlc on mlc expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , Mlc expression is autoregulated by Mlc itself .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19055729" target="_blank">19055729</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , Mlc expression is autoregulated by Mlc itself and start codon of mlc is GUG .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of Mlc , a repressor of malT expression , the pH , regulation of malT was still effective .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the overexpression of Mlc from a heat-inducible plasmid , pKDmlc , decreased malT expression , Table 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>In mutants lacking Mlc , the expression of malT is increased by a factor of 2 to 3 when grown in glycerol .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>A recent report ( 10 ) showed that the transcription of malT is negatively controlled by the mlc gene product and that a loss of Mlc function leads to a threefold increase in malT expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9829919" target="_blank">9829919</a>]<br></li>
<li>At present , it is not known if expression of the mlc gene is affected by H-NS and/or StpA , but evidently Mlc is subject to autoregulation and represses its own expression ( 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9829919" target="_blank">9829919</a>]<br></li>
<li>demonstrating that Mlc controls mal gene expression by regulating the amount of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Strong repression was observed in the presence of overproduced Mlc , and a threefold derepression was observed in the presence of an mlc null mutation ( Tables 4 and 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>To further test this hypothesis , an allele of ptsG under the control of the constitutive Pbla promoter ( not susceptible to repression by Mlc ) was moved to the PsgrS-lacZ strain , and the mlc clone pBRCV10 was tested in this background .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17209026" target="_blank">17209026</a>]<br></li>
<li>As expected , Western blots showed that in the Pbla-ptsG background , the mlc plasmid pBRCV10 no longer affected levels of EIICBGlc ( Fig. 7B ) , since the Pbla promote can not be repressed by Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17209026" target="_blank">17209026</a>]<br></li>
<li>Division of Biological Science , Graduate School of Science , Nagoya University , Chikusa , Nagoya 464-8601 , Japan Results : We found by Northern blotting that the pts mRNA levels in cells lacking Mlc , a new global repressor of carbohydrate metabolism , were increased without external glucose and that the addition of glucose had no effect on the pts mRNA levels in the mutant cells .

<li>However , none of the sugars or their derivatives tested ( glucose , glucose-6-P , malt-ose , mannitol , mannose , xylose , melibiose , pyruvate , N-acetyl-glucosamine , methyl - - thiogalactoside ) showed any effect on b D the repression by Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>Level of Mlc expression can vary precisely in response to the available sugars but the variation range is less than 2-fold in that the availability of unphosphorylated Glc EIICB may be more critical than the intracellular level of Mlc for induction of the Mlc regulon by glucose as shown in our previous report ( 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results support the view that the expression of EIICBGlc and Mlc is balanced in response to glucose uptake even when the cells were heat-shocked and that Es32 plays an important role in this regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been shown that Eσ32 plays an important role in balancing the relative concentration of Mlc and EIICB in response to the availability of glucose in order to maintain inducibility of Mlc regulon at higher temperature [ 28 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19055729" target="_blank">19055729</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results indicate that Es32 plays an important role in bal - ancing the relative concentration of Mlc and EIICBGlc in response to availability of glucose in order to maintain inducibility of the Mlc regulon at high growth temperature .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>When cells were grown in the absence of glucose , a similar level of expression from both P1 and P2 was observed even though the P2 transcription is more sensitive to Mlc repression probably because the intracellular concentration of Mlc is limiting in E. coli ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vivo transcription assays using wild type and mlc-negative E. coli strains grown in the presence and absence of glucose indicate that Mlc negatively regulates expression of the P0 promoter , and Mlc-de-pendent repression is relieved by glucose in the growth medium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>Construction of the strains with increased Mlc expression colonies when it was grown in the presence of glucose , if mlc was overexpressed on a multicopy plasmid .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>In order to examine whether Mlc is involved in the glucose-dependent stimulation of pts expression , we have analysed RNAs prepared from the mlc cells grown in the presence and absence of glucose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>When Mlc was induced and the concentration of CRPzcAMP was lowered by the addition of glucose in the growth medium , the P1 promoter was activated slightly while the P2 promoter was repressed because the P2 promoter is active only in the presence of CRPzcAMP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>When Mlc is inactivated in the presence of glucose , ptsG transcription is induced .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15650111" target="_blank">15650111</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of glucose , Mlc derepression at the ptsG promoter results in higher levels of ptsG transcription ( 5 , 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17209026" target="_blank">17209026</a>]<br></li>
<li>We tested the effect of Mlc on transcription of the P0 promoter in vivo by primer extension assay of total RNA extracted from cells grown in the presence or absence of glucose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>When cells were grown in the presence of glucose promoter , P2 , and that both P1 and P2 transcription is regulated negatively by Mlc ( 3 , 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>Repression of the P2 transcription when cells were grown in the presence of glucose implies that the action of CRPzcAMP is dominant over the self-repression by Mlc in the regulation of the mlc P2 promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>Only P0 is subject to Mlc repression , and the overall expression of ptsH and ptsI is induced about fourfold during growth-on-glucose ( 28 ) , whereas transcription from the P2 promoter in front of crr is constitutive .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test whether the transcription from the upstream ptsH p0 promoter , which has been shown previously to be induced by glucose , is also regulated by Mlc , ptsH mRNA levels were examined in mlc and mlc strains .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Figure 5B , EIICBGlc dephosphorylated by adding glucose could relieve repression of the pts P0 transcription by Mlc , whereas the phosphorylated form of EIICBGlc did not affect Mlc action .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that Mlc is a repressor of the pts P0 promoter , and Mlc-dependent repression is relieved by glucose in the growth medium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that the pts transcription is under the negative control of Mlc and that glucose eliminates the Mlc-mediated repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>We propose that glucose induces the pts transcription by modulating the Mlc activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>This ﬁnding has prompted us to examine whether the stimulation of external glucose of the pts operon transcription is also mediated by Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this study , a procedure is described for purification of the active form of Mlc to homogeneity , and the effects of Mlc on the expression of the pts P0 promoter were studied to determine whether the in vivo glucose effect on pts operon expression is mediated by Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results also indicated that the action of Mlc in the regulation of the pts operon is dominant over that of CRPzcAMP as proposed for the regulation of ptsG expression by Mlc recently ( 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our data also suggest that glucose induces pts expression by modulating the Mlc action .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>While the regulation of pts expression by glucose is mediated by Mlc , it is closely linked to CRP-cAMP control .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>As EIICBGlc is dephosphorylated faster than it can be rephosphorylated by PEP in the presence of glucose , the induced EIICBGlc sequesters more Mlc , forming a positive feedback loop ( D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>When glucose is depleted , the overproduced Mlc will rapidly dissociate from the phosphoryl-ated EIICBGlc and shut down its target genes , forming a negative feedback loop ( Figure 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>When glucose is depleted , the overproduced Mlc dissociates from phosphorylated EIICBGlc and rapidly shuts down its target genes , forming a negative feedback loop ( A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>From these results , together with our previous data ( 9 ) , it could be assumed that the Mlc regulon could not be induced by glucose because not enough EIICBGlc was available to sequester Mlc in the DrpoH strain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , glucose is required to maximize the level of dephosphorylated EIICBGlc necessary to sequester Mlc that is increased by heat-shock .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>Based on our ﬁndings , we propose a model of MtfA as a glucose-regulated peptidase activated by cytoplasmic Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>We present a model that postulates MtfA to be a glucose-regulated peptidase , whose activity is regulated by binding to Mlc available in the cytoplasm , which in turn has been released from EIICBGlc during times when no glucose is taken up .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to the domain model , Mlc * H86R can not be inactivated by EIICBGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to the Mlc regulation model , running out of glucose would lead to a rephosphorylation of EIICBGlc and thus to a release of Mlc into the cytoplasm .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>The transcriptional-regulators under 32 control mostly sense extracellular conditions : Mlc senses glucose , Pho P/Q senses low Mg + + and is induced in acid stress , ZntR responds to excess Zn + + , and NarP induction requires nitrite/nitrate under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16818608" target="_blank">16818608</a>]<br></li>
<li>The activity of Mlc as repressor is controlled by the PtsG-mediated transport of glucose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16321936" target="_blank">16321936</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Mlc protein thus acts as a repressor for several catabolic operons whose products are linked to glucose metabolism .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc activity is regulated by its sequestration to the EIIBCGlc component of the glucose PTS ( 41 , 48 , 67 ) , and its overexpression leads to reduced sugar uptake and subsequently to less acetate formation ( 28 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12620868" target="_blank">12620868</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent results suggest that the signal for Mlc induction is the activation of the PTS by glucose or other PTS sugars rather than glucose per se ( 8,12 ) , and that induction of Mlc-controlled genes involves sequestration of Mlc to membranes containing dephosphorylated PtsG ( 13,14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>During transport of glucose and dephosphorylation of EIICBGlc , Mlc binds to the B domain of the transporter , resulting in derepression of several Mlc-regulated genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Glucose is the common intermediate in the genes so far known to be regulated by Mlc : manXYZ transports glucose as well as other hexoses , and metabolism of maltose generates intracellular Glc-1-P and glucose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>A connection to glucose seems to be the common factor in the genes regulated by Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the glucose induction of Mlc-regulated genes is caused by dephosphorylation of the membrane-bound transGlc porter enzyme IICB , which directly recruits Mlc to derepress its regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although Mlc was proven to be a mediator of glucose induction of several genes , the mechanism of this mediation was not understood .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc is therefore considered to be a global transcription factor responsible for the induction of genes in the presence of glucose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>This may indicate that the effector ( inducer ) for Mlc is a metabolic product of glucose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , it is likely that a metabolic product of glucose could be the controlling compound for Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>It seems likely that both CRPzcAMP and Mlc work together in E. coli to maintain the level of Mlc optimum in response to availability of glucose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is of obvious interest to determine whether Mlc is responsible for all glucose induction phenomena in E. coli or whether other mechanisms exist .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been known that the acetate accumulation is reduced even when E. coli is grown in the presence of high concentration of glucose if Mlc is overexpressed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>Changes in the concentration of glucose and acetate in the medium were measured to compare the effects of Mlc overexpression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this work , we studied the transcriptional regulation of the mlc gene in vitro as well as in vivo and 32 the role of Es in maintaining glucose-dependent induction of the Mlc regulon at high growth temperature .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc , for example , not only regulates ptsG gene expression but is also a signal mediator for glucose induction of the ptsHI-crr operon ( 20 , 29 , 34 ) , the malT gene for the transcriptional-activator of the maltose regulon ( 6 ) , the manXYZ operon for the mannose-PTS ( 18 ) , and enzymes involved in glycolysis ( 5 ) , respectively .

<li>Thus , three factors have so far been identi ® ed in the induction of ptsG and ptsHI expression : the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of the central PTS components , PtsG ( EIIBC ) and the transcriptional-regulator Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , ptsG encoding enzyme IICB of the glucose PTS ( EIICBglu ) and the pts operon encoding general PTS proteins are also known to be repressed by Mlc [ 41,42 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19055729" target="_blank">19055729</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , ptsG encoding enzyme IICB of the glucose PTS ( EIICBGlc ) and the pts operon encoding general PTS proteins also proved to be repressed by Mlc ( Kim et al. , 1999 ; Kimata et al. , 1998 ; Tanaka et al. , 1999 ; Nam et al. , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc controls the mlc gene itself , as well as the pts operon coding for EI , HPr and EIIAGlc , and the ptsG gene encoding EIICBGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of the ptsG gene encoding the glucose-PTS transporter EIICBGlc is primarily regulated via the repressor Mlc , whose inactivation is glucose dependent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>This leads to a model according to which the glucose sensor Mlc/EIICBGlc not only controls gene expression by Mlc , but that at least in E. coli it also regulates the proteolytic activity of MtfA in a glucose-dependent manner .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whereas Mlc is responsible for induction of ptsG ( and several other genes ) in the presence of glucose , the catabolite activator complex cAMP-CRP is also absolutely necessary for ptsG expression ( 15 , 26 , 32 , 48 ) .

<li>Both glucose and mlc induce ptsG expression , strongly suggesting that ptsG is the major target for Mlc regulation and that the inducer ought to be a glucose derivative .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Growth on other PTS sugars , besides glucose , also induces ptsH and ptsG expression , suggesting that the target of Mlc regulation is the PTS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this work , the possibility that the expression of the other glucose transporter , ptsG , is also subject to regulation by Mlc has been investigated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>

<li>In addition to induction by glucose and repression by Mlc , mutations in ptsHIcrr , which interrupt the PEP-dependent phosphate transfer through the soluble components of the PTS , lead to high expression of both ptsH and ptsG , while mutations inactivating EIIBC are non-inducible .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transport of glucose and other PTS sugars induces ptsH and ptsG expression There are several indications , as described above , that Mlc controls genes involved in glucose metabolism and that growth-on-glucose seems to generate the inducing signal to relieve Mlc repression of ptsG and ptsH .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>At the moment , it seems likely that growth-on-glucose is inducing ptsG and ptsH expression by relieving Mlc repression but , in the absence of the identi ® cation of the inducing signal between glucose and Mlc , this remains an assumption .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>These observations , induction by growth-on-glucose or an mlc mutation and repression by excess Mlc , are consistent with Mlc acting as a repressor for p0 and growth-on-glucose generating an inducing signal for Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Deletion of ptsG completely prevented induction of the ptsG-lacZ fusion by addition of glucose in strains harboring pTM30 or pTMByeeI-S , since Mlc can not be sequestered by EIICBGlc in this background ( Fig. 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>As neither of these carbon sources produces any signi ® cant induction of ptsH or ptsG expression ( Fig. 4 ) , it is dif ® cult to envisage how a glucose-speci ® c metabolite could be produced intracellularly to displace Mlc from its operators .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>The importance of Es32 in glucose induction of the Mlc regulon was manifested by the fact that glucose induction of ptsG could not be observed in the DrpoH strain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>Until the identity of the inducing cofactor for Mlc is resolved , it is not possible to say categorically that the glucose induction of ptsG is mediated directly by the Mlc repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Discussion Does Mlc mediate glucose induction of ptsG ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Discussion Comparison of the glucose induction and Mlc repression of ptsH p0 and ptsG Both ptsH and ptsG are transcribed from two promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Cell growth in the presence of glucose 0.1 0.3 0.5 The effect of overexpressed Mlc on cell growth was examined in LB broth supplemented with vari 0 ous quantities of glucose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>The overall expression of ptsH is induced about fourfold by either an mlc mutation or growth-on-glucose ( Table 1A ) and repressed about threefold by the presence of Mlc on a multicopy plasmid ( Table 1B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>The minor ptsG transcript , p2 , is also regulated by Mlc and glucose Inspection of the S1 experiments of Figs 2 and 3 suggested that the intensity of the longer , minor p2 transcript also var-ies according to the growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>S1 and lacZ fusion data show that the ptsG gene is regulated by both growth-on-glucose and the presence of an mlc mutation , and it is tempting to speculate that the regulation by glucose is mediated by the Mlc protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc encodes a homologue of NagC and is responsible for the repression of other PTS operons involved in glucose uptake ( reviewed in Plumbridge , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15066032" target="_blank">15066032</a>]<br></li>
<li>NagC represses nagE , encoding the N-acetylglucosamine-specific transporter , while Mlc represses three PTS operons , ptsG , manXYZ and ptsHIcrr , involved in the uptake of glucose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The free Mlc binds to and represses its target genes , such as those for PTS proteins necessary for glucose transport ( A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The resulting Glc unphosphorylated EIICB binds Mlc and sequesters it from binding to its target promoters , thus derepressing gene expression to make more PTS proteins necessary for the ef ® cient uptake of glucose ( C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>If one of the PTS proteins interacted with Mlc to mediate signal transduction between glucose and Mlc , overproduction of the PTS proteins should increase both their phospho - and dephospho-forms , and result in induction of the expression of Mlc-regulated genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of glucose , PTS proteins are Glc phosphorylated by PEP , and the phospho-form of EIICB does not interact with Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is interesting that NagE ( the N-acetylglucosamine-speciﬁc PTS transporter ) and PtsG , which are closely related EII membrane transporters ( Saier et al. , 1988 ; Postma et al. , 1996 ) , are regulated by homologous repressors , NagC and Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although Mlc did not exhibit any homology to known response-regulators , it might be imagined that PTS-mediated phosphorylation of Mlc would change its activity , since both the repression of several genes by Mlc and the phosphorylation of PTS proteins are dependent on the presence of its sugar substrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to its primary functions in sugar transport and phosphorylation , this complex protein system is involved in regulatory processes such as chemoreception ( Lux et al. , 1995 ) , catabolite repression ( Postma et al. , 1993 ) , carbohydrate transport and metabolism ( Hurley et al. , 1993 ; Postma et al. , 1993 ; Seok et al. , 1997a ) , carbon storage ( Seok et al. , 1997b ; 2001 ; Koo and Seok , 2001 ) , and regulation of Mlc activity to control the expression level of the carbohydrate PTS and related proteins ( Lee et al. , 2000 ; Tanaka et al. , 2000 ; Nam et al. , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16164569" target="_blank">16164569</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , as Mlc shows no homology to any of the known effector components of two-component systems , e.g. OmpR , PhoB , NtrC , this would seem to exclude a classical two-component-type regulatory mechanism .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the possibility that Mlc is phosphorylated by enzyme IICBGlc is low because we could not get any evidence of phosphorylation of Mlc , even though we tried several different approaches employing [ 32P ] phosphoenolpyruvate or [ g-32P ] ATP mixed with purified Mlc in the presence and absence of E. coli cell-free extracts to phosphorylate Mlc ( data not shown ) .

<li>Instead , the upper part of an Mlc dimer makes a simple edge-to-edge contact with the same part of another dimer in the mutant structure .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>We observed a clasping dimer -- dimer contact between two Mlc dimers in complex crystals , which generates a tetramer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>To verify the clasping tetrameric conformation , we designed an Mlc mutant harboring two point mutations ( Arg306Gly and Leu310Gly ) to examine whether the disturbance of the clasping tetrameric contact results in Mlc dimerization .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The investigation of the buried surface area of EIIB in the EIIA/EIIB and Mlc/EIIB complexes clearly shows that 3 , 4 , and the 3 -- 4 turn mainly contribute to the complex formation with Mlc whereas the convexed region composed of the 1 -- 2 turn region ( residues 419 -- 426 ) , the connecting loop between 4 and 3 , and the N-terminus of 3 is mainly implicated in the complex formation with EIIA ( Fig. 2B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Based on the complex structure , we have used surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) spectroscopy to validate the significance of newly identified residues at the complex interface ( Val-449 in the upper contact region and Gln-456 in the lower contact region on EIIB ) for the formation of the stable complex with Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The backbone of residues 448 -- 453 and the side chains of Val-449 and Ala-451 in EIIB form a tight contact with the hydrophobic region of Mlc lined by Ile-132 , Phe-136 , Ile-137 , Leu-143 , Leu-146 , Thr-186 , and Val-188 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the hydrophobic upper contact region , the small side chain of Ala-451 in EIIB and the bulky side chain of Phe-136 in Mlc constitute the best-fitted pair representing a complementary aspect of the contact between the two proteins ( Fig. 2A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The dimerization mode is also identical in the two Mlc structures .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The 45 ° rotational stacking of an Mlc dimer with respect to a contacting dimer allows such a clasping intermolecular contact as and overlapping ( Fig. 1F ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The upper contact region is located in the hydrophobic concaved region of E-domain in Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The lower contact region is located at the boundary between D - and E-do-mains of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is noteworthy that the guanidino group of Arg-424 in EIIB , which was previously identified as a critical residue in binding to Mlc ( 21 ) , is located in the vicinity of the carbonyl oxygen of Leu-146 and the C-terminal carboxylate ¶ in Mlc , indicating multiple polar interactions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previously , it has been reported that the deletion of C-terminal 18 residues leads to Mlc dimerization ( 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consequently , the C-terminal deletion destabilizes the structures of D - and E-domains , and the structural instability of D-and E-domains would remotely affect the structure of O-domain , leading to Mlc dimerization .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is interesting that the DNA region containing the Mlc binding site in E. coli is entirely conserved in the corresponding malT region of Klebsiella pneumoniae , even though the malT -- malP intergenic region has totally diverged between these two organisms ( Bloch and Raibaud , 1986 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , the two regions from positions 132 to 149 and positions 214 to 243 seemed to be essential for the binding of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , as shown in Fig. 3 , the replacement of this residue with aspartic acid or glutamine , respectively , did not affect Mlc binding in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it is highly likely that these residues are directly involved in Mlc binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , as an internal control , we fused Mlc to both different DNA-binding domains of the LexA repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Cells with only one of the two LexA-Mlc hybrid proteins always showed a very high - galactosidase activity , indicating a high speciﬁcity of the different LexA DNA-binding domains for their cognate operator sites ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>An Mlc monomer is composed of three domains playing distinct roles : a DNA-binding domain ( D-domain ) , an EIIB-binding domain ( Edomain ) , and an oligomerization domain ( O-domain ) ( Fig. 1A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The anchoring of four ends to the membrane should significantly restrict the freedom in the domain arrangement of Mlc ( Fig. 4E ) , preventing the essential induced fit of Mlc for DNA-binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been shown that mutations of residues that coordinate a zinc ion in O-domain disturb the DNA-binding activity of Mlc ( 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the loss of DNA-binding activity of the zinc-depleted Mlc mutants indicates that the structural instability of O-domain remotely affects the structure of D-domain in some way .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Fig. 4 , when fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain , both full-length MtfA and MtfA 1-83 , which is missing the amino-terminal part of the protein , are able to interact with Mlc fused to LexA * .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , as revealed by the crystal structure of Mlc ( 37 ) , this carboxy-terminal amphipathic helix stabilizes the amino-terminal helix-turn-helix domain , which is responsible for the DNA-binding of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Crystal structure analysis of E. coli Mlc ( 25 ) revealed the existence of three functional domains : the amino-terminal part containing the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif ( D domain ) , an oligomerization domain from residues 195 to 380 ( O domain ) , and an inner EIIBGlc binding domain ( E domain ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this dimeric conformation , two recognition helices of Mlc are close to each other , which appears to be consistent with an interaction with a palindromic target .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , Mlc efficiently binds to DNA , indicating a rearrangement of HTH motifs in Mlc upon DNA-binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>The innate flexibility at the hinge allows the adjustment of the spatial arrangement of HTH motifs in Mlc to that of major grooves in DNA , conferring the DNA-binding ability of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two linearly located recognition helices with 25-Å center-to-center distance in an Mlc dimer superficially appear to be adequate for their fitting into two tandem major grooves of DNA ( Fig. 4A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to the DNA-complexed structure of BlaI , whose HTH motif is structurally similar to that of Mlc ( SI Fig. 7 ) , however , two recognition helices from two HTH motifs in BlaI , which are in two major grooves of DNA , adopt a different arrangement ; they are parallel to each other with a gap of 30 Å ( Fig. 4A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the detailed interaction between HTH motifs of BlaI and DNA should be different from that between HTH motifs of Mlc and DNA , the DNA complex structure provides insights into the overall arrangement of two recognition helices , which can nestle in DNA major grooves because DNA adopts a common structure regardless of sequences .

<li>( A ) Alignment of the HTH motifs in the N-terminal regions of NagC and Mlc from E.coli and the XylR repressor from Bacillus subtilis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The only candidate amino acids in the HTH of NagC and Mlc that could potentially make a differential interaction with the G/C at positions +11 / -- 11 are at position 10 , at the far end of the recognition helix .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Even though the helix -- turn -- helix motifs of Mlc and NagC are almost identical and both proteins bind to similar sequences , there are distinctions in their operator selection .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>This presumably reflects the fact that the amino acids in positions 1 , 2 and 6 in the recognition helix of the HTH , known to be important for DNA-binding in other HTH proteins ( 27 -- 29 ) , are identical in NagC and Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Surprisingly , the Mlc protein has an almost identical amino acid sequence in the recognition helix of the helix -- turn -- helix motif to that of NagC .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>The homology between NagC and Mlc is particularly intriguing , because the amino acid sequence believed to form the helix -- turn -- helix motif for DNA-binding is almost identical in the two proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>The minimal overlapping of contacting regions in EIIB is a neatly ¶ Very recently , the C-terminal amino acid ( Gly406 ) of Mlc has been revealed to be involved in interacting with EIIB ( 26 ) , which gives experimental support to our observation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , two amino acid substitutions ( L40E and A70D ) in the amino terminus also caused a signiﬁcant reduction in Mlc titration , whereas conserved exchanges at these two positions had no effect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , we characterized the proteolytic activity of puriﬁed MtfA by monitoring cleavage of amino 4-nitroanilide substrates and show Mlc 's ability to enhance this activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc consists of 406 amino acids and its molecular weight is about 44 kDa .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , we could demonstrate that MtfA binds speciﬁcally to the carboxy-terminal segment of Mlc , which is usually involved in protein tetramerization .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>For further characterization of the interaction between the two proteins , we examined the binding of puriﬁed Mlc derivatives with 9 or 18 carboxy-terminal amino acids deleted ( 9C-Mlc and 18C-Mlc , respectively ) ( 39 ) to immobilized YeeI ( Fig. 5B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Deletion of nine carboxy-terminal amino acids ( 9C-Mlc ) did not have a severe effect on the activity , whereas deletion of 18 carboxy-terminal amino acids ( 18C-Mlc ) removed an amphipathic helix that is necessary for tetramerization ( 39 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>In order to further characterize the interaction between MtfA and Mlc , we created a multiple alignment of various MtfA proteins to identify highly conserved amino acid residues that might be of functional importance ( Fig. 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>This might indicate that there are two classes of amino acid substitution that affect Mlc binding : substitutions of the ﬁrst class disturb the overall conformation of MtfA , whereas substitutions of the second class directly affect the MtfA-Mlc interaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results of in vivo phenotyping of the interaction between MtfA and its derivatives with Mlc led to the conclusion that amino acids from residue 132 onward appear to be necessary for this interaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Using systematic site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acid residues in MtfA and subsequent in vivo activity assays , we identiﬁed an Mlc interaction domain within the carboxy-terminal part of MtfA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , the carboxy-terminal part of Mlc seems to be important for this interaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Within the amino-terminal part of the MtfA , only the two substitutions L40E and A70D led to decreased interaction with Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>These may imply that the activity of Mlc is modulated by interaction with an unknown factor probably through protein-protein interaction as in the case of anti-s factors ( 26 , 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>To further characterize the MtfA interaction with Mlc * H86R in vitro , we puriﬁed the super-repressor and used it in an EMSA experiment with the ptsGop fragment .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>This clearly supports the notion that MtfA-Mlc interaction de facto occurs at the C domain of Mlc , which may , in contrast to the EIIBGlc-Mlc interaction , result in either severe changes in the conformation of the D domain or the prevention of repressor oli-gomerization .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , Mlc does not contain the conserved histidine-containing region called a PTS regulation domain ( PRD ) that is the target of the EII-dependent phosphorylation ( StuÈlke et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , after the immobilized EIIB domain was phosphorylated by ¯ owing the mixture of EI , HPr and EIIAGlc in the presence of PEP , and subsequently washed with the running buffer , interaction of Mlc was hardly detectable ( center sensorgram ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the immobilized EIIB domain recovered Mlc binding activity after ¯ owing dephosphorylated EIIAGlc through the ¯ ow cell and ¯ ushing with the running buffer ( Figure 3C , right sensorgram ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylation state-dependent interaction between EIIB and Mlc Real-time interactions of Mlc with the EIIB domain and other soluble PTS proteins were monitored by SPR detection under different conditions using a BIAcore 2000 ( Pharmacia Biosensor AB , Uppsala , Sweden ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The solvent-exposed face of the sheet in EIIB binds mainly to E-domain of Mlc , which confirms that EIIB domain is enough for the interaction with Mlc ( 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results provide direct evidence for the interaction between EIICBGlc and Mlc , and indicate that the EIIB domain of EIICBGlc is suf ® cient for the phosphorylation state-dependent interaction with Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>The soluble EIIB domain is suf ® cient for the phosphorylation state-dependent interaction with Mlc Since the interaction between Mlc and EIICBGlc was only dependent on the phosphorylation state of EIICBGlc , we tested the possibility that the isolated EIIB domain is suf ® cient for the interaction with Mlc in a phosphorylation state-dependent manner .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>

<li>Here we report the crystal structure of a tetrameric Mlc in a complex with four molecules of enzyme IIBGlc ( EIIB ) , the cytoplasmic domain of EIICBGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Each domain structure of one Mlc monomer is virtually identical to that of another monomer in an asymmetric unit .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18319344" target="_blank">18319344</a>]<br></li>
<li>This Mlc * derivative carries an amino acid substitution of histidine 86 to arginine and is unable to bind the unphosphorylated B domain of the EIICBGlc ( 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown previously , the EIIBGlc domain of the glucose transporter is responsible for the interaction with Mlc ( 23 , 39 , 44 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since Mlc can not bind to the EIIBGlc domain in this strain , it can only be inactivated by MtfA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to the domain model , Mlc * H86R can not be inactivated by EIICBGlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>

<li>During transport of glucose and dephosphorylation of EIICBGlc , Mlc binds to the B domain of the transporter , resulting in derepression of several Mlc-regulated genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that the pts operon is one of major targets for the negative regulation by Mlc , and thus Mlc regulates the utilization of various sugars as well as glucose in E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>

<li>In the accompanying paper ( Plumbridge , 1997 ) , it is demonstrated that Mlc has a similar effect on the expression of the manXYZ operon encoding a transporter for several sugars , including glucose , mannose and the amino sugars glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>

<li>The dephos-pho-form of EIICBGlc , resulting from the presence of glucose , can relieve the repression of the Mlc regulon by sequestering Mlc through a direct protein-protein interaction to induce expression of the Mlc regulon including the carbohydrate PTS proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16164569" target="_blank">16164569</a>]<br></li>

<li>Transport of glucose and other PTS sugars induces ptsH and ptsG expression There are several indications , as described above , that Mlc controls genes involved in glucose-metabolism and that growth on glucose seems to generate the inducing signal to relieve Mlc repression of ptsG and ptsH .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Mlc protein ( 44 kDa ) has been shown to act as a repressor for several catabolic operons whose products are linked to sugar metabolism .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>

<li>Mlc is a member of the so-called ROK family of proteins ( Titgemeyer et al. , 1994 ) , which includes NagC , the repressor for the nagE -- BACD operons ( Plumbridge , 1991 ; Plumbridge and Kolb , 1995 ) , and XylR , the repressor of the xylose operons , from a number of Gram-positive bacteria plus certain glucose and fructose kinases .

<li>Mlc shows homology to NagC , a gene regulator functioning as a repressor for the divergent nag operons ( encoding proteins for the uptake and degradation of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine ) and as an activator as well as a repressor for the glmUS operon encoding enzymes for the biosynthesis of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine ( 188 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the sequence of Mlc is ~ 40 % identical to NagC , a repressor and activator of the genes encoding enzymes for amino-sugar-degradation in response to N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate ( Plumbridge , 1998a ) , the possibility that glucose or one of its metabolic intermediates may act as the inducer of Mlc-regulated genes has been considered .

<li>] DISCUSSION Consensus sequences for NagC and Mlc binding sites The consensus sequence for a NagC binding site has been deduced by three methods : ( i ) from the comparison of the native sites ; ( ii ) by mutagenesis of one operator to determine which bases alter regulation ( i.e. on the criteria of NagC binding in vivo ) ; and ( iii ) by the selection of DNA fragments binding NagC in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , inspection of the DNA sequences in the promoter regions of these genes shows no obvious sequences homologous to the known Mlc binding sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>

<li>It has been reported that Mlc regulates manXYZ encoding enzyme II of the mannose PTS ( Plumbridge , 1998 ) , malT encoding the activator of maltose operon and mlc itself , negatively ( Kim et al. , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , it has been shown that Mlc is also involved in the glucose-dependent regulation of the ptsHI crr operon ( 15 , 28 , 42 , 48 ) , the malT gene encoding the transcriptional activator of the maltose regulon ( 7 ) , and the manXYZ operon ( 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>

<li>The implications of this experiment were that the nagE operator , the part of the divergent nagE-B operon system that is known to be controlled by NagC , appeared to have the characteristics of a Mlc operator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc shows homology to NagC , a gene regulator functioning as a repressor for the divergent nag operons ( encoding proteins for the uptake and degradation of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine ) and as an activator as well as a repressor for the glmUS operon encoding enzymes for the biosynthesis of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine ( 188 ) .

<li>It should also be noted that G/C at this position does not exclude Mlc binding ( e.g. M134 ) but , at least in the nagE s.o. case , it does considerably reduce the affinity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>

<li>The simplest explanation of these data is that the pre-sence of glucose has two opposing effects : it induces the ptsG transcript , presumably by leading to the production of the inducing signal for the Mlc protein ( although this has not been demonstrated ) and also represses the transcript resulting from catabolite repression lowering of the cAMP/CAP concentration ( Epstein et al. , 1975 ; Ishizuka et al. , 1994 ; reviewed in Kolb et al. , 1993 ; Saier et al. , Fig. 6 .

<li>Moreover , ptsG encoding enzyme IICB of the glucose PTS ( EIICBGlc ) and the pts operon encoding general PTS proteins also proved to be repressed by Mlc ( 3 , 5 -- 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li></div>
<li>It should be remembered that nagE encodes the GlcNAc-specific PTS transporter and the genes for two other PTS transporters ( ptsG and manXYZ ) plus the genes for the central components of the PTS ( ptsHIcrr ) have been shown to be regulated by Mlc ( 6 -- 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc encodes a homologue of NagC and is responsible for the repression of other PTS operons involved in glucose uptake ( reviewed in Plumbridge , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15066032" target="_blank">15066032</a>]<br></li>

<li>CRP-cAMP action is independent from Mlc The pts operon expression is under the positive control by CRP-cAMP in vivo ( De Reuse & Danchin 1988 ; De Reuse & Danchin 1991 ; De Reuse et al. 1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results also show that , although these sugars are the substrates of the transporter , they are apparently not the inducer of Mlc nor metabolically convertible into the inducer , as their presence does not enhance the expression of the operon .

<li>In this study , a procedure is described for purification of the active form of Mlc to homogeneity , and the effects of Mlc on the expression of the pts P0 promoter were studied to determine whether the in vivo glucose effect on pts operon expression is mediated by Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>The previously observed glucose induction of ptsHI expression prompted an investigation of the effect of Mlc on the expression of these genes encoding the central components of the pts operon , ptsHI .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results also indicated that the action of Mlc in the regulation of the pts operon is dominant over that of CRPzcAMP as proposed for the regulation of ptsG expression by Mlc recently ( 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>

<li>These results suggest that the pts operon is one of major targets for the negative regulation by Mlc , and thus Mlc regulates the utilization of various sugars as well as glucose in E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>This ﬁnding has prompted us to examine whether the stimulation of external glucose of the pts operon transcription is also mediated by Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that the pts transcription is under the negative control of Mlc and that glucose eliminates the Mlc-mediated repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>The minor ptsG transcript , p2 , is also regulated by Mlc and glucose Inspection of the S1 experiments of Figs 2 and 3 suggested that the intensity of the longer , minor p2 transcript also var-ies according to the growth conditions .

<li>Glc As two of these genes are involved in the degradation of glucose , it raises the question of whether these glyco-lytic genes are also controlled by Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>The free Mlc binds to and represses its target genes , such as those for PTS proteins necessary for glucose transport ( A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>A connection to glucose seems to be the common factor in the genes regulated by Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , ptsG transcription is activated by the cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) receptor protein ( CRP ) ( 2 ) , and negative control is exerted by the repressor Mlc , which inhibits ptsG transcription in the absence of glucose ( 3 , 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23873911" target="_blank">23873911</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc is a DNA binding regulatory protein that represses transcription of its target genes , including ptsG , in the absence of glucose ( 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17209026" target="_blank">17209026</a>]<br></li>
<li>The cAMP receptor protein , CRP , is required for activation of ptsG transcription ( De Reuse and Danchin , 1988 ; Fox et al. , 1992 ) , whereas the negative regulatory protein Mlc represses ptsG transcription in the absence of glucose ( Kimata et al. , 1998 ; Plumbridge , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15522088" target="_blank">15522088</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recently , we and others have found that the transcription of ptsG encoding for IICBGlc , a membrane component of the major glucose transporter , is under the negative control by a global repressor Mlc and that glucose induces the ptsG transcription by affecting the Mlc-mediated regulatory pathway ( Kimata et al. 1998 ; Plumbridge 1998b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>CRP-cAMP may activate the P0 transcription by eliminating the Mlc action because CRP-cAMP is required for the expression of ptsG encoding the glucose transporter ( Kimata et al. 1998 ; Plumbridge 1998b ) and therefore glucose is no longer transported via glucose-speciﬁc PTS in the crp cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10469172" target="_blank">10469172</a>]<br></li>
<li>The EIIB domain in the Glc Glc dephosphorylated state ( for instance , in the presence of glucose ) binds the transcription repressor Mlc of the ptsG gene and thereby induces ( activates ) expression of EIICB ( Plumbridge , 1998 , 1999 ; Glc Tanaka et al. , 1999 ; Lee et al. , 2000 ; Nam et al. , 2001 , 2008 ; Seitz et al. , 2003 ; Tanaka et al. , 2004 ) .

<li>Fis either helps Mlc to repress or Crp to activate the ptsG gene transcription , which is decided by the availability of glucose ( Shin et al. 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18368388" target="_blank">18368388</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of ptsG is controlled by Mlc binding to two operators upstream of two promoters , both of which are subject to Mlc repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11139621" target="_blank">11139621</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ptsG gene is expressed from two promoters , p1 and p2 , and controlled by two Mlc operators .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>The lacZ fusion data revealed that expression of ptsG is negatively regulated by ArcA , and this effect is independent of Mlc ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of Mlc-controlled genes seems to be correlated with the presence of nonphosphorylated EIIBC ( encoded by ptsG ) Glc and might be explained by a physical interaction between EIICB and Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Until the identity of the inducing cofactor for Mlc is resolved , it is not possible to say categorically that the glucose induction of ptsG is mediated directly by the Mlc repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Discussion Comparison of the glucose induction and Mlc repression of ptsH p0 and ptsG Both ptsH and ptsG are transcribed from two promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Figures 1 and 4 indicate that ptsG gene expression decreased ( p < 0.05 ) in accordance with the up-regulation of mlc gene expression , while ptsH did not follow such pattern , where ptsH is not under control of Mlc and it was activated partly due to down-regulation of cra gene expression ( Additional file 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19055729" target="_blank">19055729</a>]<br></li>
<li>In that ptsG expression of both EIICBGlc and its negative regulator Mlc was increased by heat shock , it seems that there is another mechanism ( s ) to maintain glucose induction of the Mlc regulon under the heat shock condition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of ptsG Is Increased by Heat Shock and Glucose Induction of ptsG Requires Es32 -- How does the highly increased level of mlc expression in heat-shocked cells affect glucose induction of Mlc regulon ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>The P1 expression of ptsG was increased significantly by heat shock only when cells were grown in the presence of glucose regardless of the presence of Mlc ( Fig. 5A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to induction by glucose and repression by Mlc , mutations in ptsHIcrr , which interrupt the PEP-dependent phosphate transfer through the soluble components of the PTS , lead to high expression of both ptsH and ptsG , while mutations inactivating EIIBC are non-inducible .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , 18C-Mlc can only form dimers that can not repress ptsG expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>What is the inducing signal that displaces Mlc and activates ptsG and ptsH expression ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transport of glucose and other PTS sugars induces ptsH and ptsG expression There are several indications , as described above , that Mlc controls genes involved in glucose metabolism and that growth on glucose seems to generate the inducing signal to relieve Mlc repression of ptsG and ptsH .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>At the moment , it seems likely that growth on glucose is inducing ptsG and ptsH expression by relieving Mlc repression but , in the absence of the identi ® cation of the inducing signal between glucose and Mlc , this remains an assumption .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>The multifactorial inﬂu-ences of RpoS , Mlc , and cAMP on ptsG expression under glucose-limited and anaerobic growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this work , the possibility that the expression of the other glucose transporter , ptsG , is also subject to regulation by Mlc has been investigated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of glucose , ptsG expression is repressed by Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both glucose and mlc induce ptsG expression , strongly suggesting that ptsG is the major target for Mlc regulation and that the inducer ought to be a glucose derivative .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Growth on other PTS sugars , besides glucose , also induces ptsH and ptsG expression , suggesting that the target of Mlc regulation is the PTS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription from both promoters was increased clearly when the mlc : : strain was grown in the absence of glucose ( Fig. 4A , compare lanes 2 and 4 ) , suggesting that Mlc acts as a repressor of the mlc promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>As EIICBGlc is dephosphorylated faster than it can be rephosphorylated by PEP in the presence of glucose , the induced EIICBGlc sequesters more Mlc , forming a positive feedback loop ( D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been known that the acetate accumulation is reduced even when E. coli is grown in the presence of high concentration of glucose if Mlc is overexpressed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>When cells were grown in the absence of glucose , a similar level of expression from both P1 and P2 was observed even though the P2 transcription is more sensitive to Mlc repression probably because the intracellular concentration of Mlc is limiting in E. coli ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>When cells were grown in the presence of glucose promoter , P2 , and that both P1 and P2 transcription is regulated negatively by Mlc ( 3 , 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>Repression of the P2 transcription when cells were grown in the presence of glucose implies that the action of CRPzcAMP is dominant over the self-repression by Mlc in the regulation of the mlc P2 promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test whether the transcription from the upstream ptsH p0 promoter , which has been shown previously to be induced by glucose , is also regulated by Mlc , ptsH mRNA levels were examined in mlc and mlc strains .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>When Mlc is inactivated in the presence of glucose , ptsG transcription is induced .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15650111" target="_blank">15650111</a>]<br></li>
<li>When Mlc was induced and the concentration of CRPzcAMP was lowered by the addition of glucose in the growth medium , the P1 promoter was activated slightly while the P2 promoter was repressed because the P2 promoter is active only in the presence of CRPzcAMP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>One interpretation of this observation is that growth on glucose and the mlc mutation are equivalent , both relieving repression by Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Only P0 is subject to Mlc repression , and the overall expression of ptsH and ptsI is induced about fourfold during growth on glucose ( 28 ) , whereas transcription from the P2 promoter in front of crr is constitutive .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16855233" target="_blank">16855233</a>]<br></li>
<li>The overall expression of ptsH is induced about fourfold by either an mlc mutation or growth on glucose ( Table 1A ) and repressed about threefold by the presence of Mlc on a multicopy plasmid ( Table 1B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>To further test this hypothesis , an allele of ptsG under the control of the constitutive Pbla promoter ( not susceptible to repression by Mlc ) was moved to the PsgrS-lacZ strain , and the mlc clone pBRCV10 was tested in this background .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17209026" target="_blank">17209026</a>]<br></li>
<li>A plasmid carrying the mlc gene expres-sed from its own promoter ( pMlc2 , a gift from S. Ichihara ) produced a 10-fold repression of the manX -- lacZ fusion , while a plasmid in which Mlc was under the control of the lac promoter , pTZ ( Mlc ) , reduced expression of the fusion to less than measurable values ( greater than 100-fold ; Table 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>pMlc2 , in which mlc is expres-sed from its own promoter , represses ptsG expression more than 10-fold , while the pTZ ( Mlc ) plasmid , in which Mlc is expressed from the lac promoter , produces nearly 100-fold repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results imply that ( i ) the DNA upstream of -120 and Mlc do not contribute to the repression of malT expression during growth in basal M M at low pH , and ( ii ) the CAMP-CRP complex is required for the pH , modulation of malT transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>Induction of plasmid-encoded mtfA in both strain backgrounds resulted in high expression of the ptsGop-lacZ fusion , meaning that both wildtype Mlc and Mlc * H86R can be bound and inactivated by MtfA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22178967" target="_blank">22178967</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , overexpression of Mlc from a multicopy plasmid reduces the high level of expression of ptsG ± lacZ in the DptsHIcrr background , although not to such a low level as it does in an mlc strain ( from 90 units to 5 units rather than 0.5 units , cf. Plumbridge , 1998a ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411743" target="_blank">10411743</a>]<br></li>
<li>The transcripts from the plasmid origin of replication ( 106/107 nucleotides ) are marked as rep.

<li>Subsequently , it was demonstrated that the unphosphorylated form of EIICBGlc can relieve the repression of the Mlc regulon by sequestering Mlc through the direct protein-protein interaction to induce the expression of the Mlc regulon including PTS proteins ( 19 -- 21 ) .

<li>It has been shown that the unphosphorylated EIICBGlc can sequester Mlc from its binding sites by direct protein-protein interaction to induce expression of the Mlc regulon in response to glucose ( 9 -- 11 ) .

<li>Although Mlc does bind specifically to both the nagE and nagB operators in vitro , no regulation of nagBE expression in vivo by the natural chromosomal copy of mlc was detected , even in the absence of NagC binding .

<li>When the culture reached an A600 5 0.5 , tryptophan ( 0.1 mg/ml ) was added to induce the expression of Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464268" target="_blank">10464268</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vivo transcrip - tion assays using wild type and mlc strains indicated that the level of mlc expression was modulated less than 2-fold by glucose in the medium with concerted action of CRPzcAMP and Mlc .

<li>In vivo transcription assays using wild type and mlc-negative E. coli strains grown in the presence and absence of glucose indicate that Mlc negatively regulates expression of the P0 promoter , and Mlc-de-pendent repression is relieved by glucose in the growth medium .

<li>In the absence of Mlc , malT expression is increased by a factor of 2-3 when E. coli is grown in glycerol ( Decker et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>

<li>At present , it is not known if expression of the mlc gene is affected by H-NS and/or StpA , but evidently Mlc is subject to autoregulation and represses its own expression ( 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9829919" target="_blank">9829919</a>]<br></li>

<li>In addition , Mlc expression is autoregulated by Mlc itself .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19055729" target="_blank">19055729</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , Mlc expression is autoregulated by Mlc itself and start codon of mlc is GUG .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15916829" target="_blank">15916829</a>]<br></li>
<li>Using a mlc -- lacZ fusion in a mlc and mlcþ background , we found that Mlc represses its own expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc regulates ( represses ) its own expression A mlc -- lacZ fusion was constructed using a plasmid harbouring mlc under the control of its own promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc regulates ( represses ) its own expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mlc not only regulates malT expression but also represses the man operon ( 259 ) when overproduced ( 189 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recently , Decker et al. ( 10 ) discovered that the expression of the malT gene was repressed by a protein named Mlc ( making large colonies [ 20 ] ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9829919" target="_blank">9829919</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Mlc regulator autoregulates transcription of its own gene ( Decker et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11535784" target="_blank">11535784</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of the mal genes is dependent upon the positive transcriptional regulator MalT , and the malT gene is itself negatively regulated by Mlc ( Decker et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9767573" target="_blank">9767573</a>]<br></li>
<li>While Mlc binds well to both operators , NagC is only a weak repressor for mlc and does not repress malT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>A recent report ( 10 ) showed that the transcription of malT is negatively controlled by the mlc gene product and that a loss of Mlc function leads to a threefold increase in malT expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9829919" target="_blank">9829919</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of malT is controlled by a repressor called Mlc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>The mlc gene encoding a 44-kDa Mlc protein is located around 35 min of chromosomal locus ( 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11340070" target="_blank">11340070</a>]<br></li>
<li>Construction of Expression Vector pNS100 and Overexpression of Recombinant Mlc -- The DNA sequence from base 194 to 1490 of the E. coli mlc gene ( GenBankTM accession code D32222 ) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction .
