<li>PduOC is related to HbpS from Streptomyces , but HbpS binds aquo-cobalamin ( H2OCbl ) as well as heme and iron ( Wedderhoff et al. , 2013 ; Ortiz de Orué Lucana et al. , 2014 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27446048" target="_blank">27446048</a>]<br></li>
<li>In Salmonella typhimurium LT2 , four enzymes , CobU , CobS , CobT , and CobC , are responsible for these last steps in AdoCbl biosynthesis [ 2 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15939305" target="_blank">15939305</a>]<br></li>
<li>Bacterial strains were precultured in Luria-Bertani medium , harvested , washed ( 4 × ) with PCN medium ( lacking 1,2-propanediol and CNCbl ) and used to inoculate PCN medium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27446048" target="_blank">27446048</a>]<br></li>
<li>Binding of H2OCbl was also checked by UV/Vis spectroscopy .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27446048" target="_blank">27446048</a>]<br></li>
<li>B , ATP was held at 500 M , whereas the Cbl concentration was varied .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16636051" target="_blank">16636051</a>]<br></li>
<li>Heme and Cbl are iron - and cobalt-based tetrapyrrole macrocycles and cobalamin is found in various forms , such as methyl - , adenosyl - , cyano - , hydroxyl - , and histidyl-cobalamin .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27446048" target="_blank">27446048</a>]<br></li>
<li>A , reaction mixture lacking Cbl ; B , complete reaction mixture containing EutT , ATP , and Cbl ; C and D , PPPi and ATP standards , respectively ; E , mixture of ATP , PPPi , PPi , Pi , and HOCbl standards without EutT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16636051" target="_blank">16636051</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , unlike CobA and PduO , EutT cleaved PPPi to PPi and Pi and cleaved ATP to adenosine and PPPi in the absence of Cbl .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16636051" target="_blank">16636051</a>]<br></li>
<li>Kinetics of ATP and Cbl binding to EutT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16636051" target="_blank">16636051</a>]<br></li>
<li>The spectroscopic data presented above indicate that a unique Co2 + corrinoid species is generated when either Co2 + Cbl or Co2 + Cbi + binds to the CobA/ATP complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>In Escherichia coli , sbp is positively regulated by Cbl , a transcriptional-regulator with 60 % amino acid similarity to CysB , involved in the regulation of cysteine biosynthesis from organic sulfur sources ( Kredich , 1996 ; Stec et al. , 2006 ; Van Der Ploeg et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18957594" target="_blank">18957594</a>]<br></li>
<li>PduX is required for growth under these conditions because it is essential for the conversion of Cby to AdoCbl , a required cofactor for 1,2-PD degradation by S. enterica .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19509296" target="_blank">19509296</a>]<br></li>
<li>Collectively , these findings suggest that AdoCbl does bind to the CobA/ATP complex , albeit without undergoing significant geometric and electronic changes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>A variety of ligands can bind in the `` upper '' axial position ( e.g. , CN - as in CNCbl ) ; however , cobalamin is biologically active only when this position is occupied by a methyl group , as in methyl ¬ ( 1 ) Warren , M. J. ; Raux , E. ; Schubert , H. L. ; Escalante-Semerena , J. C. Nat .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>The search for a direct interaction between Ado-Cbl ( the active repressing form of cobalamin ; Richter-Dahlfors et al. , 1994 ; Roth et al. , 1996 ; Nou and Kadner , 2000 ) and in vitro-transcribed cob or btuB mRNA has thus far yielded few positive results .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11260475" target="_blank">11260475</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of the divergent operons ( cob and pdu ) for cobalamin synthesis and propanediol catabolism is induced by propanediol , but not by ethanolamine ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 43 ) , and the cob operon is repressed by Ado-Cbl ( 33 , 40 , 41 , 57 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17981976" target="_blank">17981976</a>]<br></li>
<li>Cobalamin ( only in the form of Ado-Cbl , coenzyme-B12 ) is known to repress expression of both the cob operon in Salmonella typhimurium and the btuB gene in Escherichia coli and S. typhimurium ( Lundrigan et al. , 1991 ; Richter-Dahlfors and Andersson , 1992 ; Franklund and Kadner , 1997 ; Ravnum and Andersson , 1997 ; Nou and Kadner , 1998 ; 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11260475" target="_blank">11260475</a>]<br></li>
<li>During L. monocytogenes internalization mediated by InlB , PI 3-kinases are activated via recruitment of Gab1 , Cbl , and Shc on phosphotyrosine residues of the intracytoplasmic portion of its receptor Met , a receptor protein tyrosine kinase ( 23 , 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210834" target="_blank">22210834</a>]<br></li>
<li>Specifically , MCD spectroscopy has been used to probe changes in the Co2 + ligand field ( LF , dfd ) transition energies upon binding of Co2 + Cbl and Co2 + - cobinamide ( Co2 + Cbi + , Figure 1 ) to the CobA active site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>Order-of-addition experiments revealed a modest increase in the specific activity of the enzyme ( 17 % ) when it was incubated with ATP first ( specific activity of 42 versus 36 nmol of AdoCbl min 1 mg 1 of protein ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16636051" target="_blank">16636051</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although activity was detectable , it was 1 % of the activity meas-ured when Ti ( III ) citrate was used to reduce EutT ( specific activity of 0.49 versus 61 nmol of AdoCbl min 1 mg 1 of protein ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16636051" target="_blank">16636051</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interaction between EutTWT/Co and AdoCbl The low-temperature Abs , CD , and MCD spectra of AdoCbl in the presence of EutTWT/Co are shown in Figure 5 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28045498" target="_blank">28045498</a>]<br></li>
<li>Abs , CD , and MCD spectra of free AdoCbl and AdoCbl in the presence of ATP-bound CobA are presented in Figure 7 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , both homologues of Tcf , i.e. Cbl and CFA/I , were also shown to be repressed by iron ( Karjalainen et al. , 1991 ; Tomich & Mohr , 2004 ) , suggesting the involvement of the iron regulator Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26944792" target="_blank">26944792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , pduX is used for AdoCbl synthesis even in the absence of 1,2-PD , which is required for transcription of the pdu operon ( 15 , 17 , 26 , 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18308727" target="_blank">18308727</a>]<br></li>
<li>Additionally , CobA is responsible for maintaining a basal concentration of AdoCbl to promote transcription of the eut operon that encodes proteins needed for the catabolism of ethanolamine .12,13 Included among the eut proteins is EutT , a presumably Fe-S cluster-containing adenosyltransferase12 that provides a ready supply of adenosy ¬ ( 8 ) Dobson , C. M. ; Wai , T. ; Leclerc , D. ; Kadir , H. ; Narang , M. ; Lerner-Ellis , J. P. ; Hudson , T. J. ; Rosenblatt , D. S. ; Gravel , R. A. Hum .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>AdoCbl was not detected when the membrane fraction of the cobA eutT strain ( JE7180 ) was added to purified CHAPS-EutT protein , suggesting that , in the presence of detergent , factors that allow EutT function no longer interact with EutT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16636051" target="_blank">16636051</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the basis of these assignments , changes in spectral features upon corrinoid binding to CobA can be analyzed in terms of molecular perturbations so as to determine possible modes of activation 2 + of Co Cbl for further reduction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our EPR data indicate that in the presence of EutTWT and substoichiometric MgATP , as much as 60 % of Co ( II ) Cbl is present in the baseoff conformation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26886077" target="_blank">26886077</a>]<br></li>
<li>Intriguingly , in the presence of EutTWT/Zn and half-molar to equimolar amounts of MgATP , the EPR spectra lack any features from base-on Co ( II ) Cbl ( Figures 4 and 5 , C and D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26886077" target="_blank">26886077</a>]<br></li>

<li>Intriguingly , our spectroscopic data also reveal the presence of an equilibrium between five-coordinate `` base-on '' and `` base-off '' Co ( II ) Cbl species bound to the EutT active site at low ATP concentrations , which shifts in favor of `` base-off '' Co ( II ) Cbl in the presence of excess ATP , suggesting that the base-off species serves as a precursor to 4c Co ( II ) Cbl .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26886077" target="_blank">26886077</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is in stark contrast to the ordered binding scheme observed for SeCobA and LrPduO , where ATP must bind first for the enzyme to adopt a conformation suitable for binding of Co ( II ) rrinoids ( Figure 8 , A ) .3,33,34 However , 4c Co ( II ) Cbl is generated only in the presence of an excess of co-susbtrate MgATP , with higher concentrations resulting in higher yields .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26886077" target="_blank">26886077</a>]<br></li>
<li>Various electron donors were tested for the ability to allow AdoCbl production as a function of the presence of unresolved lysate , cob ( III ) alamin , ATP , and Mn2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16636051" target="_blank">16636051</a>]<br></li>
<li>While the results described above are not conclusive as to whether Co3 + corrinoids actually bind to the CobA active site , the small but notable spectral changes observed upon the addition of ATP-bound CobA to a solution of AdoCbl ( Figure 7 ) indicate that CobA does indeed interact with Co3 + corrinoids .

<li>As this feature is not present in the MCD spectrum of free Co2 + Cbi + ( Figure 5A ) , the spectral changes that accompany binding of Co2 + Cbl to CobA can not be rationalized solely in terms of a protein-induced replacement of the DMB with a water molecule ( a scenario uncovered recently for hATR ) .64 When substrate-free CobA is treated with Co2 + Cbi + , the same unique paramagnetic species is formed , albeit in greater yield ( Figure 5B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , however , a modest ( ∼ 12 % ) increase in the yield of HOCbl conversion to Co2 + Cbl is observed when co-substrate ATP is present in the CobA active site , suggesting that the CobA/ATP complex has a higher affinity for Co2 + Cbl and/or raises the Co3 + / 2 + reduction potential relative to the ATP-free form of the enzyme .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>One possible strategy for activating enzyme-bound Co2 + Cbl would involve replacing the axial DMB ligand ( Figure 1 ) with a weaker donor to stabilize the redox-active Co dz2-based MO ; for example , DMBfH2O substitution is expected ∼ to raise E ° by 120 mV , corresponding to the difference in reduction potentials of Co2 + Cbl and Co2 + Cbi + ( E ° ) -490 mV ) .17 However , the crystal structure of HOCbl bound to the CobA/ATP complex suggests that no such axial substitution actually occurs .9 Likewise , our data conclusively demonstrate that when Co2 + Cbl binds to CobA , it retains the DMB lower axial ligand ( Figures 4C and 6C ) .

<li>Upon the addition of a buffered solution of CobA , the Abs + R spectrum of H2OCbl changes significantly ; both the - and γ-bands decrease in intensity and red-shift by 400 and 470 cm-1 , respectively ( cf.

<li>Abs and CD spectra of H2OCbl + in the presence of CobA ( Figures 3D and S2 ) are different from those of unbound H2OCbl + ( Figures 3A and S1 ) , yet similar to those of free HOCbl ( Figures 3B and S1 ) , as expected considering that the protein-containing sample was sufficiently basic ( pH 8.0 ) to promote deprotonation of the upper axial H2O ligand of H + 2OCbl ( pKa of 7.6 ) .41 The only notable difference between the H2OCbl + / CobA and unbound HOCbl data sets is the presence of an additional feature at ∼ 21 100 cm-1 in the former , attributed to base-on Co2 + Cbl on the basis of corresponding MCD data ( cf. Figures 4A and S2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase ( EAL ) 1 , 2 is a 5 ' - deoxyadenosylcobalamin ( AdoCbl ; coenzyme B12 ; Scheme 1 ) -- dependent bacterial enzyme [ EC 4.3.1.7 ; cobalamin ( vitamin B12 ) - dependent enzyme superfamily3 ] ,4 -6 that catalyzes the deamination of the short-chain vicinal amino alcohols , aminoethanol and [ S ] - and [ R ] -2 - aminopropanol .7 The coding sequence for EAL is located on the 17-gene eut operon8 which contains coding regions for the proteins required for bacterial utilization of ethanolamine as a carbon and nitrogen source , in the presence of exogenous AdoCbl.9-11 Studies of the eut metabolosome suborganellar structure have focused on molecular understanding of the hierarchical assembly ,12 and the complex chemistry that is involved in ethanolamine processing .13 Ethanolamine utilization has been identified as a key competitive advantage for colonization of the mammalian gut by bacterial pathogens , and ethanolamine can serve as a trigger for virulence .14 , 15 A strong correlation has been found between food-poisoning bacteria and the presence of eut genes .16 * Corresponding Author : Kurt Warncke , Department of Physics , N201 Mathematics and Science Center , 400 Dowman Drive , Emory University , Atlanta , Georgia 30322-2430 , kwarncke@physics.emory.edu, Phone : 404-727-2975 , Fax : 404-727-0873 .

<li>ATP Binding and By-products of EutT Are Different from Those of Other Adenosyltransferases -- From the work reported here , we have learned that the EutT enzyme requires the amino group of adenine and the - phosphate for ATP binding and that the enzyme cleaves ATP to PPPi and adenosine when Cbl is absent from the active site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16636051" target="_blank">16636051</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similar spectral changes were observed upon binding of AdoCbl to apo-MMCM , results that were attributed to the imposition of a strict conformation on the Ado moiety and a 21 decreased local dielectric constant in the enzyme active site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the energies of these features , the so-called α / β-bands , are highly sensitive to changes in the axial ligation , our spectra are consistent with an essentially unperturbed ligand environment of AdoCbl in the presence of EutTWT/Co and minimal MgATP ( < 10 µM ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28045498" target="_blank">28045498</a>]<br></li>
<li>This finding indicates that a large fraction of AdoCbl is bound to EutT , despite the lack of changes observed in our spectra of AdoCbl upon the addition of EutTWT/Co .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28045498" target="_blank">28045498</a>]<br></li>

<li>However , these spectral changes can be attributed primarily to deprotonation of the cobalamin to yield HOCbl ( cf. Figure 3B ) , as the protein solution was buffered to a pH of 8.0 while the pKa of the water ligand of + 41 free H2OCbl is 7.6 .

<li>It has been shown that Flavodoxin A ( FldA ) is a flavin mononucleotide ( FMN ) - dependent electrontransferase that serves as the terminal member of a system of enzymes designed to harness the reducing power of NADH and is capable of providing the electron required for the Co2 + fCo1 + reduction in the CobA active site ( Figure 2 ) .65 A most intriguing aspect of this reaction is that the one-electron reduction of free Co2 + - Cbl is physiologically unfeasible , as the corresponding midpoint potential ( E ° ) -610 mV vs SHE ) 17 is much lower than that of FldA ( E ° ) -440 mV for the semiquinone/reduced FMN couple18 ) ; therefore , for this reduction to become thermodynamically favorable , CobA must suitably activate the corrinoid substrate .

<li>Similar to the case of Co3 + corrinoids , the energy of the R-band transition of Co2 + corrinoids ( involving the same pair of cor π / π * - based donor and acceptor MOs as the R-band transition of Co3 + corrinoids ) is also sensitive to the identity of the lower ligand , undergoing a 150 cm-1 blue-shift upon substitution of the DMB ligand of Co2 + Cbl with a water molecule to yield Co2 + Cbi + ( cf. Figures 4A and 5A ) .20 Both Co2 + Cbl and Co2 + - Cbi + are paramagnetic ( S ) 1 / ) species and give rise to richly 2 structured , temperature-dependent MCD spectra .

<li>Discussion Considerable research effort has been directed toward elucidating the geometric and electronic factors contributing to the remarkable activation of the Co-C bond of AdoCbl ( Figure 1 ) for homolysis by B - dependent enzymes.57-62 12 In contrast , the biological formation of this unique organometallic bond that lies at the heart of the reactivity of the coenzyme B12 has attracted relatively little attention .12,22,63 In this study , we have built upon the foundation established in our earlier characterization of free Co3 + - and Co2 + corrinoids to analyze changes in Abs and MCD spectroscopic data of physiologically relevant precursors of AdoCbl as they interact with the bacterial adenosyltransferase CobA .

<li>These so-called eut metabolosomes are postulated to encapsulate the metabolic machinery employed by the cell for the catabolism of ethanolamine .12,13 The ability of S. enterica to the use ethanolamine as a source of nutrition was suggested to provide this bacterium with a growth advantage over other intestinal flora under inflammatory conditions ,14 as ethanolamine is readily available in the mammalian gut .11,15 In this metabolic pathway , the AdoCbl-dependent ethanolamine ammonia lyase ( EAL ) enzyme ( the product of the eutB and eutC genes ) catalyzes the conversion of ethanolamine to acetaldehyde and ammonia .16 EutT has been postulated to supply the levels of AdoCbl required for EAL to perform this function .2,17 Notably , the presence of eutT genes was observed to correlate with higher incidence of gastroenteritis .18 In addition to EutT , two non-homologous ACATs are present in S. enterica .3 The SeCobA ACAT is continuously produced to maintain basal concentrations of AdoCbl and is involved in the de novo synthesis of AdoCbl and in the scavenging of incomplete corrinoids .19,20 The gene encoding for SePduO is part of the pdu operon that allows S. enterica to utilize 1,2-propanediol as a source of carbon and energy .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26886077" target="_blank">26886077</a>]<br></li>
<li>This result suggests that the presence of ATP in the CobA active site has little effect on the electronic structure of the bound Co3 + corrinoid substrate + or that H2OCbl does not actually bind to the enzyme .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>The increase in Co − N ( DMB ) bond strength estimated from our results is consistent with the 40-fold decrease in KM values previously observed for the binding of AdoCbl to MMCM ( which binds AdoCbl in a base-off , His-on fashion ) 3 relative to hATR ( which excludes the binding of axial ligands to the Coα face of the corrin ring where the DMB group would usually be found ) .21,37,62 However , this difference is not constant across the entire series of SeCobA variants investigated , because speciﬁc , species-dependent intermolecular interactions between the protein side chains and the DMB moiety are likely important for promoting Co − N ( DMB ) bond dissociation ( vide supra ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25423616" target="_blank">25423616</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the basis of the close resemblance of the corresponding MCD spectra ( Figure 4 ) , the geometric and electronic structures of Co2 + Cbl are not significantly perturbed when this species binds to CobA , indicating that the lower ligand coordination by DMB is maintained in the enzyme active site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nearly complete conversion to this `` activated '' species is achieved when the physiologically more relevant substrate Co2 + Cbi + is used instead , presumably because the corresponding Co-OH2 bond is weaker than the Co-DMB bond in Co2 + Cbl .20 On the basis of our spectro/structural correlation , the lengthening of the lower ligand bond by ∼ 0.3 Å , in the activated Co2 + corrinoid species ( vide supra ) , results in a 0.266 eV stabilization of the Co 3dz2-based redox-active MO. .

<li>The presence of partially resolved hyperfine structure on the 2620 G feature suggests that the enzyme active site imposes conformational constraints on the Co ( II ) Cbl substrate even in the absence of MgATP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26886077" target="_blank">26886077</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , in the MCD spectrum of Co ( II ) Cbl with the SeCobAW93F/ATP complex , the intensity of the δ-band is decreased 4-fold from that observed in the presence of SeCobAWT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25423616" target="_blank">25423616</a>]<br></li>
<li>This feature is reminiscent of 2 + the R-band of Co corrinoids ( vide infra ) , suggesting that the presence of 20 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) in the buffer caused 2 + partial reduction of the corrinoid to Co Cbl .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15954777" target="_blank">15954777</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the decreased yield of 4c Co ( II ) Cbl species in SeCobAW93F can be attributed to the smaller size of the introduced Phe residue relative to the native Trp , which leads to a decreased level of steric crowding when Co ( II ) Cbl binds to the enzyme active site in the DMB-on form .30 Because of the weaker interaction of the H2O ligand with the Co ( II ) ion in Co ( II ) Cbi + , the decreased level of steric crowding in the active site of SeCobAW93F has a smaller effect on the 4c − 5c equilibrium when this species is used as the substrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25423616" target="_blank">25423616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although previous studies revealed that Co ( II ) Cbi + does bind to the EutTWT active site , albeit weakly , the axially bound water ligand is retained in this process .41 C o m p a ris o n The results obtained in the present study indicate that binding of Co ( II ) Cbl to the EutTWT active site and the formation of a large population of a 5c base-off species occur even in the absence of MgATP .

<li>Further changes in the relative intensities and bandwidths of features that occur in this region of the MCD spectrum provide additional evidence that a significant fraction of Co ( II ) Cbl binds to the EutTWT/Fe active site in the absence of co-substrate MgATP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26886077" target="_blank">26886077</a>]<br></li>
<li>The presence of sharp features in the 3000 G region of the EPR spectrum suggests that the DMB moiety of base-on Co ( II ) Cbl is conformationally constrained and thus bound to the active site EutTWT/Fe , as these features are absent in the EPR spectrum of free Co ( II ) Cbl and can not be attributed to the presence of base-off Co ( II ) Cbl ( vide infra ) .

<li>Initial atomic coordinates for the structure of wild-type SeCobA in complex with ATP and Co ( II ) Cbl were obtained from the most recently published crystal structure [ Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) entry 4HUT ] .34 Pymol was used to introduce in silico amino acid substitutions into the SeCobA subunit containing 4c Co ( II ) Cbl and ATP .

<li>As the nearby F91 side chain is properly positioned to participate in a π-stacking interaction with residue W93 in the `` open '' conformation , substitution of F91 would be expected to introduce further perturbations into the Co − N ( DMB ) bond of enzyme-bound Co ( II ) Cbl , consistent with our MCD data .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25423616" target="_blank">25423616</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the most recent crystal structure of SeCobAWT with Co ( II ) Cbl and MgATP bound shows instead that a nearby phenylalanine ( F91 ) residue is positioned on the face of the corrin ring where the DMB group is usually found .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25423616" target="_blank">25423616</a>]<br></li>
<li>This ﬁnding is consistent with the crystal structure of SeCobAWT , which revealed that in the `` open '' conformation , residue W93 is spatially very close to the ribose moiety that makes up part of the nucleotide loop of Co ( II ) Cbl .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25423616" target="_blank">25423616</a>]<br></li>
<li>A comparison of the `` open '' and `` closed '' conformations observed in the crystal structure of SeCobAWT complexed with Co ( II ) Cbl and MgATP reveals only minor differences in the vicinity of the Coβ face of the corrin ring that is oriented toward cosubstrate ATP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25423616" target="_blank">25423616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Though electron density associated with the DMB was not observed in these crystal structures , the intermolecular loop that connects this moiety to the corrin ring was found to be oriented away from the active site .11,15 Spectroscopic characterization of enzyme variants revealed that the driving force for the displacement of the DMB ligand is provided by the formation of favorable interactions among active site residues when 4c Co ( II ) Cbl is generated .16,17 Although the three-dimensional structure of EutT is currently unavailable , the primary sequence of this class of enzymes contains a partially conserved HX11CCX2C ( 83 ) motif ( where H and the last C occupy the 67th and 83rd positions , respectively , in the amino acid sequence ) that has no counterpart in the other known ACAT families .

<li>Notably , this structure revealed the active-site geometry at the catalytic site containing 4c Co ( II ) Cbl species ( the `` closed '' conformation ) , as well as the binding geometry of pentacoordinate ( 5c ) Co ( II ) Cbl prior to enzyme activation ( the `` open '' conformation ) .32 It also conﬁrmed the unique binding motif of ATP ,36 oriented toward the corrin ring for nucleophilic attack by the Co ion , and identiﬁed additional amino acid residues responsible for displacing the lower axial ligand of the bound corrinoid in the `` closed '' conformation of the enzyme .

<li>The most recently reported crystal structure of SeCobA in the presence of Co ( II ) Cbl and MgATP indicates that residues W93 and F91 , which are critical for 4c Co ( II ) rrinoid formation in the active site of SeCobAWT , remain partially solvent exposed in the `` closed '' conformation ( Figure 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25423616" target="_blank">25423616</a>]<br></li>
<li>As metal incorporation is known to be critical for the formation of 4c Co ( II ) Cbl species , the decrease in the specific activity of EutTWT/Co most likely stems from incomplete Co ( II ) binding to the divalent metal site , rather than the formation of a perturbed , non-competent active site geometry in the presence of Co ( II ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28045498" target="_blank">28045498</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent kinetic and spectroscopic studies of this enzyme revealed that residues in the HX11CCX2C ( 83 ) motif are required for the tight binding of the divalent metal ion and are critical for the formation of a four-coordinate ( 4c ) cob ( II ) alamin [ Co ( II ) Cbl ] intermediate in the catalytic cycle .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=28045498" target="_blank">28045498</a>]<br></li>
<li>While the specific amino acid residues used to stabilize enzyme-bound 5c base-off and 4c Co ( II ) Cbl species remain unknown in the absence of a crystal structure of EutT , it is tempting to speculate that the divalent metal site and HX11CCX2C ( 83 ) motifs are involved in the removal of the DMB moiety , and thus are important for 4c Co ( II ) Cbl formation .

<li>The CbiX cobaltochetalase from Bacillus megaterium , which participates in the biosynthesis of AdoCbl via insertion of cobalt into a sirohydrochlorin precursor , was shown to contain a 4Fe/4S cluster , although the physiological role of this motif remains unknown .50 Alternatively , corrinoid iron-sulfur proteins ( CoFeSPs ) , which catalyze methyl-transfer reactions , are known to employ a 4Fe/4S cluster for the reactivation of their bound cobalamin cofactor following the occasional oxidation of the Co ( I ) Cbl intermediate during turnover .51,52 Finally , recent crystal structures of the AdoCbl-dependent reductive dehalogenases PceA from Sulforospirillum multivorans and NprdhA from Nitratireductor pacificus revealed two 4Fe/4S clusters ~ 8 Å and ~ 12 Å away from the Co center of the corrinoid cofactor .

<li>Speciﬁcally , it was found that a noncoordinating Phe residue occupies the lower axial position of the Co ( II ) Cbl cofactor where the DMB ligand would normally be found ( F112 in LrPudO33 and F91 in SeCobA34 ) .

<li>Involvement of CysB and Cbl regulatory proteins in expression of the tauABCD operon and other sulfate starvation-inducible genes in Escherichia coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18957594" target="_blank">18957594</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of the divergent operons ( cob and pdu ) for cobalamin synthesis and propanediol catabolism is induced by propanediol , but not by ethanolamine ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 43 ) , and the cob operon is repressed by Ado-Cbl ( 33 , 40 , 41 , 57 ) .
