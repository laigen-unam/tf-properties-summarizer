<li>From these results , we infer that the 39 boundary of the SoxS activation site lies between positions 247 and 242 , as deﬁned by Z1K and Z1KD1 , or possibly between Z1K and Z1KD2 if the helical phasing of the regulatory element is critical to its function .

<li>The predicted SoxR and SoxS proteins are each related to a distinct family of bacterial regulatory proteins that control responses to environmental change , and may act sequentially to activate the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results clearly indicate that SoxS binds to the reversed soxbox sequence in the ribA gene , while in other known genes of the soxRS regulon it binds to the normally oriented soxbox .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10102373" target="_blank">10102373</a>]<br></li>
<li>The SoxS protein stimulates a group of genes whose products defend against oxidative damage ( for example , superoxide dismutase ) and it can mediate resistance to diverse antibiotics and organic solvents3 .

<li>The puri ® ed SoxS and the MalE-SoxS fusion protein have been shown to-bind speci ® cally to various promoters in the soxRS regulon and to activate transcription in vitro ( Fawcett and Wolf 1994 ; Li and Demple 1994 ; Jair et al. 1996 ) .

<li>When oxidized , SoxR activates the transcription of soxS , and the resulting SoxS protein activates genes that collectively help to avoid or repair the damage caused by oxidants ( 13 , 18 , 19 ) .

<li>Induction occurs in a two-step cascade : ( i ) SoxR protein that is activated by oxidative-stress induces the transcription of soxS and ( ii ) SoxS protein then activates the transcription of other genes ( 5 , 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>The induction of soxRS regulon genes ( sodA , nfo , zwf , and micF ) in cells expressing high levels of SoxS and in the absence of SoxR protein or a redox stimulus ( 1 ) is consistent with this model , although direct activation of other genes ( e.g. , soi-28 ) by SoxR has not been ruled out .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon activation , SoxR induces expression of the soxS gene in response to superoxide-generating agents , and then SoxS activates transcription of genes within the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16760308" target="_blank">16760308</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regulation of the acnA and fum gene expression by SoxRS The soxRS oxidative-stress regulon responds to superoxide-generating agents such as methyl viologen , by a two-stage process in which the SoxR protein is thought to serve as a redox-sensing activator of the adjacent so.xS gene , followed in turn by the activation of regulon genes bv the SoxS protein ( Amabile-Cuevas & Demple , 1991 ; Hildago & Demple , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>A two-stage control system was hypothesized for soxRS , in which an intracellular redox signal would trigger the SoxR protein as a transcriptional-activator of the soxS gene and the resulting increased levels of SoxS protein would activate transcription of the various soxRS regulon genes ( B. Demple and C. F. Amaibile Cuevas , Cell 67:837 -839 , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results support the hypothesis of two-stage regulation ( 7 ) , in which the redox-activated SoxR protein binds the soxS promoter to activate transcription and the elevated levels of SoxS protein induce the various soxRS regulon genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>The activity of the SoxS protein is regulated exclusively by its intracellular concentration , and thus the artiﬁcial induction of soxS expression from pJP105 should be sufﬁcient to modulate all genes of the soxRS regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>the resulting elevated level of SoxS protein then activates the various soxRS regulon genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9093389" target="_blank">9093389</a>]<br></li>
<li>The elevated expression of the SoxS protein alone is sufficient to activate its target genes of the soxRS regulon in the absence of a redox stress signal ( 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8282690" target="_blank">8282690</a>]<br></li>
<li>The primary basis of these effects is because of small differences in the binding afﬁnities of the proteins to the DNA , particularly to the binding sequences termed sox-box , when SoxS is the primary activator , or marbox , when all three activators can bind and activate the downstream genes ( Fawcett & Wolf , 1995 ; Martin et al. , 2000 ; Martin & Rosner , 2011 ) .

<li>The protein purified frcm the amylose column was inferred to be MalE-SoxS from its apparent molecular weight in SDS-PAGE and the presence of a factor Xa-cleavage site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>This could be due to the presence of multiple binding sites , as suggested for micF and zwf promoters ( Li and Demple 1996 ) , or to cooperative , non-speci ® c binding of SoxS to nearby DNA sites The SoxS-binding region was then localized by DNase I protection analysis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10102373" target="_blank">10102373</a>]<br></li>
<li>The lower afﬁnity of native SoxS protein for its speciﬁc DNA targets ( KD values ~ 10 -- 9 M ; Li and Demple , 1994 , 1996 ) requires higher SoxS concentrations to be reached in order to achieve transcriptional activation of its target genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>As SoxS is known to-bind to promoter regions of target genes under its control , including micF ( Li and Demple , 1994 ) , a simple model would propose that activation of the soxRS or marRAB systems results in increased accumulation of the correspondingproximal activator.The activator then binds to operator regions of similar target genes , some of which encode functions involved in restricting the accumulation of antibiotics ( Ariza ef a / .

<li>After gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions , bands corresponding to the free DNA and the DNA-SoxS protein complexes were excised , and DNA was recovered by the `` crush and soak '' method ( Sambrook et al. 1989 ) .

<li>Interestingly , the proposed SoxS binding site overlaps both with one of the CRP and one of the ArcA binding sites ( Jeong et al. 2004 ) , suggesting the possibility of complex regulation in response to changes in the redox conditions of the cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18368388" target="_blank">18368388</a>]<br></li>
<li>Overlap of the OxyR and SoxS binding sites suggests the possibility of interference between these two proteins under oxidative-stress conditions , particularly in the presence of superoxide which would be dismutated to hydrogen peroxide in the cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11741843" target="_blank">11741843</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whether SoxR regulates fumC and acnA by direct binding to their promoters , when under low iron availability , or through an intermediate other than SoxS , remains to be established .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11470373" target="_blank">11470373</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although specific binding was detected in crude cell extracts , and a partial purification was eftected by chromatography on a heparin agarose column , further purification of the native SoxS protein was foiled by its insolubility .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also , we attribute the decrease in ji-galactosidase activity in the systems programmed with Ihe control plasmids to interference resulting from the non-specific DNA binding of MalE-SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conclude from these results that MalESoxS is functional in vivo and that the presence of its maltose-binding protein moiety does not interfere with SoxS activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because activity is a proxy for concentration of DNA-binding protein , increasingly positive values for SoxS ( Fig. 5e ) imply more activation , which may result from changes in conformation of existing proteins , and/or changes in total concentration of the protein ( due to transcriptional res-ponses ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , genes encoding several transcriptional factors , such as Fur , RcsA , SoxS , and ZraR , are up-regu-lated , and others , such as GadE , GadX , GcvA , and MetR , are down-regu-lated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16418169" target="_blank">16418169</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , since our focus is the transient behaviour of Fur and SoxS , we will not investigate ArcA activity any further .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , SoxS primarily functions as an activator whereas Fur mainly acts to repress genes under its control ( Supplementary Table S2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>

<li>Moreover , when placed upstream of the normally SoxS-unresponsive gnd promoter , this soxbox brought gnd expression under MalE-SoxS control both in vivo and in vitro ( 7 , 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this communication , we wiil demonslcate that the MalE-SoxS fusion protein restores paraquat resistance to a soxRS null mutant and activates expression of zwf in vivo and in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalE-SoxS activates zwf expression in vitio We next examined the ability of purified MalE-SoxS fusion protein to activate expression of a zw ^ ~ / acZ protein fusion in a DNA-dependent in vitro protein synthesis ( 330 ) system .

<li>We used PCR to gene-rate a series of 5 ' and 3 ' deletions of the zivf promoter region fused to iacZaud determined which constructs retained or lost the ability of [ S-galactosidase synthesis to be induced by para-quat in a soxR '' soxS ' strain ; we also brought g/nc/expression under control of SoxS by placing the 21 bp minimal soxbox of zwf immediately upstream of the gnd promoter 's - 35 hexa-mer ( W.

<li>We tested whether the negative effect of soxS + could also be detected when the synthesis of SoxS protein was decoupled from control by SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8226698" target="_blank">8226698</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like SoxS , constitutive expression of the marRAB operon gives enhanced expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase , enzymes that are induced in response to superoxide radical-gen-erating conditions , and also enhanced antibiotic resistance ( 2 , 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7836283" target="_blank">7836283</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , paraquat , which induces SoxS expression ( 14 ) , induced mar transcription twofold only when the marbox and soxRS were present ( Table 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>When exponentially growing cells are treated with para-quat , a superoxide generator , pqi-5 transcription is induced by SoxS which activates transcriptionby EoDholoenzyme .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8899708" target="_blank">8899708</a>]<br></li>
<li>The soxRS operon is induced by oxidative-stress which , via SoxS , leads to direct activation of antibiotic resistance factors , including the marRAB operon ( 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , unlike gnd , zwf expression is transcriptionally activated by SoxS during episodes of oxidative-stress induced by exposure of E. coli to superoxide-generating agents such as paraquat ( 17 , 18 , 39 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896696" target="_blank">7896696</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that the transcription of yggX and mltC , but not that of mutY or nupG , is activated by oxidative-stress and that ectopic expression of the SoxS protein is sufﬁcient to evoke this activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , the oxidative-stress induction of ptsG can be mimicked by ectopic expression of SoxS in the absence of stress , which suggests that SoxS is necessary , and possibly suYcient , for the activation of ptsG under oxidative-stress .

<li>NO has previously been shown to activate expression of genes involved in response to oxidative-stress ; this effect is mediated via the SoxR-SoxS sensor-regulator system ( 35 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8808940" target="_blank">8808940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Post-transcriptional regulation provides a rapid means of down-regu-lation of gene expression .3 In this context , the micF promoter and not the ompF promoter appears to have primarily evolved to respond to stress-related transcription factors such as SoxS .

<li>hmp gene expression in the presence of NOz is independent of the SoxS , OxyR , and FNR transcription factors and instead relies on inactivation of the iron-de-pendent Fur repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852058" target="_blank">9852058</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , we favor the explanation that the regulation of znuCB expression by SoxS is indirect and unique , suggesting several possibilities about the regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>

<li>The strong upregulation of nfnB by the plasmidspeciﬁed MarA observed in this study contrasts with the reported weaker upregulation of NfnB activity and nfnB expression by SoxS ( Liochev et al. , 1999 ; Pomposiello et al. , 2001 ) .

<li>Miller et al. ( 32 ) found increased levels of mar mRNA in a constitutively active soxR mutant and suggested that mar expression may be stimulated by SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , increased soxS levels were reported for NorE5 as was the expression of a truncated form of the SoxR protein leading to constitutive SoxS transcriptional activity ( Fabrega et al. , 2010 ) .

<li>However , the physiological relevance of the increase in soxS expression in strains lacking IscR is questionable as no corresponding increase in SoxS target gene expression was observed in the strain lacking IscR .

<li>When SoxR is activated by oxidation of its [ 2Fe ± 2S ] cluster , it increases the synthesis of SoxS , which then activates its target gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , expression of SoxS from pSXS provided wild-type resistance to nalidixic acid and PMS , and increased levels of Mn-containing SOD , G6PD and endonuclease IV ( Table 2 ; Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>

<li>Presumably , uninduced levels of MarA and/or SoxS mediate a low-level induction of the inaA gene ; the lower basal level of inaA expression in Dmar strains was noted earlier ( Rosner and Slonczewski , 1994 ) .

<li>Although this level of induction is about 50 % of that conferred by the shorter sodA-1 deletion , the fact that the sodA-2 construct is still inducible by paraquat implies that most or all of the sequences required for SoxS transcriptional activation lie downstream of 255 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896696" target="_blank">7896696</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the wild-type background , induction of pqi-5 by paraquat was observed only in the exponential phase , suggesting that SoxS activation of EoSholoenzyme does not occur in the stationary phase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8899708" target="_blank">8899708</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand we observed , like studies of SoxS and the zwf and fpr marboxes ( Grifﬁth and Wolf , 2001 ) , that changes of divergent nucleotides in both RE 1 and RE 2 of the nfnB marbox to nucleotides identical to those in the consensus sequence led to an increase in activation of this promoter .

<li>This is likely due to the greater extent of activation by SoxS of promoters involved in superoxide defense , e.g. , acnA , fpr , zwf , fumC , and sodA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097628" target="_blank">21097628</a>]<br></li>

<li>( 1993 ) provided evidence that SoxS binds in vitro to a DNA fragment containing the soxS promoter , and from these and other data they proposed that SoxS negatively regulates its own synthesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>

<li>Interestingly , SoxS binds to the soxS promoter in vitro and negatively autoregulates expression of soxS ( 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , SoxS might inhibit the expression of its own gene by binding the soxS promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8226698" target="_blank">8226698</a>]<br></li>
<li>This result clearly demonstrated that SoxS is both sufficient and the necessary component to activate the pqi-5 promoter in the presence of Eo '' at the P1 promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8899708" target="_blank">8899708</a>]<br></li>
<li>The binding of puriﬁed SoxS to the yggX promoter strongly suggests that the PQ - and SoxS-medi-ated activation of yggX is the result of direct interaction between promoter and SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>This promoter is the site of SoxRSmediated activation , but the absence of a convincing SoxS binding site ( Li & Demple , 1996 ) upstream of PZaCnAs , uggests that the mode of activation might be indirect .

<li>Lack of induction in pS4X3 places the SoxS activation site either overlapping or just upstream of the ybjC-nfsA promoter identiﬁed by primer extension .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11741843" target="_blank">11741843</a>]<br></li>
<li>This strongly implicates the following chain of events : activation of SoxR by paraquat-generated superoxides activates the synthesis of SoxS , which in turn activates the mar promoter , provided that the mar/soxbox sequences between nt 1339 and 1364 are present .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the activity of the pH3X1 fusion increased an additional 3.6-fold in the presence of paraquat , indicating that this construct contains not only the promoter sequence of nfsA but also the sequences necessary for activation by SoxS .

<li>Moreover , these ﬁndings raise the question of whether the effect of other MDR regulators , such as AcrR , a repressor of acrA , or the MarAhomologs SoxS and Rob , as well as marA orthologs or marAlike regulators in other clinically relevant pathogens , are also subject to this kind of ﬁne-tuned regulation .

<li>) As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , ( i ) that variant E89D is virtually inactive , ( ii ) that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , ( iii ) that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and ( iv ) that SoxS ( V83E ) has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking a T at position 12 .

<li>( ii ) The presence of the marbox renders the operon subject to control by homologous transcriptional-activators such as SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>The similarity of MarA and SoxS with respect to amino acid sequence homology , DNA recognition , and transcriptional activation properties suggests that they arose initially by gene duplication and then diverged to accommodate the constraints mandated by their speciﬁc stimulus-responsive regulatory systems : the salicylate-sensitive negative control mediated by MarR and the superoxide-sensitive positive control mediated by SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , whereas AraC binds as a dimer ( 15 ) to a direct repeat of the ; 17-bp sequence ( 6 , 7 ) , Rob and SoxS bind their targets as monomers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>C. Binding of His6-SoxS and His6-Rob to the same Dig-labelled fragments used in B. Lane 1 , DNA alone ( no protein ) ; lane 2 , 200 nM and lane 3 , 400 nM puriﬁed protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , in comparison to AraC protein , the basis for speciﬁc binding of Rob and SoxS is unclear , especially since a consensus of target sequences is difﬁcult to discern ( 10 , 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the unusual mode of target DNA binding by Rob led us to ask whether the binding of Rob to the robbox of class II promoters occludes the binding of σ70 R4 to the − 35 hexamer as does the binding of SoxS .42 The alternative question is whether the presence of the CTD , the absence of DNA bending , and the absence of RE2 binding by Rob 's C-terminal HTH motif such that the motif is not anchored to the DNA in proximity to σ70 R4 have required that Rob make different protein -- protein interactions with σ70 R4 than SoxS during transcription activation of class II promoters .

<li>The lines underneath show the direct repeats MalE-SoxS fusion proteins activate transcription from the promoter of target genes and can speciﬁcally bind and form multiple DNA-protein complexes thanks to the presence of multiple binding sites at cognate promoters ( 71 , 72 , 151 , 152 ) .

<li>For example , Rob , SoxS , and MarA function as monomers ,18 bind the same but highly degenerate target sequences,18-23 and activate transcription of a common set of ~ 100 genes,16,24-28 by the same , novel prerecruitment/DNA scanning mechanism,11,29-31 although each paralog differentially activates transcription of the target genes .16,32,33 Rob differs from its paralogs in several ways : it is synthesized constitutively34 ,35 rather than in response to an inducing signal , as are SoxS36 and MarA ,37,38 and it contains a CTD .35,39 The CTD is both necessary and sufficient for sequestration -- dispersal ,40 the novel mechanism for turning off and turning on Rob 's ability to function as a transcription activator in the presence or absence , respectively , of an inducing signal , for example , bile salts .37 In addition , the co-crystal structure of Rob bound to the robbox in the micF promoter39 differs significantly from the co-crystal structure of MarA bound to the marbox in the mar promoter .41 ( We note that even though the binding sites for MarA , Rob , and SoxS are the same in a given promoter , the site is given the name of the protein bound there in a specific situation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>In turn , this indicates that Rob and MarA do not bind DNA differently and that in vivo Rob 's CTD does not cause it to-bind robbox DNA differently than MarA binds marbox DNA in vitro41 or than SoxS binds soxbox DNA in vivo .42 We also note that the in vitro binding of Rob , SoxS , and MarA to a robbox/soxbox/marbox bends the DNA by about 30 ° ; 50 however , although mar DNA is bent by about 35 ° in the co-crystal structure with MarA ,41 the micF DNA is straight in the co-crystal structure with Rob .39 In addition , the boundaries of the regions protected from DNase I digestion by the binding of purified Rob or MalE -- SoxS to DNA containing the zwf and fumC promoters were the same ; 50 this would not be the case unless Rob 's C-terminal HTH motif was bound to RE2 of these promoters , as occurs with MalE -- SoxS .51 Together , these data suggest that the absence of DNA binding by helix-6 and the linearity of DNA in the Rob -- micF co-crystal structure do not accurately represent the DNA binding properties of Rob .

<li>Determination of the oligomeric state of Rob and MalE-SoxS proteins as bound to zwf and fumC DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also shown , at the lower right , are the indirect negative effects of SoxS and MarA on OmpF synthesis , mediated by induction of micF , whose RNA product interacts with ompF mRNA to prevent OmpF production .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8866468" target="_blank">8866468</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the increased production of MarA ( caused by some environmental chemicals , such as salicylate , inactivating its cognate repressor , MarR ) or SoxS ( caused by the inactivation of its repressor SoxR via its oxidation ) or the binding of coregulators such as dipyridyl ( 561 ) or some bile salts ( 558 ) to Rob activates the transcription of micF antisense RNA , decreasing OmpF synthesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14665678" target="_blank">14665678</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although we have come a long way in the deﬁnition of the marbox sequence and its relationship with differential regulation by MarA , SoxS and Rob , more work still needs to be done to deﬁne and clarify all the different types of interactions that lead to a coordinated and effective cell response to different environmental stresses .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Unlike MarA or SoxS , Rob is present at a high constitutional level ( estimated to be around 5000 per cell ; Skarstad et al. , 1993 ; Kakeda et al. , 1995 ) , which translates to 2 -- 5 mM , and we are not aware of any experimental study showing that the steady-state level of Rob is altered physiologically in response to environmental signals .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regardless of the detailed mechanism , our present study as well as that of Rosner et al. ( 2002 ) show clearly that regulation via Rob , involving the binding of effector ligands to the regulator protein , is mechanistically very different from regulation via the Mar or Sox system , which involves alteration of the levels of regulator MarA or SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>The plasmids pJLR70 , pRGM9818 , pRGM489 , and pRGM5009 were previously constructed by cloning SoxS , MarA , Rob and MarA E89A , respectively , in the original vector pRGM9817 ( Martin et al. , 2000 ; Rosner et al. , 2002 ; Martin & Rosner , 2011 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , to rule out any possible side effect of PQ treatment , strain M4458b was transformed with the plasmids pRGM9817 , pJLR70 , pRGM9818 , pRGM489 , and pRGM5009 , which respectively correspond to the vector alone or carrying SoxS , MarA , Rob , and MarA E89A ( a modiﬁed MarA protein with the substitution E89A which has been shown to act like SoxS in the preferential activation of the regulon genes ( Martin & Rosner , 2011 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>These derivatives were exposed for 1 h at 328C to salicylate ( SAL ) , to induce MarA , or to paraquat ( PQ ) , to induce SoxS , and assayed for b-galactosidase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10564485" target="_blank">10564485</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the predicted soxbox sequence was deleted , induction by both paraquat and sodium salicylate was completely gone , indicating that MarA and SoxS activation was mediated through the same cis-acting site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19376854" target="_blank">19376854</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since MarA activates some promoters more effectively and SoxS activates others more effectively , we wished to determine what structural differences might account for this promoter discrimination ( 23 ) and whether these differences were related to DNA binding at the corresponding marboxes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097628" target="_blank">21097628</a>]<br></li>
<li>To understand why MarA does not activate certain promoters as strongly as SoxS , we compared MarA , MarA mutants , and SoxS for their abilities to activate 16 promoters and to-bind their cognate marbox binding sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097628" target="_blank">21097628</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , these activators differ in the extents to which they activate particular promoters , for example , SoxS activates fpr to a much greater extent than MarA does .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>When present , the concentration of MarA protein was 67 nM and the concentration of MalE-SoxS fusion protein was 200 nM .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Having previously demonstrated that promoters that respond to MalE-SoxS also respond to MarA ( 18 ) , we tested puriﬁed MarA for its ability to stimulate mar transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Having previously demonstrated that SoxS ( as a MalE-SoxS fusion protein ) and MarA are essentially identical in their abilities to activate in vitro transcription of genes of the sox-mar regulons , we investigated the properties of Rob as a transcriptional-activator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , it would be interesting to purify the MarA , TetD , and Rob proteins and determine their respective abilities to activate in vitro transcription of the fusion constructs , as we have already done with our puriﬁed MalE-SoxS fusion protein ( 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896696" target="_blank">7896696</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , we previously showed that puriﬁed MarA and MalE-SoxS proteins activate zwf transcription by about three - and eightfold , respectively ( 18 , 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since MarA protein is highly homologous to SoxS , and since a MalE-SoxS fusion protein has recently been shown to activate soxRS regulon transcription , the ability of MarA to activate transcription of these genes was tested .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>To determine whether the puriﬁed MarA protein affected gene expression , we tested its ability to activate the in vitro transcription of zwf , sodA , micF , and fumC , genes known to be under mar control in vivo , and of fpr and nfo , genes not known to be regulated by mar in vivo but activated by SoxS in vivo and by MalE-SoxS in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>Miller et al. ( 28 ) have found that SoxS activates mar transcription in vivo , and we have recently found a marbox sequence in the promoter region upstream of marRAB which binds MarA and enables either puriﬁed MalE-SoxS or MarA to activate transcription of marRAB in vitro ( 18 , 26 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>PCR-ampliﬁed DNA fragments were assayed for their abilities to act as templates for in vitro transcription and for the stimulation of transcription by MarA and MalE-SoxS ( Fig. 5 ; Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , in a minimal in vitro system under conditions of both limiting and excess RNA polymerase , both MalE-SoxS and MarA transcriptionally activate the mar promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Puriﬁed MarA and MalE-SoxS proteins stimulated mar transcription about 6 - and 15-fold , respectively , when the RNA polymerase/DNA ratio was 1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>As with MalE-SoxS , MarA enhanced mar transcription only ; 1.3-fold when RNA polymerase was in 10-fold excess ( Fig. 1A ) , but when RNA polymerase was limiting , MarA stimulated mar transcription by 4.1 - to 4.9-fold , or 5.5 - to 6.3-fold when normalized to gnd ( Fig. 1B ; Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Evidence also suggests that the up-regulationof acrAB expression under general stress conditions is not likely to be mediated by the known global regulators , such as MarA or SoxS , although elevated levels of these proteins were shown to increase the transcription of acrAB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Third , unlike the general stress conditions , the constitutive overexpression of MarA or SoxS did not increase the transcription of acrR at all ( D. Ma , unpublished results ) , although it increased the transcription of acrAB , as shown in Table 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although MarA , SoxS and Rob could increase acrAB transcription when they were overexpressed , these gene products did not appear to be responsible for the acrAB induction by the general stress conditions such as 4 % ethanol , 0.5 M NaCl or the onset of stationary-phase growth in LB medium ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>It would be inte-resting to determine under what conditions these acrAB homologues are induced and how they respond to the global stress-induced regulators , including MarA , SoxS and ( possibly ) Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Based on the data presented , we assume that general stress conditions result in the generation of global transcription regulators , which are unlikely to be MarA , SoxS , or Rob , but could be homologues of them .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>If MarA and SoxS were the only proteins capable of activating the mar promoter via the marbox , no difference in activity between wild-type and defective marbox promoters should be seen in strains lacking MarA and uninduced for SoxS ( 27 , 38 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Average stimulation by Fis of mar : : lacZ in the absence or presence of activatorsa Activator Promoter None Rob SoxS MarA Wild type 0.8 1.5 1.5 1.6 Fis site mutants 0.7 0.8 1.0 1.0 Marbox mutants 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.8 a The Fis1-to-Fis2 b-galactosidase ratios in the presence of the indicated marbox activator for each of the three promoter types were averaged and divided by 0.72 , the average Fis1-to-Fis2 ratio for all the strains in the ﬁrst section of Table 4 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both SoxS and MarA activated the promoter by greater than twofold ( Table 5 ) in the absence of Fis ( requiring only a functional marbox to do so ) , and the effects of both were FIG. 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>The b-galactosidase activities show that only when its marbox is in the F-orientation is the zwf promoter activated by MarA or SoxS ( Table 3 , top rows ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10564485" target="_blank">10564485</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similar results were obtained in strains in which SoxS was overproduced or Rob was activated by treatment with DIP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also , the MarA homolog SoxS repressed its own expression in whole cells and bound its own promoter in vitro ( 31 ) ; no further studies of this observation have been reported .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14701822" target="_blank">14701822</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , it is possible that the divergence of the nfnB marbox , and more particularly of RE 2 , although allowing in vitro binding by MarA , SoxS and Rob , will effect discriminated regulation of gene expression by the three transcriptional proteins in a physiological context , i.e. within the cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although puriﬁed SoxS and Rob proteins , like MarA , activated nfnB transcription in vitro , only constitutive expression of chromosomal marA , but not of soxS and rob genes , affected nfnB expression in whole cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Increased expression of nfnB mRNA by plasmid-encoded SoxS and Rob Puriﬁed SoxS and Rob were able to activate nfnB transcription in vitro and bind the nfnB marbox with relatively high afﬁnity even though constitutive chromosomal levels of these proteins did not show a detectable effect on nfnB transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>The consequence is that transcription of the global regulators , MarA and SoxS , are modulated by repression of AcrR at the predicted AcrR binding sequence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25176444" target="_blank">25176444</a>]<br></li>
<li>11 and 13 ) , bile salts , and reactive oxygen species , MarA , in concert with global regulators Rob and SoxS , binds to the mar box sequence to activate transcription of the mar operon ( 14 -- 17 ) .

<li>The signaling mechanisms that prevail in OmpR , MarA , and SoxS action are known .9,10,14 Activation of micF by Rob in response to cationic peptide antibiotics is not as well formulated .32 Transcriptional activators of micF Transcriptional regulators are known to activate micF expression in response to environmental factors ( Figure 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11601842" target="_blank">11601842</a>]<br></li>
<li>The related MarA , SoxS and Rob regulators bind to the same promoter element and activate micF transcription in response to various stimuli , including weak acids , oxidative-stress and certain antibiotics .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17007876" target="_blank">17007876</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of micF is also induced by toxic agents , such as paraquat and weak acids , by the SoxS , MarA , and Rob transcription factors , which bind to the same sequence element in the micF promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15466019" target="_blank">15466019</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Rob homologs MarA and SoxS can activate transcription of a broad range of genes in vivo ( reviewed in references 2 and 14 ) , including sodA , fumC , micF , zwf , and inaA , suggesting broadly overlapping activities of these three regulators .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>Despite their broadly overlapping activities , MarA , SoxS , and Rob differentially activate the transcription of certain genes2 ,5 -- 12 , suggesting that different types of interactions occur with the varied promoter sequences bound by these transcription factors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10802742" target="_blank">10802742</a>]<br></li>
<li>The mechanism by which such small ( 13-kDa ) proteins as SoxS and MarA activate gene expression is unknown .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8282690" target="_blank">8282690</a>]<br></li>
<li>The genes encoding these proteins are activated by the homologous proteins MarA and SoxS , although the level of activation can vary for the different transcription factors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10802742" target="_blank">10802742</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ﬁnding that puriﬁed MarA activates transcription of these promoters in the absence of other factors conﬁrms the in vivo observations that MarA alone , like SoxS , can transcriptionally activate the mar regulon ( 9 , 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , three independently regulated but homologous proteins , MarA , SoxS and Rob , activate a common set of promoters which results in multiple antibiotic resistance , superoxide resistance and organic solvent tolerance ( for review , see Alekshun and Levy , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10564485" target="_blank">10564485</a>]<br></li>
<li>tolC is regulated in part by MarA , SoxS and Rob , three paralogous transcriptional-activators which bind a sequence called the marbox and which activate multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previously , overexpression of Rob was shown to induce multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance phenotypes ( 3 ) , to activate expression of fumC , inaA , and sodA in vivo ( 3 ) , and to activate the transcription of six mar/soxRS regulon promoters in vitro by mechanisms that are strikingly similar to that of MarA and SoxS ( 22 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since SoxS and MarA seem able to activate some of the same genes in vitro , we tested whether intact Rob or its isolated N-terminal 133-residue domain could activate phenotypic antibiotic resistance or speciﬁc genes for antibiotic resistance or oxidative-stress .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>Assays of bgalactosidase due to the expression of micF : : lacZ fusions in strains M3710 and M3944 and inaA : : lacZ fusions in strains M4110 and M4113 showed 19 - , 16 - and 61-fold increases of fusion expression due to the upregulation of MarA , SoxS and Rob respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Different afﬁnities of MarA , SoxS and Rob for the promoters of these genes , probably dictated by differences among these transcription factor recognition sequences , lead to differential regulation of particular promoters by these proteins , therefore allowing the cell to respond differently to various stresses ( Martin et al. , 2000 ; Grifﬁth and Wolf , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>The p1 promoter is not responsive to EvgAS , PhoPQ , MarA , SoxS or Rob but seems to have signiﬁcant constitutive expression under laboratory conditions ( Eguchi et al. , 2003 ; Figs 1 and 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>For instance , Rob has been shown to-bind and activate the zwf promoter in vitro but whole cell zwf regulation can not be activated by Rob , although the gene responds to SoxS and MarA ( Ariza et al. , 1995 ; Jair et al. , 1995 1996a ; b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>This observation is in agreement with reports of others which found that Rob bound in vitro more tightly than MarA and SoxS to most marboxes ( Martin et al. , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA , SoxS and Rob bind as monomers to an asymmetrical and degenerate 19 bp DNA sequence known as the marbox ( Martin et al. , 1999 ; Wood et al. , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , in contrast to SoxS and MarA , whose syntheses are induced by speciﬁc environmental stimuli and elicit a clear defense response , Rob is expressed constitutively and its normal function is unknown .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the E. coli proteins MarA , Rob and SoxS all target genes involved in the oxidative-stress response and bind to closely related DNA sequences .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9813115" target="_blank">9813115</a>]<br></li>
<li>Northern analysis conﬁrmed the transcriptional activation of yggX by oxidative-stress or SoxS expression but not in response to the related MarA or Rob proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , it does not appear that modulation of acrAB expression in response to these environmental stresses operates through AcrR , MarA , or SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8866468" target="_blank">8866468</a>]<br></li>
<li>Many bacteria also possess transcription factors , such as the homologous E. coli regulators MarA , Rob , and SoxS ( 3 , 4 ) , that respond to drugs by activating the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in antibiotic efﬂux and detoxiﬁcation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23010927" target="_blank">23010927</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , expression of acrZ is coregulated with acrAB and tolC by MarA , Rob , and SoxS , a set of transcription factors that regulate cellular responses to antibiotics , detergents , and redox-cycling drugs ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23010927" target="_blank">23010927</a>]<br></li>
<li>For instance , the expression of acrAB in E. coli is controlled by repressor protein AcrR , global activator protein MarA , SoxS , Rob and quorum sensing regulator LuxR homologue protein SdiA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15686558" target="_blank">15686558</a>]<br></li>
<li>We utilized microarray technology to identify genetic loci which differed in expression based on the presence or absence of the MarA , Rob , and SoxS regulators in response to conditions within the host .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the expression of these regulators was not affected by AcrS and AcrR ( data not shown ) , indicating that the acrAB repression by AcrR and AcrS is unlikely to be mediated by MarA , SoxS , or Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18567659" target="_blank">18567659</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is known that acrAB expression is also controlled by the global regulators MarA , SoxS , and Rob ( 4 , 5 , 10 , 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18567659" target="_blank">18567659</a>]<br></li>
<li>Its expression is regulated by three XylS/AraC family regulators , MarA , SoxS and Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although MarA and SoxS regulation works by the alteration of their own expression levels , it was not known how Rob , which is constitutively expressed , exerts its regulatory action .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Unlike MarA , Rob and SoxS upregulated nfnB expression only when they were encoded on multicopy plasmids , but less efﬁciently than MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of nfnB is greatly increased by induced or constitutive chromosomal expression of MarA but is unaltered by constitutive expression of chromosomal SoxS and Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>When expressed from identical plasmid vectors , Rob and SoxS caused increased nfnB expression but it was considerably less than that produced by MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it would be of great interest to understand the interaction of multiple regulators such as SoxS , MarA , and perhaps Rob at single sites that could respond differentially to various environmental signals .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8282690" target="_blank">8282690</a>]<br></li>
<li>Despite the absence of functional MarA , MarR , SoxS , Rob , and EmrRAB , salicylate stimulated the wild-type and mutant promoter activities twofold ( Fig. 5D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Surprisingly , salicylate induced a twofold increase in promoter activity from the lacZ fusions that was independent of sequences from 291 to 232 , of MarA , Rob , and SoxS activators and of MarR and EmrR repressors ( Fig. 5D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the observation that SoxS binds to , and seems to negatively regulate , its own promoter ( 33 ) raises the possibility that MarA and Rob could also negatively regulate soxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>We suggest that rising levels of NADH are the major reasons for the induction of SoxS , MarA and Rob stress responses in the cells lacking TolC .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20545840" target="_blank">20545840</a>]<br></li>
<li>b Rob presence was due to chromosomal wild-type rob expression , SoxS presence was due to paraquat induction of the otherwise quiescent soxRS , and MarA presence was due to plasmid p37 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>‡ Miller units were also determined in the presence of the vector pRGM9817 and fold induction was evaluated in the presence of the vector carrying SoxS , MarA , Rob , and MarA E89A .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>In JA300 , AcrA production was regulated positively by each of the transcriptional-activator proteins , MarA , Rob , and SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9473050" target="_blank">9473050</a>]<br></li>

<li>MarA , SoxS , and Rob each activated the mar promoter 1.5-to 2-fold when it had a wild-type marbox but Fis was absent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of the wild type and all of the mutant promoters tested was reduced approximately 25 % by the presence of Fis in the absence of the transcriptional-activators MarA , SoxS , and Rob ( Table 4 , no marbox activator ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of MarA , SoxS , or Rob , Fis further enhanced the activity of the promoter twofold provided the promoter was also capable of binding Fis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>The mar promoter is regulated by two independent mechanisms , transcriptional activation , depending on Fis and the MarA/Rob/SoxS activators , and repression due to MarR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conclude that transcriptional activation by Fis is dependent on the presence of MarA , SoxS , or Rob at the mar promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , Fis stimulated the transcriptional activation of the promoter by Rob , SoxS , and MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , Fis activation of transcription was totally dependent on the binding of MarA/Rob/SoxS to the marbox .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , activation by Fis is dependent on the presence of MarA or Rob ( or induced levels of SoxS ; see below ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , basal levels of MarA and Rob and induced levels of SoxS independently contribute to transcriptional activation of mar and require a functional marbox for activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Of note , Rob and SoxS also increased transcription in vitro and showed preferential binding to the same nfnB promoter sequence as MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription Studies in Vitro -- To determine whether the binding of MarA/SoxS and Rob to the rob promoter reflected direct repression of the rob promoter , we performed transcription in vitro experiments .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16478729" target="_blank">16478729</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the observation that in vivo zwf transcription can be activated by MarA and SoxS , but not by Rob ( 5 ) , shows that control by these regulators may not overlap completely .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , transcription of marA is activated by MarA and by the MarA homologs SoxS and Rob , mostly in the presence of the helper protein Fis ( 32 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20211899" target="_blank">20211899</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two previously identiﬁed tolC promoters , p1 and p2 , are not regulated by MarA , SoxS or Rob but p2 is activated by EvgAS and PhoPQ which also regulate other functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , both AcrZ -- SPA and AcrB protein levels were elevated when MarA , Rob , or SoxS were overproduced from plasmids ( Fig. 5C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23010927" target="_blank">23010927</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , the synthesis was high in JA300 derivatives in which MarA production was elevated rather than that of Rob and SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9473050" target="_blank">9473050</a>]<br></li>
<li>Binding of MarA , SoxS , and Rob to the rob Promoter -- MarA , SoxS , and Rob bound to the full-length rob promoter ( spanning 234 to 110 ) ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16478729" target="_blank">16478729</a>]<br></li>
<li>Protein-DNA interactions show that SoxS and Rob , like MarA , bind the same marbox in the rob promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16478729" target="_blank">16478729</a>]<br></li>

<li>From an analysis of the promoters that are activated by these proteins , it is clear that the orientation of the marbox and its distance from the -10 hexamer of the promoter are critical in determining whether MarA , SoxS and Rob can activate the promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like MarA , puriﬁed His6-Rob and His6-SoxS bound to marbox 2 in gel mobility assays .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activation by the monomeric proteins MarA , SoxS and Rob requires that they bind to a marbox located in a particular orientation upstream of the TSS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ﬁrst four were greatly enhanced on overexpression of MarA and SoxS ( growth in IPTG ) or on activation of Rob in strain M4113 by DIP whereas the latter two products were diminished .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>The SoxS paralogs MarA and Rob are not sufﬁcient for activation of yggX .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , when we compared the induction mediated by plasmid-speciﬁed SoxS and Rob with that of MarA , a striking difference was noticed ( Fig. 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , when induced by paraquat , the activity of SoxS was not dependent on either MarA or Rob ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>The inaA gene is activated by SoxS , MarA , and Rob , with MarA being the strongest activator ( 34 , 43 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the nfo gene , coding for endonuclease IV , is activated by SoxS but not by MarA or Rob ( 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similarly , the gshB gene , coding for a glutathione synthase , is activated by MarA but not by SoxS or Rob ( 5 , 39 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown here , p3 and p4 are activated by MarA , SoxS and Rob , with each activator being regulated by different environmental signals .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rob is most closely related to the SoxS , MarA , and TetD proteins2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10802742" target="_blank">10802742</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , we chose to pursue znuACB and its relation to MarA , Rob , and SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>The TolC level was regulated positively by MarA , Rob , or SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9473050" target="_blank">9473050</a>]<br></li>
<li>OmpX synthesis is likely to be regulated positively by MarA , Rob , or SoxS ( Fig. 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9473050" target="_blank">9473050</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the extent of Rob activation of each gene was about twofold less than that effected by MalE-SoxS , the concentration of Rob necessary for maximum activation ( ; 33 nM ) was less than that required by MalE-SoxS ( ; 200 nM ) ( 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>This indicates that the marbox is also required for activation of mar by SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>This DNA-binding domain has also been shown to be involved in transcription activation in a number of AraC/XylS family proteins including Ada , RhaS , AraC , MelR , MarA , SoxS , XylS , and UreR ( 1 , 4 , 5 , 15 , 16 , 20 -- 22 , 37 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15342598" target="_blank">15342598</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of this region ( DmarO280 ) , binding of MarA decreased about 30-fold and transcriptional activation by MarA and MalE-SoxS was reduced about 3-fold ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>In fact , as shown here , the in vitro DNA binding , DNA bending , and transcriptional activation properties of Rob are very similar to those of MalE-SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Accordingly , we examined protein -- protein interactions of Rob and RNAP to investigate further the DNA binding and transcriptional activation properties of Rob as compared to SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recently , we demonstrated that activation of in vitro zwf transcription by MalE-SoxS ( 18 ) , and by MarA as well ( 19 ) , requires this same DNA binding element and that this soxbox / marbox can bring in vitro gnd transcription under control of these two activators ( 18 , 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>The report ( 32 ) that overexpression of SoxS induced mar transcription in vivo led us to test for transcriptional activation of mar by puriﬁed MarA and MalE-SoxS proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>We report here the existence of a `` mar/soxbox '' upstream of the 235 hexamer which binds MarA and enables activation of mar transcription by MarA and SoxS both in vitro and in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>

<li>Sufﬁciency of Rob for in vitro transcriptional activation of zwf , fpr , fumC , micF , nfo , and sodA , promoters known to be activated by MalE-SoxS and MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , like MalE-SoxS ( 16 ) , MarA requires the a CTD for activation of zwf transcription but not for activation of fumC and micF .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , as reported here , MarA , SoxS and Rob showed highest afﬁnity for the marbox closer to or overlapping the -35 sequence , which is the primary cis-acting site if not the only , for activation of these genes ( Fawcett and Wolf , 1995 ; Li and Demple , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Despite overlapping regulation by SoxS , MarA , and Rob , the three systems exhibit differential control in terms of both the strength of their effects on individual genes and activation of some promoters uniquely ( e.g. , zwf by SoxS or MarA but not by Rob ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like CAP , MarA , SoxS and Rob are ` ambidextrous ' ( Jair et al. , 1995 , 1996a , 1996b ) : when the marbox is located upstream of the ÿ35 hexamer for RNP binding ( as in the fpr and zwf promoters ) , activation requires interaction with a-CTD ( class I ) ; when the marbox overlaps the ÿ35 hexamer ( as in the fumC , micF and nfo promoters ) , a-CTD is not required for activation ( class II ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10564485" target="_blank">10564485</a>]<br></li>
<li>We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097628" target="_blank">21097628</a>]<br></li>
<li>The basis for the activation of these promoters is the presence of a 20-bp binding site for MarA and SoxS ( the marbox or soxbox ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097628" target="_blank">21097628</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxS ( V83E ) reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS ( V83E ) was still more active than WT MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097628" target="_blank">21097628</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA transcription is controlled by the repressor function of MarR ( encoded within the marRAB operon ; Cohen et al. , 1993 ) , whereas SoxS transcription depends on its activation by SoxR ( encoded within the soxRS region ; Amabile-Cuevas & Demple , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although MarA homologue SoxS was also shown to regulate the transcription of acrAB strongly ( Ma et al. , 1996 ; White et al. , 1997 ) , SoxS , also a small protein of 107 residues , exerts its action by altering the level of its own expression , which is regulated via SoxR by oxidizing agents that generate the superoxide radical ( Greenberg et al. , 1990 ; Ding et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activated SoxR enhances the production of SoxS , a simple transcriptional-activator of the AraC family , which in turn , increases the transcription of the other genes of the regulon ( 4 , 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9030573" target="_blank">9030573</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like MarA , the activity of SoxS seems to be controlled by regulation of its synthesis , which results from transcriptional regulation governed by the redox-sensing SoxR protein ( 2 , 21 , 35 , 45 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although Rob , SoxS and MarA activate micF transcription in response to different environmental stimuli , there is some overlap in response .14 soxS is part of the soxRS regulon .66 SoxR is a sensor protein activated by oxidative-stress and in turn it transcriptionally activates soxS .

<li>With MalE-SoxS , we have demonstrated that activation does not require the CTD of the RNA polymerase s70 subunit at any of the six promoters ( 20 ) and that MalE-SoxS binds DNA as a monomer ( 38 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalESoxS and MarA require the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase a subunit for activation of the zwf promoter but not for the fumC and micF promoters ( 18 , 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activation at these promoters is believed to require interaction between SoxS and C-terminal domain of the - subunit of RNA polymerase ( CTD ) ( 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11741843" target="_blank">11741843</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the former case ( non-class I promoters : fumC , micF , nfo , and sodA ) , SoxS interacts with constituents of RNA polymerase other than the C-terminal domain ( CTD ) of the a subunit , whereas in the latter case ( class I promoters : zwf and fpr ) SoxS interacts with a-CTD to activate transcription ( Jair et al. 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10102373" target="_blank">10102373</a>]<br></li>
<li>With RNA polymerases reconstituted with wild-type or mutant a subunits , SoxS was found to be `` ambidextrous , '' requiring the a C-terminal domain ( CTD ) for transcriptional activation of the zwf and fpr promoters but not the fumC , micF , and nfo promoters ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>In order to verify that YqhC indeed binds to this region , a gel mobility shift assay was carried out with two mutated probes in which 10 residues in the two SoxS consensus sequences were altered ( shown with an inverted triangle in Fig. 5A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20543070" target="_blank">20543070</a>]<br></li>
<li>T h e r e are reports of multiple SoxS b i n d i n g sites in micF , sodA , a n d z w f p r o m o t e r s , where a s e c o n d a r y site further ups t r e a m of the - 3 5 element is occupied in a c o n c e n t r a-t i o n - d e p e n d e n t m a n n e r ( Li a n d D e m p t e 1994 ; F a w c e t t a n d W o l f 1994 ) .

<li>Symbols : l , an amino acid identical to one in SoxS at that position ; : , a functionally similar amino acid ( groups are MILV , YWF , QNED , MILV , PAGST , and HKR ) ; - , a gap of one amino acid introduced for alignment .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1708380" target="_blank">1708380</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the GCAY motif may be a primary recognition elemenf for SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>We therefore took advantage of the two highly conserved marbox `` recognition elements , '' RE1 and RE2 , of 4 bp each which are particularly critical for activation by SoxS ( 27 ) and presumably by MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14701822" target="_blank">14701822</a>]<br></li>
<li>The corresponding residues in SoxS are tyrosine , arginine , valine and arginine , respect-ively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10873449" target="_blank">10873449</a>]<br></li>
<li>The guanine residues in ribA promoter DNA were sparsely methylated with dimethyl sulfate and incubated with 15 nM SoxS protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10102373" target="_blank">10102373</a>]<br></li>
<li>The SoxS protein interacted speci ® - cally with four guanine residues within the soxbox sequence , as demonstrated by methylation interference analysis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10102373" target="_blank">10102373</a>]<br></li>
<li>The positions of free probe ( F ) and various protein-DNA complexes ( C1-3 ) are indicated Recognition of speci ® c residues within the soxbox sequence The speci ® c nucleotide residues recognized by SoxS were probed by methylation interference analysis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10102373" target="_blank">10102373</a>]<br></li>
<li>Puriﬁed near-native MarA and MarR ( each with a single histidine residue N terminal to the native protein ) and the hybrid MalE-SoxS proteins were prepared as previously described ( 9 , 18 , 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>These residues are highly conserved in the MarA homologs , SoxS and Rob , suggesting a common role in overall protein structure or transcriptional activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10873449" target="_blank">10873449</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , these residues are poorly conserved in SoxS and Rob , suggesting a unique interaction between MarA and RNAP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10873449" target="_blank">10873449</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test the importance of the conserved hydrophobic residues identi ® ed as comprising the cores of the two HTH motifs of MarA , alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed on 11 of the 17 amino acid residues implicated in hydrophobic core formation and four additional N-terminal hydrophobic residues conserved among MarA , SoxS and Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10873449" target="_blank">10873449</a>]<br></li>
<li>In previous work ,42 we found that epistatic and non-epistatic interactions between amino acid residues of SoxS and base pairs of soxbox DNA agreed with the predictions based on the co-crystal structure of MarA bound to marbox DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA amino acid residues whose side-chains interact with marbox DNA and are not conserved between Rob and SoxS , all interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone : His43 , Lys49 , Thr97 and Lys99 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10873449" target="_blank">10873449</a>]<br></li>
<li>The speci ® c domain ( activating region ) in SoxS that interacts with a-CTD on zwf-type promoters is not known , nor is the position of a-CTD on the DNA clear .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10102373" target="_blank">10102373</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although Rob shares many similarities with SoxS , it contains a C-terminal domain ( CTD ) that the other paralogs do not .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>The homology to SoxS and MarA is restricted to the N-terminal domain of Rob ( 40 ) , which suggests that a common regulatory activity might reside in this region of the protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>The N-terminal domain of Rob shares similarity with MarA and SoxS , which is in contrast to the other members of the subgroup that share homology within the C-terminal domain ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16478729" target="_blank">16478729</a>]<br></li>
<li>Additionally , and despite similarities in the structures of their DNA-binding domains and cognate DNA-binding sites , the SoxS homologs MarA and Rob did not activate in vivo transcription of yggX under the conditions tested ( Fig. 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA is substantially shorter than other members of this family ( except SoxS ) , whose sizes range from 265 residues ( Rns ) to 321 residues ( XylS ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8383113" target="_blank">8383113</a>]<br></li>
<li>Given that AarP , MarA , PqrA , RamA , SoxS , and TetD , the shortest members of the XylS family ( 106 to 166 amino acids long ) , consist mainly of the homologous segment , the stretch of conserved residues most probably contains all the domains necessary for these regulators to interact with target DNA sequences and RNA polymerase and thus activate transcription from target promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9409145" target="_blank">9409145</a>]<br></li>
<li>These small proteins ( SoxS , 107 residues ; MarA , 127 residues ) are homologous to the C terminus of the XylS-AraC-family of proteins and are more closely related to a ; 100-residue segment in the N terminus of Rob protein , which binds the right arm of the replication origin , oriC .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , in Rob the 100-residue domain homologous to SoxS and MarA is located at the N terminus of the protein ; the C-terminal 175-residue segment of Rob is not related to XylS-AraC-family members ( 40 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>Most family members contain one or more domains in addition to the AraC/XylS-family domain , but a few family members consist only of this single domain , such as MarA and SoxS ( 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17513476" target="_blank">17513476</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MarA protein is shorter than all other known members of this protein family except SoxS and appears to consist primarily of a putative DNA-binding domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8383113" target="_blank">8383113</a>]<br></li>
<li>The SoxS and MarA proteins consist only of the conserved DNA-binding domain ( ∼ 100 residues ) that is present in all AraC/XylS-family members , whereas the Rob protein has an additional C-terminal domain ( ∼ 200 residues ) of unknown function .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10802742" target="_blank">10802742</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxS protein is a member of the XylS/AraC-family , sharing the conserved DNA-binding domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10102373" target="_blank">10102373</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rob , however , is far larger than MarA or SoxS , containing 289 residues , and includes a CTD that is separate from the DNA-binding , N-terminal domain ( Kwon et al. , 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA and its homolog SoxS are unique among AraC proteins in that they have only the DNA-binding domain ( 129 and 107 amino acid residues , respectively ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10873449" target="_blank">10873449</a>]<br></li>
<li>Importantly , both MarA and SoxS are small proteins with 129 and 107 amino acid residues , respectively , and correspond only to the DNA-binding domains of the typical XylS/AraC regulators ( Gallegos et al. , 1997 ; Rhee et al. , 1998 ; Martin and Rosner , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>

<li>SoxS has a potential DNA-binding domain ( helix-turn-helix motif ) and is a member of the XylS/AraC-family of positive transcriptional regulatory proteins ( Wu and Weiss , 1991 ; Amabile-Cuevas and Demple , 1991 ; Gallegos etai , 1993 ) .

<li>Since MarA and SoxS are members of the AraC class of DNA-binding proteins and are highly homologous to each other in the putative helix-turn-helix domains ( 1 , 4 , 8 , 9 ) , it was of interest to determine whether MarA is also a transcriptional activator and whether its mode of action is similar to that of SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>The AraC-family of gene regulators are DNA-binding proteins that contain probable helix-turn-helix DNA-recognition sequences ; such a sequence is also present in SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>

<li>The predicted SoxS protein is homologous to the C-termi-nal regions of the AraC-family of one-component regulators , again including a predicted helix-turn-helix motif ( 1 , 34 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>The SoxS protein is also predicted to bind to one face of the DNA , making contact with two adjacent major grooves ( 41 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11741843" target="_blank">11741843</a>]<br></li>
<li>We found that although Rob makes fewer interactions with σ70 R4 than SoxS , the two proteins make the same , unusual , position-dependent interactions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Accordingly , at the two promoters , Rob makes no more than three protein -- protein interactions with σ70 R4 , whereas SoxS may make as many as 11 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , if the side group of a given wild-type amino acid residue does not make a specific protein -- DNA contact with a functional group of a wild-type base pair , then the effect on transcription-activation of combining a single alanine substitution of that amino acid of Rob and a single base-pair substitution at that position of the robbox would be significantly different from that conferred by the more severe of the two individual mutations ; that is , the effect on activation conferred by one mutation would not be masked by the effect conferred by the other , and thus , the mutations would be non-epistatic to one another .42,48 According to the co-crystal structure of Rob bound to micF DNA ( Fig. 3a ) , residue W36 in helix-3 of Rob 's N-terminal HTH motif makes a van der Waals contact with nucleotide C5 in RE1 ( GCAC ; C5 in boldface ) ,39 the most highly conserved residue in the Rob/SoxS / MarA binding sites.20-22 ,39 Indeed , changing C5 to any of the other three nucleotides severely reduces SoxS-dependent transcription-activation of the fpr and zwf promoters .20 Thus , for our epistasis experiment , we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a C5T substitution into the robbox of a micF-lac transcriptional fusion carried on plasmid pMLB1022 and to prepare a derivative of plasmid pBAD33-Rob carrying substitution W36A of Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this work , we observed that Rob makes only one protein -- protein interaction with σ70 R4 at the fumC ( D75 -- R599 ) and micF ( D75 -- R603 ) promoters , respectively ( Table 1 ) , while SoxS makes three at fumC and four at micF .12 In addition , substitution K593A is the only other substitution of σ70 R4 that reduces Rob-dependent transcription-activation , and it does so only at the fumC but not at the micF promoter ( Table 1 ) ; since no epistatic interaction with it was identified , we presume that the side group of K593 interacts with Rob 's polypeptide backbone or with DNA .52 In contrast , R596A and R599A of σ70 R4 reduce SoxS activation of both promoters , but none of the four potential epistatic interactions were found ; as such , their side groups are presumed to interact with DNA or with the polypeptide backbone of Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>We note that Lonetto et al. determined that , even in the absence of full induction of the lac promoter by treatment with IPTG , the plasmid-encoded σ70 proteins are produced to a level about equal to that of the chromosomally encoded wild-type protein .13 As such , when an alanine substitution of f a tri-alanine scanning library of σ70 R4 at positions 531 -- 590 on Rob-dependent tion activation With a tri-alanine scanning library of amino acid residues of σ70 from positions 531 -- 590 ( residues 531 -- 540 lie in the distal portion of σ70 R3 .2 , residues 541 -- 570 lie in σ70 R4 .1 , and residues 571 -- 590 lie in the N-terminal portion of σ70 R4 .2 ) , 1,46,47 we recently determined that none of the amino acid residues within this region are required for SoxS-dependent activation of transcription from class II promoters fumC and micF , including some substitutions that replace amino acids that are known to interact with nucleotides of the − 35 hexamer .14,42 However , several of the tri-alanine substitutions reduced the basal level of transcription from these class II promoters .42 We inferred from these data that the binding of SoxS to the soxboxes of the class II promoters masks the effects of the tri-alanine substitutions that reduce basal transcription by occluding the binding there of σ70 R3 .2 -- R4 .2.42 Accordingly , we used this library to determine whether Rob and σ70 R3 .2 -- R4 .2 can accommodate one another during transcription-activation of class II promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Using the same tri-alanine scanning library of amino acid residues 530 -- 590 of σ70 R4 as was used in the experiments with SoxS ,42 we found that none of the substitutions reduce Rob-dependent transcription-activation of the fumC , inaA , and micF promoters ( Fig. 2a -- c ) , as was also the case with SoxS .42 Thus , presuming that occlusion requires a specific conformation of the DNA-bound activator , Rob 's CTD does not affect Rob 's ability to carry out this unusual function .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Identification of PC mutations of Rob that reduce transcription-activation of class II promoters Recently , we showed that SoxS and σ70 R4 interact with one another in the yeast two-hybrid system and that the interaction is disrupted by mutations of the class I/II surface but is not disrupted by mutations of the class II surface .12 Thus , we concluded that the protein -- protein interaction in yeast between SoxS and σ70 R4 can occur in solution , that is , `` off DNA '' , and requires amino acids of the class I/II surface but not amino acids of the class II surface .12 In turn , this indicates that the interactions in E. coli between amino acid residues of the class II surface of SoxS and amino acid residues of σ70 R4 occur `` on DNA '' .12 Given the data presented above indicating that Rob 's CTD does not interfere with the binding of Rob 's Nterminal domain ( NTD ) to the robbox of a class II promoter or its activation of several of them ( Figs. 2 and 3 ) , together with the high degree of amino acid sequence identity between the C-terminal HTH motifs of SoxS and Rob ( 9 of 16 amino acids match ) ,16 we hypothesize here that , at class II promoters , SoxS and Rob interact with RNAP using similar functional domains .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , whereas SoxS requires the same four amino acid residues of σ70 ( K593 , R596 , R599 , and R603 ) in its activation of the two class II promoters , Rob requires two of them at the fumC promoter ( K593 and R599 ) , a third ( R603 ) at the micF promoter , and the fourth ( R596 ) at neither .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Another unusual property of SoxS is that the same amino acid residue of its class II surface ( D75 ) contacts two different amino acids of σ70 R4 during transcription-activation of fumC ( R599 ) and micF ( R603 ) .12 Remarkably , the genetic epistasis experiments presented in Figs. 5d and 6b show that D75 of Rob , like D75 of SoxS , contacts R599 of σ70 R4 at the fumC promoter and R603 at the micF promoter .

<li>Given that AarP , MarA , PqrA , RamA , SoxS , and TetD , the shortest members of the XylS family ( 106 to 166 amino acids long ) , consist mainly of the homologous segment , the stretch of conserved residues most probably contains all the domains necessary for these regulators to interact with target DNA sequences and RNA polymerase and thus activate transcription from target promoters .

<li>The nature of the interactions between the transcription activator and RNAP depends on the position and orientation of the DNA-bound activator with respect to the location of the − 35 promoter hexamer .8 Thus , at class I promoters , the activator binding site lies upstream of the − 35 element , and the predominant interaction of the activator is with the `` 287 '' determinant of the C-terminal domain ( CTD ) of the α subunit of RNAP .9 On the other hand , at class II promoters , the activator binding site partially or completely overlaps the − 35 element such that the DNA-bound activator is able to interact directly with region 4 of the σ70 subunit ( σ70 R4 ) .10 -15 Rob , SoxS , MarA , and TetD form a highly paralogous subset of proteins16 within the AraC / XylS family of transcriptional activators , whose hallmark is the presence of two helix -- turn -- helix ( HTH ) DNA binding motifs per monomer .17 Extensive amino acid sequence identity is shared between Rob ( 55 % ) , MarA ( 42 % ) , and TetD ( 49 % ) over the l07-amino-acid length of SoxS , the shortest member of the subset .16 Accordingly , the paralogs share many characteristics .

<li>The soxRS response occurs in two stages : an intracellular signal of oxidative stress converts existing SoxR protein into a potent transcriptional activator of the soxS gene ; the resulting increase in SoxS levels then triggers expression of the various regulon genes ( Amábile - Cuevas and Demple , 1991 ) .

<li>These and other considerations led to the hypothesis that a two-stage system controls the soxRS regulon ( 7 ) : a cellular redox signal ( not necessarily superoxide itself ) activates preexisting SoxR protein , which then triggers expression of the soxS gene , and the elevated level of SoxS protein induces the various genes of the regulon .

<li>The lines underneath show the direct repeats MalE-SoxS fusion proteins activate transcription from the promoter of target genes and can speciﬁcally bind and form multiple DNA-protein complexes thanks to the presence of multiple binding sites at cognate promoters ( 71 , 72 , 151 , 152 ) .

<li>On the other hand , the purified fusion protein binds pooriy to zw / ` sequences ( - 5 7 to +118 ) from plasmid pZ6 -LCB- Fig. 20 ) , which suggests that the sequences between - 6 2 and - 5 7 are important for binding by MaiE-SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>This binding is specific for the zivf promoter region and not the flanking vector sequences , since only a very minor complex forms wilh the control DNA sequences derived from the vector PMLB1034 -LCB- Fig. 2A ) , Figure 2B shows that MalE-SoxS also forms a stable complex with the DNA fragment amplified from plasmid pZ5 , which carries the - 6 2 to +118 segment of zvt/f .

<li>Whereas MalE-SoxS bound poorly to tfie control DNA sequences from p ^ 034gnd -LCB- Fig. 2E ) , it bound well to the DNA fragment amplified with the same primers from pZG5 -LCB- Fig , 2F ) , a derivative ol p ^ 034gnd which carries the 21 bp zwf element immediately upstream of the gnd promoter 's -- 35 hexamer - Moreover , the level of MalESoxS binding to the sequences from pZG5 -LCB- Fig. 2F ) was similar to that of the zwf sequences from pZ5 -LCB- Fig. 2B ) .

<li>From the assay shown in Fig. 2 , as well as others employing a range of concentrations of the fusion protein -LCB- unpublished data ) , we estimate that the dissociation constant for MalE-SoxS binding to DNA sequences containing this 21 bp element is 10 '' * ^ to 10 '' ^ M .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>We also estimate that the dissociation constant for the minor complex formed by MalE-SoxS with zwf promoter-containing DNA sequences from plasmids pZ6 and pZ9 is about 10 '' M , while the dissociation constant for non-specific binding of the fusion profein to the control DNA sequences of plasmids p1034gnd and pMLB1034 appears to be about 10 ^ M. Below we provide an explanation for the minor complexes formed on DNA fragments from pZ6 and pZ9 , which contain the zw/promoter but lack the complete 21 bp upstream element .

<li>This sequence element lies wholly within the region protected by MalE-SoxS from DNase I attack ( 9 , 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>A sequence overlapping the 235 region of micF is protected from DNase I digestion by SoxS protein ( 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here , we showed that fVlalE-SoxS protects from DNase I attack , albeit weakiy , a 22 bp sequence which is 13 bases upstream of the - 3 5 hexamer of the soxS promoter ( Fig , 4 ) , This protection site is enigmatic in that it does not contain the GCAY motif conserved in the other MalE-SoxS-binding sites and the best alignment of a 30 bp sequence containing the protected region matches the soxhox consensus sequence oniy about as well as the zwf 2 secondary binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since this area was not protected from DNase I attack when MalE-SoxS was bound to sequences from pZ5 , the binding affinily of the fusion protein for this site is low when the primaiy site is present .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown previously for MalE-SoxS ( 18 ) , the speciﬁcity of Rob 's requirements for the RNA polymerase a subunit in activating transcription correlates with the location of the activator binding site with respect to the promoter 's 235 hexamer : the zwf sequences protected by Rob from DNase I attack lie upstream of the promoter 's 235 hexamer , while the protected fumC sequences overlap the 235 hexamer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown here and elsewhere , a 21-bp sequence upstream of the zwf promoter is sufﬁcient for DNA binding and transcriptional activation by Rob ( Fig. 3 ) and SoxS ( 9 , 18 ) , and this sequence lies entirely within the region protected by bound protein from attack by DNase I ( Fig. 1 ) .

<li>As seen in Fig. 5 , His6-SoxS protects the sequence extending from nt 65 to 46 which corresponds to the upstream soxbox sequence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11741843" target="_blank">11741843</a>]<br></li>

<li>Therefore , the GCAPy motif may be a primary recognition element for SoxS , with the remaining positions of the Sox-box sequence contrib-uting to the overall afﬁnity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9409145" target="_blank">9409145</a>]<br></li>

<li>The gel mobility shift assays detected a minor complex between MaiE-SoxS and the DNA sequences from deletion plasmids pZ6 and pZ9 ( Fig. 2C and Fig. 2D ) , The probable basis for the formation of this minor complex may be inferred from the fact that a third site , residing at positions - 1 2 to +5 and , therefore , downstream of the primary site , is weakly protected from DNase I attack when MaiE-SoxS is incubated with fhe DNA sequences amplified from pZ6 -LCB- data not shown ) .

<li>Regulation of the nfsA gene in Escherichia coli by SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>These ﬁndings agree with the qRT-PCR ﬁndings ( Table 2 ) that the control of znu by SoxS is unidirectional , only affecting znuCB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>This work implicates SoxS control of znuCB expression as a key factor in persistence of E. coli in murine pyelonephritis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , we favor the explanation that the regulation of znuCB expression by SoxS is indirect and unique , suggesting several possibilities about the regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>These ﬁndings strongly suggest that SoxS induces expression of the znuCB operon in an indirect manner .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>These ﬁndings show that znuCB expression is enhanced by SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>We used PCR to gene-rate a series of 5 ' and 3 ' deletions of the zivf promoter region fused to iacZaud determined which constructs retained or lost the ability of [ S-galactosidase synthesis to be induced by para-quat in a soxR '' soxS ' strain ; we also brought g/nc/expression under control of SoxS by placing the 21 bp minimal soxbox of zwf immediately upstream of the gnd promoter 's - 35 hexa-mer ( W. P , Fawcett and R , E , Wolf , unpublished ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>Using a DNA-dependent protein synthesis system , we showed that the purified MalE-SoxS fusion protein has the promoter specificity required of SoxS : it stimulated zwf but not gnd expression in vitro , a result that has been recently confirmed in a minimal transcription system ( K. W , Jair and R. E. Wolf , unpublished ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , when placed upstream of the normally SoxS-unresponsive gnd promoter , this soxbox brought gnd expression under MalE-SoxS control both in vivo and in vitro ( 7 , 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>Miller et al. ( 32 ) found increased levels of mar mRNA in a constitutively active soxR mutant and suggested that mar expression may be stimulated by SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that the transcription of yggX and mltC , but not that of mutY or nupG , is activated by oxidative stress and that ectopic expression of the SoxS protein is sufﬁcient to evoke this activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , the oxidative stress induction of ptsG can be mimicked by ectopic expression of SoxS in the absence of stress , which suggests that SoxS is necessary , and possibly suYcient , for the activation of ptsG under oxidative stress .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18368388" target="_blank">18368388</a>]<br></li>
<li>Northern analysis showed that mltC , which codes for a peptidoglycan hydrolase and is positioned immediately downstream of yggX , was also regulated by oxidative stress or ectopic expression of SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our data demonstrate that SoxS , a controller of oxidative stress response and antibiotic resistance , also activates znuCB expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , unlike gnd , zwf expression is transcriptionally activated by SoxS during episodes of oxidative stress induced by exposure of E. coli to superoxide-generating agents such as paraquat ( 17 , 18 , 39 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896696" target="_blank">7896696</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , paraquat , which induces SoxS expression ( 14 ) , induced mar transcription twofold only when the marbox and soxRS were present ( Table 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nucleotide position of the 5 end of the transcripts detected is marked by vertical arrows The P1 promoter of ptsG is regulated by SoxS Our mobility shift assays suggest that SoxS induces ptsG expression by activation of the P1 promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18368388" target="_blank">18368388</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxS is also a repressor of the soxS gene ( 34 ) and thus limits its own synthesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>The 6His-SoxS puriﬁed protein , kindly provided by Paratek Pharmaceuticals , Boston , MA , or puriﬁed as described previously ( 36 ) , was produced by cloning the soxS gene into the pET-15b expression plasmid and subsequently purifying the His-tagged protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>It therefore seemed possible that the SoxS protein might act negatively its on own expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8226698" target="_blank">8226698</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , SoxS binds to the soxS promoter in vitro and negatively autoregulates expression of soxS ( 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the physiological relevance of the increase in soxS expression in strains lacking IscR is questionable as no corresponding increase in SoxS target gene expression was observed in the strain lacking IscR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16677314" target="_blank">16677314</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , SoxS might inhibit the expression of its own gene by binding the soxS promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8226698" target="_blank">8226698</a>]<br></li>
<li>( 1993 ) have shown that the autorepression by the SoxS global activator can limit the expression of soxS gene .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>The soxS gene product , SoxS protein , belongs to the AraC/XylS family of DNA-binding transcription factors ( 3 ) , but its activity seems to be regulated solely at the level of expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>The slight increase of MarB observed in the acrR + strain ( Fig. 6b ) might suppress marA transcription , resulting in increased expression of soxS only ( between MarA and SoxS ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25176444" target="_blank">25176444</a>]<br></li>
<li>The GC4468 DsoxRS derivative DJ901 ( 20 ) transformed with pJP105 ( placZ : : soxS lacI Apr ) ( 35 ) was used in the SoxS expression experiment .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>The DJ901-derived strains were transformed with the SoxR expression vector pSXR , the SoxS expression vector pSXS and the control vector pSE380 ( Amábile - Cuevas and Demple , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>For the independent expression of SoxR and SoxS , plasmids pSXR and pSXS were transformed into strain DJ901 ( AsoxR ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>
<li>Conventional analysis using limited proteomics and genetic approaches showed that SoxS activates the expression of 17 genes or operons .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that zwf expression was already maximally activated by the basal level of MaiE-SoxS in DJ901 ( pma/EsoxS ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>In light of this , it is understandable that the basal constitutive level of SoxS expression in the mutants re ¯ ects this partially oxidized ( activated ) state of SoxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>In fact , one SoxS target , sodA , encoding the Mn-containing superoxide dismutase , showed a decrease in expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16677314" target="_blank">16677314</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , its expression was regulated by SoxS ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10714981" target="_blank">10714981</a>]<br></li>
<li>The steady-state level of this transcript containing mltC was increased by exposure to PQ or expression of SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>The stationary-phase-induced , rpoS-dependent expression of pqi-5 was not affected by SoxS mutation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8899708" target="_blank">8899708</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MarA protein controls expression of some of the same genes as SoxS , including many that confer resistance to antibiotics4 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10802742" target="_blank">10802742</a>]<br></li>
<li>The genes that were activated both by PQ and by expression of SoxS are indicated in Table 1 in boldface .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ybjC gene was also activated by expression of SoxS in our experiments ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR and SoxS , which modulate the response to superoxide-gener-ating compounds , activate the expression of a transcript encoding both ﬂavodoxin and Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10419964" target="_blank">10419964</a>]<br></li>
<li>When SoxR is activated by oxidation of its [ 2Fe ± 2S ] cluster , it increases the synthesis of SoxS , which then activates its target gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12773378" target="_blank">12773378</a>]<br></li>
<li>The SoxR and SoxS proteins constitute a sensor-regulator system that senses superoxide and modulates gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18368388" target="_blank">18368388</a>]<br></li>
<li>At present , however , we can not exclude the possibility that one of these factors is acting indirectly through another factor , as SoxS has been reportedto increase the expression of marRAB ( Miller eta / .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Post-transcriptional regulation provides a rapid means of down-regu-lation of gene expression .3 In this context , the micF promoter and not the ompF promoter appears to have primarily evolved to respond to stress-related transcription factors such as SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11601842" target="_blank">11601842</a>]<br></li>
<li>We examined the transcription factors known to respond to nitric oxide ( SoxS and OxyR ) or to influence hmp transcription in E. coli ( Fnr ) for their contribution to aerobic hmp expression in S. typhimurium ( 2 , 15 , 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852058" target="_blank">9852058</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , in Salmonella typhimurium , expression of hmp also is induced after NO treatment ( 18 ) , and its control is independent of the SoxS and OxyR transcription factors but relies on the irondependent Fur repressor ( 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>hmp gene expression in the presence of NOz is independent of the SoxS , OxyR , and FNR transcription factors and instead relies on inactivation of the iron-de-pendent Fur repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852058" target="_blank">9852058</a>]<br></li>
<li>the results do not establish whether MaiE-SoxS , and by extension SoxS , act directly on the member genes of the soxRS reguion .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , the primaiy protected sequences for the genes that are transcriplionally activated by SoxS , namely zwf , sodA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the ydbK and ompN genes are coexpressed in an operon and are likely activated by SoxS indirectly .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>DISCUSSION The DNA sequence ( Fig. 1 ) confirms earlier work on the proteins specified by intact and mutant sox plasmids ( 46 ) that indicated that the sox region contains divergently transcribed genes encoding a 17-kDa SoxR protein and a 13-kDa protein that is now designated as SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1708380" target="_blank">1708380</a>]<br></li>
<li>sodA , nfo , micF , fumC , and soxS ( Figs 3 and 4 ) , genes whose transcription is known to be reguiated by SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>Oxidized SoxR then induces the expression of the second transcription factor SoxS , which directly activates the transcription of sodA ( manganese superoxide dismutase ) , fpr ( ferredoxin / ﬂavodoxinNADP1 reductase ) , zwf ( glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ) , fumC ( fumarase C ) , nfo ( endonuclease IV ) , acnA ( aconitase A ) , and micF ( a regulatory RNA ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10419964" target="_blank">10419964</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxS is evidently the proximal activator of the regulon genes : antibiotic resistance and high-level expression of at least three of the regulon proteins was effected in vivo by the individual expression of SoxS , but not of SoxR , whether or not the cells were exposed to paraquat .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxR ( pl = 9.4 ) and SoxS ( pl = 10.7 ) are both basic proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1708380" target="_blank">1708380</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is possible that the production of the SoxR and SoxS proteins is coordinated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1653416" target="_blank">1653416</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , in the ribA gene , SoxS binds in reverse orientation to the direction of transcription , thus distinguishing it from the rest of the genes of the soxRS regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10102373" target="_blank">10102373</a>]<br></li>
<li>When oxidized , SoxR activates the transcription of soxS , and the resulting SoxS protein activates genes that collectively help to avoid or repair the damage caused by oxidants ( 13 , 18 , 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>When these centers are oxidized , SoxR becomes a transcriptional activator of soxS , and the newly synthesized SoxS protein ( itself a transcriptional activator ) then induces other genes of the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10714981" target="_blank">10714981</a>]<br></li>
<li>Induction occurs in a two-step cascade : ( i ) SoxR protein that is activated by oxidative stress induces the transcription of soxS and ( ii ) SoxS protein then activates the transcription of other genes ( 5 , 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8816757" target="_blank">8816757</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previous work from other laboratories has Indicated that SoxR is the sensor of oxi-dative stress and induces synthesis of SoxS , which in turn activates transcription of the regulon 's target genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7891555" target="_blank">7891555</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon activation , SoxR induces expression of the soxS gene in response to superoxide-generating agents , and then SoxS activates transcription of genes within the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16760308" target="_blank">16760308</a>]<br></li>
<li>Oxidized SoxR then induces the expression of a second transcription factor , SoxS , which in turn activates the transcription of a set of genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11073934" target="_blank">11073934</a>]<br></li>
<li>These and other considerations led to the hypothesis that a two-stage system controls the soxRS regulon ( 7 ) : a cellular redox signal ( not necessarily superoxide itself ) activates preexisting SoxR protein , which then triggers expression of the soxS gene , and the elevated level of SoxS protein induces the various genes of the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>A two-stage control system was hypothesized for soxRS , in which an intracellular redox signal would trigger the SoxR protein as a transcriptional activator of the soxS gene and the resulting increased levels of SoxS protein would activate transcription of the various soxRS regulon genes ( B. Demple and C. F. Amaibile Cuevas , Cell 67:837 -839 , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results support the hypothesis of two-stage regulation ( 7 ) , in which the redox-activated SoxR protein binds the soxS promoter to activate transcription and the elevated levels of SoxS protein induce the various soxRS regulon genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regulation of the acnA and fum gene expression by SoxRS The soxRS oxidative stress regulon responds to superoxide-generating agents such as methyl viologen , by a two-stage process in which the SoxR protein is thought to serve as a redox-sensing activator of the adjacent so.xS gene , followed in turn by the activation of regulon genes bv the SoxS protein ( Amabile-Cuevas & Demple , 1991 ; Hildago & Demple , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>Individual expression of the SoxS protein in the absence of SoxR switched on the micF , sod4 , zwf , and nfo genes ( and presumably the entire soxRS regulon ) , whether or not the cells were exposed to PQ ( 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1400156" target="_blank">1400156</a>]<br></li>
<li>The activity of the SoxS protein is regulated exclusively by its intracellular concentration , and thus the artiﬁcial induction of soxS expression from pJP105 should be sufﬁcient to modulate all genes of the soxRS regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>The elevated expression of the SoxS protein alone is sufficient to activate its target genes of the soxRS regulon in the absence of a redox stress signal ( 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8282690" target="_blank">8282690</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , despite the increased abundance of the soxS transcript , presumably reflecting an increased production of superoxide under aerobic conditions that is sensed by SoxR ( 43 ) , the level of SoxS remains below the threshold required to trigger expression of the SoxS regulon .

<li>( ii ) The presence of the marbox renders the operon subject to control by homologous transcriptional activators such as SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Coregulation of ydbK and ompN fragment by SoxS The possibility that ompN was under the regulation of an upstream gene was then tested .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>While it was encouraging to observe similarities across studies , we also noted several genes or operons expressed oppositely in mice than in previous in vitro ﬁndings for soxS , namely , cysB , cysM , pdhR , and nikB for SoxS ( 12 , 41 ) and yadH for MarA ( 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like SoxS , constitutive expression of the marRAB operon gives enhanced expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase , enzymes that are induced in response to superoxide radical-gen-erating conditions , and also enhanced antibiotic resistance ( 2 , 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7836283" target="_blank">7836283</a>]<br></li>
<li>waaY expression was also regulated by MarA ( multiple-antibiotic resistance regulator ) , which shares a binding site ( soxbox ) with SoxS , and was induced by salicylate , a nonoxidative compound .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19376854" target="_blank">19376854</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA transcription is controlled by the repressor function of MarR ( encoded within the marRAB operon ; Cohen et al. , 1993 ) , whereas SoxS transcription depends on its activation by SoxR ( encoded within the soxRS region ; Amabile-Cuevas & Demple , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>The soxRS operon is induced by oxidative stress which , via SoxS , leads to direct activation of antibiotic resistance factors , including the marRAB operon ( 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8866468" target="_blank">8866468</a>]<br></li>
<li>As the YdbK function has been related to superoxide resistance and this two-gene operon is activated by SoxS and not by MarA , the mutants were tested for resistance to oxidative stress .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22515487" target="_blank">22515487</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , despite being present in ; 5,000 molecules per cell ( 31 ) , Rob is unable to activate zwf transcription in vivo , even though it can bind to zwf DNA in vitro and activate transcription from the same sequences used by SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxS and Rob can also up-regulate acrAB ( 22 ) but are not involved here , since , as already shown , in the absence of the mar operon , mppA : : Cm has no effect on antibiotic sensitivity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10438753" target="_blank">10438753</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , both MarA and MalE-SoxS , respectively , have been shown recently to bend zwf DNA by 508 and 458 and fumC DNA by 348 and 488 ( 38 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>Gel B ( showing only the bound material ) employed a different preparation of MarA from which the His6 tag had not been removed ( the same as in Fig. 2 ) and the comparable preparation of SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097628" target="_blank">21097628</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although MarA , SoxS and Rob could increase acrAB transcription when they were overexpressed , these gene products did not appear to be responsible for the acrAB induction by the general stress conditions such as 4 % ethanol , 0.5 M NaCl or the onset of stationary-phase growth in LB medium ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Evidence also suggests that the up-regulationof acrAB expression under general stress conditions is not likely to be mediated by the known global regulators , such as MarA or SoxS , although elevated levels of these proteins were shown to increase the transcription of acrAB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Third , unlike the general stress conditions , the constitutive overexpression of MarA or SoxS did not increase the transcription of acrR at all ( D. Ma , unpublished results ) , although it increased the transcription of acrAB , as shown in Table 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since it is known that acrAB expression is also induced by the ` global ' regulators MarA ( Ma et al. , 1995 ) and SoxS ( see below ) , we examined the possibility that MarA or SoxS might be mediatingthe responseto general stress conditions , by usingstrainsthat are totally lackingor constitutively producing these regulatoryproteins ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>It would be inte-resting to determine under what conditions these acrAB homologues are induced and how they respond to the global stress-induced regulators , including MarA , SoxS and ( possibly ) Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>The acrAB gene is induced by various environmental stresses , such as eth-anol , osmotic shock and oxidizing agents via MarA and SoxS ( Ma et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15686558" target="_blank">15686558</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although MarA homologue SoxS was also shown to regulate the transcription of acrAB strongly ( Ma et al. , 1996 ; White et al. , 1997 ) , SoxS , also a small protein of 107 residues , exerts its action by altering the level of its own expression , which is regulated via SoxR by oxidizing agents that generate the superoxide radical ( Greenberg et al. , 1990 ; Ding et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although Rob , SoxS and MarA activate micF transcription in response to different environmental stimuli , there is some overlap in response .14 soxS is part of the soxRS regulon .66 SoxR is a sensor protein activated by oxidative stress and in turn it transcriptionally activates soxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11601842" target="_blank">11601842</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the Rob protein 's natural activity in E. coli is not fully understood , Rob can activate many of the same genes as SoxS and MarA3 -- 6 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10802742" target="_blank">10802742</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similar results were obtained when SoxS was induced by para-quat or MarA was provided from a plasmid ( data not presented ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>, 1994 ) , and inaA , encoding a weak acid-inducible protein ( Rosner and Slonczewski , 1994 ) have been shown to be activated by both MarA and SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Presumably , uninduced levels of MarA and/or SoxS mediate a low-level induction of the inaA gene ; the lower basal level of inaA expression in Dmar strains was noted earlier ( Rosner and Slonczewski , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also , the MarA homolog SoxS repressed its own expression in whole cells and bound its own promoter in vitro ( 31 ) ; no further studies of this observation have been reported .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14701822" target="_blank">14701822</a>]<br></li>
<li>Increased expression of nfnB mRNA by plasmid-encoded SoxS and Rob Puriﬁed SoxS and Rob were able to activate nfnB transcription in vitro and bind the nfnB marbox with relatively high afﬁnity even though constitutive chromosomal levels of these proteins did not show a detectable effect on nfnB transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although puriﬁed SoxS and Rob proteins , like MarA , activated nfnB transcription in vitro , only constitutive expression of chromosomal marA , but not of soxS and rob genes , affected nfnB expression in whole cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Still , constitutive expression of chromosomally speciﬁed SoxS and Rob did not activate nfnB expression in whole cells ( Figs 2 and 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previously , overexpression of Rob was shown to induce multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance phenotypes ( 3 ) , to activate expression of fumC , inaA , and sodA in vivo ( 3 ) , and to activate the transcription of six mar/soxRS regulon promoters in vitro by mechanisms that are strikingly similar to that of MarA and SoxS ( 22 ) .

<li>Sufﬁciency of Rob for in vitro transcriptional activation of zwf , fpr , fumC , micF , nfo , and sodA , promoters known to be activated by MalE-SoxS and MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>To determine whether the puriﬁed MarA protein affected gene expression , we tested its ability to activate the in vitro transcription of zwf , sodA , micF , and fumC , genes known to be under mar control in vivo , and of fpr and nfo , genes not known to be regulated by mar in vivo but activated by SoxS in vivo and by MalE-SoxS in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since these transcription activation properties of Rob are virtually identical to those of MalE-SoxS and MarA , it appears as if the E. coli genome encodes three genes with the same functional capacity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>The report ( 32 ) that overexpression of SoxS induced mar transcription in vivo led us to test for transcriptional activation of mar by puriﬁed MarA and MalE-SoxS proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>The genes encoding these proteins are activated by the homologous proteins MarA and SoxS , although the level of activation can vary for the different transcription factors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10802742" target="_blank">10802742</a>]<br></li>
<li>Additionally , and despite similarities in the structures of their DNA binding domains and cognate DNA binding sites , the SoxS homologs MarA and Rob did not activate in vivo transcription of yggX under the conditions tested ( Fig. 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , transcription of the marRAB operon is autorepressed by MarR and autoactivated by MarA at a site that also can be activated by SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , SoxS and MarA can utilize the same 21-bp sequence to activate zwf transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8522515" target="_blank">8522515</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , in contrast to SoxS and MarA , whose syntheses are induced by speciﬁc environmental stimuli and elicit a clear defense response , Rob is expressed constitutively and its normal function is unknown .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>( 1991 ) Same as GC4468 ; marR ( cfxB1 ) JHC1069 Discussion Transcription of acrAB is up-regulated in mutants constitutively producing MarA or SoxS and in a strain that overexpresses Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the observation that SoxS binds to , and seems to negatively regulate , its own promoter ( 33 ) raises the possibility that MarA and Rob could also negatively regulate soxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Down-regulation of rob mediated by MarA ( and also SoxS and Rob ) adds to the regulatory cross-talk already reported ( 15 -- 17 ) and shows that the rob promoter and protein are controlled at both pre - and posttranscriptional levels in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16478729" target="_blank">16478729</a>]<br></li>
<li>The b-galactosidase activities show that only when its marbox is in the F-orientation is the zwf promoter activated by MarA or SoxS ( Table 3 , top rows ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10564485" target="_blank">10564485</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similarly , the micF promoter is activated by MarA or SoxS only when the micF marbox is in the F-orientation ( Table 3 , rows 10 and 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10564485" target="_blank">10564485</a>]<br></li>
<li>From an analysis of the promoters that are activated by these proteins , it is clear that the orientation of the marbox and its distance from the -10 hexamer of the promoter are critical in determining whether MarA , SoxS and Rob can activate the promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activation by the monomeric proteins MarA , SoxS and Rob requires that they bind to a marbox located in a particular orientation upstream of the TSS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Protein-DNA interactions show that SoxS and Rob , like MarA , bind the same marbox in the rob promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16478729" target="_blank">16478729</a>]<br></li>
<li>For instance , Rob has been shown to bind and activate the zwf promoter in vitro but whole cell zwf regulation can not be activated by Rob , although the gene responds to SoxS and MarA ( Ariza et al. , 1995 ; Jair et al. , 1995 1996a ; b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is likely that the three gene products ( MarA , Rob , and SoxS ) improve the level of organic solvent tolerance via a TolC function .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9473050" target="_blank">9473050</a>]<br></li>
<li>Results and discussion tolC TSSs Transcription of tolC is activated by MarA , SoxS and Rob ( Aono et al. , 1998 ) but the relevant tolC promoter has not yet been deﬁned .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two previously identiﬁed tolC promoters , p1 and p2 , are not regulated by MarA , SoxS or Rob but p2 is activated by EvgAS and PhoPQ which also regulate other functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>On re-investigation , we found two new TSSs for tolC ( corresponding to promoters p3 and p4 ) that lie downstream of the marbox and are activated by MarA , SoxS and Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conclude that the tolC promoter ( s ) activated by MarA , SoxS and Rob must lie downstream of p1 and p2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the observation that in vivo zwf transcription can be activated by MarA and SoxS , but not by Rob ( 5 ) , shows that control by these regulators may not overlap completely .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , transcription of marA is activated by MarA and by the MarA homologs SoxS and Rob , mostly in the presence of the helper protein Fis ( 32 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20211899" target="_blank">20211899</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , when induced by paraquat , the activity of SoxS was not dependent on either MarA or Rob ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>

<li>However , the expression of these regulators was not affected by AcrS and AcrR ( data not shown ) , indicating that the acrAB repression by AcrR and AcrS is unlikely to be mediated by MarA , SoxS , or Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18567659" target="_blank">18567659</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , three independently regulated but homologous proteins , MarA , SoxS and Rob , activate a common set of promoters which results in multiple antibiotic resistance , superoxide resistance and organic solvent tolerance ( for review , see Alekshun and Levy , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10564485" target="_blank">10564485</a>]<br></li>
<li>tolC is regulated in part by MarA , SoxS and Rob , three paralogous transcriptional activators which bind a sequence called the marbox and which activate multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>The three paralogous Escherichia coli AraC/XylS family activators MarA , SoxS , and Rob are regulated by three different systems ( marRAB , soxRS , and rob , respectively ) in response to different stresses ( 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097628" target="_blank">21097628</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , in Rob the 100-residue domain homologous to SoxS and MarA is located at the N terminus of the protein ; the C-terminal 175-residue segment of Rob is not related to XylS-AraC family members ( 40 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .

<li>Our ﬁnding that ZnuACB is controlled by SoxS further deﬁnes control of this important pathogenic factor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our results indicatethat pqi-5 is regulated independently by SoxS and os .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8899708" target="_blank">8899708</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggested that ptsG transcription is positively regulated by SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18368388" target="_blank">18368388</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the E. coli ygfZ gene contains a marbox structure and is SoxS regulated ( 12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20489182" target="_blank">20489182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Genes nfo , sodA , yggX and ygfZ are regulated by marbox sequences that are evidently driven by SoxS [ 12,20,21 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21059273" target="_blank">21059273</a>]<br></li>
