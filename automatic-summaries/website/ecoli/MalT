<li>All of the amino acid substitutions altering the DT3 H10/HT11 area speciï¬cally affect MalT repression by MalK To quantify the effect of the DT3 up mutations on the activity of MalT , we measured the amount of b-galactosidase synthesized by two isogenic reporter strains when transformed with pOM181 or variants thereof and grown in minimal medium supplemented with glycerol : the DmalT malK C strain used above ( pop7191 ) , in which MalT was repressed by MalK , and an isogenic DmalT DmalK strain ( pop7190 ) , in which the activity of MalT was unrepressed .

<li>This is the case for TyrR ,23 MalT ,24 BirA ,25 and NtrC .26 For eukaryotic nuclear receptors , including the vitamin D and retinoic acid receptors , regulatory ligands determine not only the oligomeric state of the receptor but als in Â¯ uence the assembly of heterodimers of mixed receptor type , processes that have consequences for target site selection .27,28 In general , these effectorlinked assembly processes provide an indirect means of regulating DNA target-site occupancy , and ultimately transcriptional activity , via small changes in ligand concentration .25 One of the most interesting aspects of the Lrp regulon is the different regulatory patterns that relate to Lrp-leucine interactions .

<li>Treha-lose is not transported by the maltose system , nor does treha-lose or trehalose-6-phosphate stimulate MalT ; also , MalT does not regulate any of the genes involved in the degradation of trehalose , since malT mutants grow well on trehalose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>With respect to the latter , this may be equivalent to the suppression by overproduction of MalT of the effectson maltose regulon expression that are caused by catabolite repression ( Chapon , 1982 ) or the fact that maltose-regulon expression is maltose-independent in E. coli strains carrying multiple copies of malT .

<li>Pro-27 vided that our model is correct , the propensity of MalT to self-associate might cause the extension of the homo-oligomer speciï¬cally assembled upon recognition of the MalT sites at high MalT concentration , and lead to the formation of a curved homopolymer similar to those revealed by our cryo-EM analyses and around which the DNA fragment might wrap .

<li>However , it is worth noting that , were this hypothesis correct , formation of unproductive aggregates might be consequential to the artiï¬cially high concentrations of active MalT needed to achieve saturation of malEpD64 ; hence some of the stimulatory effects observed under these conditions might not exist under normal conditions .

<li>It is therefore tempting to speculate that MalT might activate transcription initiation by a mechanism different from that used by CI or CRP to activate PR or lacZp ( de Crombrugghe et al. , 1984 ; Ptashne , 1986 ) .

<li>The end points of the malEp upstream deletions malEpD64 and malEpD92 ( Raibaud et al. , 1989 ) are indicated Results Each set of three MalT sites ( 3/4/5 and 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' ) forms a functional unit to which MalT binds cooperatively ( Danot & Raibaud , 1994 ; Richet et al. , 1991 ) .

<li>The sensitivity of higher-order structure formation to the phasing between the proximal and distal sets of MalT sites is essentially determined by MalT Previous studies lead us to propose that formation of the higher-order structure at malEpmalKp is sensitive to the phasing between MalT sites 1/2 and the distal set of sites , and only occurs when MalT occupies sites 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' ( Richet et al. , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Elegant studies by Raibaud , Richet and colleagues have shown that CRP serves to reposition MalT to an alternative set of T boxes that results in activation ( Richet et al. , 1991 ; Richet and Sogaard , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>CRP bound to site 1 plays a speciï¬c role in malEp + activation The observation that CRP site 1 still strongly stimulated malEp in the absence of any distal MalT sites ( Raibaud et al. , 1989 ; Vidal-Ingigliardi et al. , 1991 ) suggested that the CRP molecule bound to site 1 might play an active role in malEp activation , besides its structural role in the assembly of the active complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Discussion A unique nucleoprotein assembly activates malEp and malKp The MalT sites 1 and 2 , as well as the CRP sites 1 , 2 and 3 had all been shown to play a role in malEp activation ( Vidal-Ingigliardi & Raibaud , 1991 ; Vidal-Ingigliardi et al. , 1991 ) , but so far it was not clear which of the MalT sites present in the distal region are involved in promoter activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the promoter of the malPQ operon , which is as strong as malEp and malKp , apparently depends only on , MalT for its activity ( Chapon , 1982 ; Raibaud et al. , 1985 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2016744" target="_blank">2016744</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to other maltose operon promoters , which are regulated only by MalT : malEp and malKp are also positively controlled by CRP , a pleiotropic regulator involved in the control of carbon source utilization ( De Crombrugghe et al. , 1984 ; Chapon , 1982 ; Richet & Raibaud , 1987 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>While the requirement for MalT is absolute ( Bedouelle , 1983 ) , the dependence on CRP is less stringent : malEp and malKp still work at 20 % and lo % , respectively , in the presence of MalT alone ( Raibaud et al. , 1989 ; Vidal-Ingigliardi & Raibaud , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2016744" target="_blank">2016744</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , it should be pointed out that MalT binding to the malEp - malKp region , which contains five MalT boxes , appears to be highly cooperative ( Raibaud et al. , 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>One should recall that the nucleoprotein assembly formed at , malEp-malKp is thought to involve wrapping of the DNA around a core formed by the bound molecules of CRP and MalT ( Raibaud et al. , 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2016744" target="_blank">2016744</a>]<br></li>
<li>Genetic data strongly suggest that this sequence is part of the MalT binding site ( Bedouelle , 1983 ; Gutierrez & Raibaud , 1984 ; Raibaud et al. , 1985 ) , but direct evidence that MalT binds to the `` MalT box '' is so far lacking .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two other specific DNA-binding proteins that have been shown to alter their DNA contacts in response to environmental signals are the AraC and MalT proteins of E. coil ( Lobell and Schleif , 1990 ; Richet et al. , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8087856" target="_blank">8087856</a>]<br></li>
<li>As a result , the speciï¬c inactivation of one site within a given unit is generally sufï¬cient to reduce MalT binding to this unit without precluding MalT binding to the overlapping set of MalT sites ( Richet et al. , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , the presence of the biotinylation domain ( BCCP ) attached to the C-terminus of MalT for protein immobilization renders MalT inactive in vivo ( Panagiotidis et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in controlled by MalT ( Raibaud et al. , 1985 ) , depends only on the presence of ApA and CTP as substrates .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown ( Raibaud et al. , 1989 ) , the afinity of MalT for its DNA binding sites is rather weak in the presence of chloride salts , which was a limiting factor for in vitro studies .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2016744" target="_blank">2016744</a>]<br></li>
<li>The minimal features establishing a gene as MalT dependent are the presence of a MalT box at Â¹ 38 , replacing the usual Â¹ 35 region of a standard promoter , plus two MalT boxes in tandem orientation further upstream on the same side of the DNA helix ( Vidal-Ingigliardi et al. , 1991 ; Danot and Raibaud , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of these two ligands , MalT binds to a degenerate decanucleotide sequence , 58-GGGGA ( T/G ) GAGG-38 ( T box ) , that is found in various permutations upstream of all mal promoters ( Richet and Raibaud , 1989 ; Vidal-Ingigliardi et al. , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two observations indicate that MalT binds the mal promoters as an oligomer : ( i ) like MalT oligomerization , promoter binding depends on the presence of both effectors ( Raibaud and Richet , 1987 ; Richet and Raibaud , 1989 ; Schreiber and Richet , 1999 ) ; and ( ii ) MalT binds cooperatively to the MalT sites present in the promoters ( Vidal-Ingigliardi et al. , 1991 ; Danot and Raibaud , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>We tried the highest MalT concentration possible in order to fiil in all the non-mutated sites in the malPpW , malPp20 and malPp30 variants but we were iimited by the fact that above 500 nM and in the absence of RNA polymerase MalT seemed to slowly aggregate on the promoter and reverslbly inactivated it .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the ï¬nding that the 3/4/5 set of sites stimulates malEp to some extent provided that the concentration of active MalT protein is high + enough ( i.e. in an induced malT strain ) indicates that the oligomeric structure built by MalT when occupying sites 1/2 and 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' can also form when MalT occupies sites 1/2 and 3/4/5 , albeit less efï¬ciently .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>malEpD64 was most active in the malTp1 malTp7 malPQ + strain in which protection of th MalT sites 1 and 2 was complete .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , malEpD64 and malEpD92 displayed similar partial occupancy of MalT sites 1 and 2 when present in the malPQ â overproducing strain , while malEpD92 was 14-fold more active than malEpD64 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Occupation of MalT sites 1 and 2 in malEpD64 in strains containing increasing amounts of active MalT protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Occupation of MalT sites 1 and 2 in the malEpD92 and malEpKp1 ,2,3 , I3 variants in strains containing increasing amounts of active MalT protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The role ( s ) that this structure or elements thereof play in the activation of malEp is analysed by monitoring both the occupancy of the proximal MalT sites ( sites 1 and 2 ) and the activity of different malEp variants in strains containing increasing amounts of active MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Role of the regulatory elements involved in malEp activation Promoter activity assays combined with analysis of the occupancy of MalT sites 1 and 2 of different malEp variants in strains producing increasing amounts of active MalT protein proved to be a successful approach to deï¬ne the role of the multiple regulatory elements involved in malEp activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>This simpie model is supported by the observation that the concentration of MalT is limiting for the activation of the promotere of the maltose reguion ( Hatfield et al. .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>Second , they exhibit the same sigmoidal responses to increasing concentration of MalT in vitro ( Richet & Raibaud , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>This inference is further supported by the observation that , in vitro , malEp and malKp exhibit superimposable sigmoidal responses to increasing concentration of MalT ( Richet & Raibaud , 1991 ) , which indicates that the same event of cooperative binding underlies the two activation processes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The in vivo DMS protection pattern of MalT sites 1 and 2 in malEp + is qualitatively similar to that obtained in vitro ( Richet & Raibaud , 1991 ) , although it is weaker than that observed in vitro under saturating conditions , which suggests that the MalT sites 1 and 2 of malEp + are only partially occupied in vivo , even under conditions of full induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , the 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' set of sites is clearly the most efï¬cient of the two sets of MalT sites in stimulating malEp at a saturating concentration of MalT , while only the sites 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' have the capacity to stimulate malEp when the MalT concentration becomes limiting .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Strikingly , MalT at a concentration which was too low to protect the maIPp MalT sites in the absence of RNA poiymerase was sufficient to give nearly full protection in its presence 0 O. Danot and O. Raibaud 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 - ao .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>The relative ability of the two sets of MalT sites to activate malEp was also examined under conditions in which the concentration of active MalT was limiting , i.e. in the presence of glycerol as the sole carbon source ( Vidal-Ingigliardi & Raibaud , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that the concentration of MalT at which half-protection was observed was not changed in the presence of a fivefold excess of unlabelled DNA fragment indicates that active MalT protein was present in excess in t ' hese experiment , s. Therefore , the relatively high concentration required to achieve protection probably reflects the low affinity of the protein for its DNA binding sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>This reduction of MgCl , concentration results in a 2-fold increase of MalT affinity for its DNA binding sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>The above observations argue against a strict DNA loop model ( Hochschild & Ptashne , 1986 ) and are more consistent with a scenario whereby MalT binding to malEp-malKp results in the wrapping of the int , ervening DNA around a core of MalT proteins , this phenomenon occurring whether or not one set of MalT binding sites is missing .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>The observation that the function of these sites is sensitive to the phase of the DNA helix has led to a model in which the DNA is wrapped around the complex composed of MalT and cAMP / CAP ( 199 , 206 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>The simplest interpretation of these observations is that the oligomeric assembly resulting from the cooperative binding of MalT onto sites 1/2 and sites 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' can also form when MalT occupies sites 1/2 and 3/4/5 , albeit less easily , and that both types of complex can activate malEp ( see Discussion ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The sigmoidicity of the curve reflects the cooperative binding of MalT to the three MalT operator sites involved in malPp activation ( 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>The curve representing the response to increasing concentrations of MalT in the absence of MalY is sigmoidal as a result of co-operative binding of the activator to the three MalT sites present in malPp ( Danot and Raibaud , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent studies revealed that the unliganded form of the protein is monomeric and that the function of both of these effectors is to induce MalT selfassociation , thought to play a critical role in promoter binding ( 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the precise mechanism of how MalT interacts with and stimulates RNA polymerase is still unknown , there is considerable information about the structural requirements for MalT binding to DNA as well as its ability to form a nucleoprotein complex with the catabolite activator protein ( CAP ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Truncated forms of MalT lacking its C-terminal DNA binding domain are negatively dominant over the function of the wild-type protein , indicating that the protein interacts with itself when binding to DNA ( 40 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>position function of the Sfsl protein is as a kind of DNA binding protein or interacting protein with an activating protein such as MalT or CRP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2013578" target="_blank">2013578</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , the results presented in Figs 5 and 6 and in Table 1 demonstrate that MalT binding to maIPp is a cooperative process which involves interactions between the MalT molecules bound to the different sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , our results make it unlikely that MalT binding to target promoters implicates a discrete high-order multimer involving both isologous and heterologous interactions between protomers , as proposed by Raibaud , to account for cooperative 25 binding of MalT to diversely orientated MalT sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , one can not exclude the alternative scenario in which one ligand affects the interaction of the MalT monomer with a MalT box whereas the binding of the other ligand promotes interactions between different MalT monomers , thereby stabilizing the nucleoprotein complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thirdly , CAP may reposition UhpA bound to uhpTp rather than stabilize binding of the activator , as is seen with CAP and MalT interaction at the malK promoter ( 32 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896692" target="_blank">7896692</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , an attractive possibility is that MalT in fact exists as an oligomer , e.g. a tetramer , in which nucleotide binding to one protomer prevents binding to the other protomers through anticooperative effects .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>After binding the inducer , MalT activates the transcription of all mal operons .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2670898" target="_blank">2670898</a>]<br></li>

<li>More attractively , this phenomenon may be directly related to a crucial role that supercoiling might play in the formation and stability of a functional pre-initiation complex involving MalT , CRP and malEp-malKp .

<li>Indeed , the presenceof a large number of MalT molecules in the overproducing cells would be expected to result in the substitution by MalT of the CRP molecules bound to the malEp-malKp regulatory region , leading to the formation of the less active nucleoprotein complex containing only MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under these conditions the formation of active complexes at malEp and malKp could be easily followed as a function of time after addition of polymerase to the template that had been preincubated for 20 minutes with MalT and CRP ( Fig. 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2016744" target="_blank">2016744</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , no transcripts were observed for malEp and malKp even when active complex formation was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes or , as tested for malKp , when MalT and CRP concentrations were simultaneously increased four - and 2 + fold , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2016744" target="_blank">2016744</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rather , we could explain these observations by suggesting the formation of a nucleoprotein complex in which the proteins form a scaffold for wrapping the regulatory DNA in a way somewhat similar to the structure adopted by the interspersed bound MalT and CRP proteins responsible for malK promoter activation Table !! .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7748925" target="_blank">7748925</a>]<br></li>
<li>Most of the in vivo properties malKp promoters can be explained by this model if we assumethat the integrity of these nucleoprotein structures , i.e. the anchorage points on both sides and the correct wrapping of the DNA , is essential for transcription activation by this complex and if we assume that the complex involving both MalT and CRP is the most active species.Deletions of the distal MalT boxes destroy the anchorage points .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>It should be noted that we have presented the simplest model accounting for our present results and that this model relies on the assumption that the complex MalT forms in vitro with malEp-malKp is closely related to the structure actually responsible for transcription activation in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , in vitro , MalT repositioning onto sites 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' , i.e. , formation of a higher-order structure based on sites 1/2 and 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' , is correlated with an increase in the afï¬nity of MalT for sites 1 and 2 ( E.R. , unpublished results ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , the possibility that the enhanced occupation of MalT sites 1 and 2 observed in the malEp + context results from a local effect , e.g. , from a direct interaction with CRP bound to the adjacent CRP 1 site , rather than from the formation of the higher-order structure is excluded by the observation that in vivo ( this work ) and in vitro ( unpublished results ) CRP binding to site 1 does not signiï¬cantly increase the afï¬nity of MalT for sites 1 and 2 in malEpD92 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , a variant in which both functional units ( 3/4/5 and 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' ) had been inactivated by the destruction of sites 3 , 4 , 3 ' and 4 ' displays the same level of activity as malEpD92 ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) , thereby excluding the possibility that the malEp stimulation still observed when either set of distal MalT sites is inactivated is due to some other sequence element and not to the remaining set .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>To ensure that the occupation of MalT sites 1 and 2 observed with malEp + was not due to a stabilizing effect of RNA polymerase bound at malEp and/or malKp , I veriï¬ed that MalT sites 1 and 2 were similarly occupied in the absence of functional â 10 sequences .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The mechanism of activation by CRP is clearly different from that occurring at the divergent malEp-malKp promoters , which are simultaneously controlled by an array of three binding sites for CRP , all located at distal positions in between ( 36 ) , and forming a high-order structure responsible for activation , assisting direct activation by the MalT primary regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9573142" target="_blank">9573142</a>]<br></li>
<li>The binding of MalT and CRP to this region is known to result in the formation of a higher-order structure that is responsible for malKp activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>This stabilizing effect most likely results from the assembly of the higher-order structure formed by MalT and CRP at malEp-malKp .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Some elements of this structure , namely the CRP site 1 , located at â 76.5 , and the distal MalT sites , seem to play a direct role in malEp activation besides their participation in the assembly of the higher-order structure .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , this suggests that malEpD64 might actually represent a minimal MalT-dependent promoter that is inactive because of a too low occupation of MalT sites 1 and 2 , and that the role of the upstream elements in malEp activation might simply be to ensure high occupation of MalT sites 1 and 2 through the assembly of a higher-order structure with MalT and CRP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Formation of this structure is disfavored when MalT is present alone and the role of CRP in malKp activation is to facilitate the repositioning of MalT onto sites 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' by stabilizing this higher-order structure .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , malEp activation primarily relies on MalT sites 1/2 , 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' and on the CRP sites 1/2/3 , i.e. on the same set of regulatory elements as malKp activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , occupation of this series of sites is prevented by MalT binding to the overlapping 3/4/5 set of sites for which MalT has a higher intrinsic afï¬nity , and whose occupation does not lead to promoter activation because it is incorrectly located with respect to the promoter â 35 / â 10 elements .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>This study indeed revealed the following : ( 1 ) occupation of MalT sites 1 and 2 is sufï¬cient to promote malEp activation ; ( 2 ) in vivo , under conditions of full induction , the activity of the truncated malEpD64 promoter is severely limited by the degree of occupancy of MalT sites 1 and 2 ; ( 3 ) one role of the upstream regulatory elements is to stabilize MalT at sites 1 and 2 ; ( 4 ) full occupation of these sites is not sufï¬cient , however , to ensure full promoter activity ; ( 5 ) CRP site 1 and the upstream MalT sites can independently increase the capacity of MalT bound to sites 1 and 2 to stimulate malEp ; and ( 6 ) this effect of CRP bound to site 1 does not involve stabilization of MalT at sites 1 and 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , when MalT is limiting , malEp activation critically depends on the 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' set of sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>This indicates that the distal set of MalT sites plays an additional role in malEp activation besides aiding MalT to-bind to sites 1 and 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The role of the upstream sets of MalT sites in malEp activation was assessed by examining in vivo the effect of mutations speciï¬cally inactivating either set of sites on promoter activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that complete occupation of MalT sites 1 and 2 only partially reactivates malEpD64 indeed strongly suggests that some of the upstream elements play a speciï¬c role in malEp activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The location of Fis site I at nt 41 is analo-D 2 gous to the positions of other activators , such as the l repressor , MalT , AraC , and CRP ( in some cases ) , in which direct contact with s70 has been implicated ( 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7545153" target="_blank">7545153</a>]<br></li>
<li>The data presented here clearly establish that occupation of MalT site 1 and 2 is indeed not sufï¬cient to fully activate malEp , and that both the CRP site 1 and the distal MalT sites further stimulate malEp , 14 and ï¬vefold , respectively , when the proximal MalT sites are similarly occupied .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The absence of any cooperativity in the binding of MalT and CRP to sites 1/2 and 1 , respectively , as revealed by the in vivo footprinting experiments makes it unlikely that contact with MalT bound to site 2 mediates this stimulatory effect of CRP , and lends support to the hypothesis of an interaction with the polymerase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , we verified that the activity of each promoter in vitro depended on the presence of the distal MalT binding sites , and that the promoters were also specifically sensitive to insertions in the central region that change the relative orientation of the distal and proximal moieties of the regulatory region .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2016744" target="_blank">2016744</a>]<br></li>
<li>The EcoRI-EcoRI DNA fragments of were transferred in both orientations in front of the mulPQ maZEp and of malKp promoter was then measured by assaying ( d ) DNase I footprint of MalT bound to malEpmalKp ( c ) Effect of deletions and insertions in the absence of CRP To determine whether the involvement of the distal MalT binding sites depended on the presence of CRP and to study their role in the DNA-turn dependence , we examined the effect of deletions and insertions on promoter activity in the absence of CRP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that the insertions have the same qualitative effect on malKp activity whether or not CRP is present suggests that in the presence of CRP the distal MalT binding sites have also to be stereoaligned with some downstream regulatory elements .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this system , malEp and malKp are active only in the presence of both MalT and CRP , and various mutations in the MalT or CRP binding sites affect the promoters in the same way as they do in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2016744" target="_blank">2016744</a>]<br></li>
<li>( ( a ) malEp and malKp function in vitro as in vivo To ensure tha.t our in oitro system really mimics events occ * urring in , z ' iz > o , we examined whether malflp and malKp activity depended on the pre-sence of the distal MalT binding sites and on the presence of the same set of CRP binding sites as in Gvo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2016744" target="_blank">2016744</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , inactivation of both distal sets of MalT sites together with the three CRP sites abolishes promoter activity as efï¬ciently as deletion malEpD64 ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) , thereby indicating that , in the absence of functional CRP sites , malEp activity is fully dependent on the presence of either set of distal MalT sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>To determine whether the higher efï¬ciency of the 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' set of sites in promoting assembly of a higher-order structure depended on the presence of CRP , I measured the effect of the distal sets of MalT sites on malEp in the absence of functional CRP sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The observations that the 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' set of sites has a stronger stimulatory effect on malEp than the 3/4/5 sites regardless of the presence of functional CRP sites and that CRP similarly enhances the stimulatory effect of both sets of MalT sites , indicates that the sensitivity to the phasing is actually essentially determined by MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The distal MalT sites play an additional role in malEp activation The possibility that the MalT molecules bound to either set of distal sites might play a direct role in malEp activation was tested by examining whether , when achieved in the presence of the distal MalT sites , full occupation of the proximal MalT sites would restore promoter activity to a higher level than that observed with malEpD64 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The hypothesis of a direct role for CRP site 1 was tested by examining whether occupation of MalT sites 1 and 2 in the presence of CRP site 1 increased malEp activity to a higher level than that observed with malEpD64 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the fact that in pop2226 , the malEpKp1 ,2,3 , I3 variant is only 29 % as active as the wild-type promoter , while displaying similar occupation of MalT sites 1 and 2 , suggests that complete occupation of MalT sites 1 and 2 in the presence of the distal MalT sites is not sufï¬cient to restore malEp activity fully and that one of the CRP sites also plays a direct role in promoter activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that in the malPQ â overproducing strain , malEpD92 was almost as active as malEp + in pop2226 for a similar occupancy of MalT sites 1 and 2 , indicates that ï¬lling MalT sites 1 and 2 in the presence of CRP site 1 efï¬ciently restores promoter activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Even when the defect in MalT synthesis in the absence of CRP was counteracted the of by presence a mutation in the malTp promoter that renders its activity CRP-independent , some problems persisted that impeded any quantitative assessment of the role played by CRP in the activation of the promoters of the three mal operons , malPQ , malEFG , and malK-lamB-malM ( 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1824723" target="_blank">1824723</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mutations inactivating either MalT site 4 or the CRP site -LCB- malPp40 and malPpSO ) had no effect at all on the uninduced or induced activity of the promoter , clearly demonstrating the absence of any functional role for these two sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>The activity of the Ep92 promoter still depends on MalT ; its dependence on CRP has not been tested .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>malEp and malKp are inactive in the absence of CRP , but their activity can be partially restored by overproducing MalT ( Chapon , 1982 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>In both cases , deletion of the distal MalTbinding sites impaired promoter function to about the same extent as in a crp ' strain ( compare Kp228 to Kp240 , and Epl99 to Ep236 ) , showing that in the absence of CRP MalT boxes located between positions -200 and - 240 upstream from the transcription start site are still involved in transcription activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vitro run-off transcription assays have revealed no significant transcription initiation in either direction from this site , either in the presence or absence of MalT and CRP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>

<li>This model is compatible with the known properties of CRP , since the direction of the bend induced by the binding of CRP to its recognition site ( Liu-Johnson et al. , 1986 ) is the same as the one resulting from DNA wrapping around MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>One of its function is architectural : via binding to the three CRP binding sites and bending the DNA , it facilitates cooperative binding of MalT onto sites 1/2 and the distal sites ( Richet & Sogaard-Andersen , 1994 ) , thereby ensuring high occupancy of the critical MalT sites 1 and 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>CRP binding to these sites bends the DNA and causes MalT to shift 3 bp downstream to-binding sites from which MalT can activate transcription ( 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16166533" target="_blank">16166533</a>]<br></li>
<li>Is the sensitivity to the relative angular orientation of the proximal and distal sets of MalT sites a property intrinsic to MalT or is it due to the increased torsional stiffness of the intervening DNA resulting from CRP binding ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , it is difï¬cult to conclude whether the DNA and the MalT oligomers speciï¬cally interact via MalT recognition sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>

<li>However , a constant consequence of MalT -- DNA interaction is the strong reduction in the radius of curvature of the MalT oligomers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , dimethylsulphate protection experiments provide evidence that the nucleoprotein complexes formed by CRP and MalT bound to malEp and TmalKp on supercoiled and relaxed DNA are different .

<li>This indicates that in the malEpD92 context , CRP does not cause increased transcription by stabilizing MalT at sites 1 and 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>

<li>As mentioned in the Introduction , the MalT protomer bound to the most proximal MalT site is thought to contact RNA polymerase ( Danot et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>One possibility is that the CRP molecule bound to site 1 or/and one of the MalT protomers distally bound facilitate the initiation process , either by directly contacting the polymerase or by aiding one of the MalT protomers bound downstream to interact with the enzyme .

<li>One could also imagine that the CRP molecule bound to site 1 contacts the polymerase even though its binding site is not at a permissive location ( Choy et al. , 1995 ) , and that the MalT protomers bound downstream transform this contact into a productive one .

<li>We can not be sure that the nucleoprotein complex formed by maIPp and MalT involves only three active MalT mole-cules bound to sites 1 - 3 , However , for the purposes of this discussion , we will make this supposition as a working hypothesis .

<li>In contrast , these mutations caused a 5 -- 14 times increase in the activity of malEpD92 in the presence of MalK , which resulted in a dramatic decrease in the repression by MalK from 12.5 for wild-type MalT to 1.0 -- 1.9 for the mutants .

<li>Therefore , the effect of MalY and MalK on the activity of MalT depends on the amount of MalT and on the presence of inducer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also , to ensure that inhibition by MalY , if any , would be detected , the assays were performed in the presence of a limiting concentration of MalT , i.e. a concentration giving about half of the maximum response under the chosen ligand concentration conditions ( see the inset in Fig. 1 ) .

<li>However , because the comparative assays reported here were performed in the presence of a saturating concentration of MalT , a differential effect of CRP might have been overlooked , and the possibility remains that CRP may also increase the bias toward the 1/2 -3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' looped structures via an increase in the torsional rigidity of the DNA in the central region .

<li>the activities of mdEp and malKp depend on the presence of both CRP and MalT as they do in viva .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2016744" target="_blank">2016744</a>]<br></li>
<li>The studies reported here , which consist of DNase I footprinting of MalT bound to DNA fragments containing various segments of malEpmulKp , clearly indicate a close correlation between MalT binding and the presence of this hexa-nucleotide .

<li>Intriguingly , the presence of malPp DNA causes the MalT polymers to undergo a dramatic conformational change .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , we do not know whether the conformational change that occurs in the presence of malPp involves non-speciï¬c MalT -- DNA interactions or MalT binding to the cognate sites present on the fragment .

<li>Therefore , the presence of MalT site 4 and of the CRP-binding site in maIPp remains unexplained .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>

<li>We verified that , in all cases , ApApC synthesis was proportional to time for at least 40 min after the initiation of the reaction and that it was strictly dependent on the presence of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>

<li>These polypeptides probably corresponded to proteolytic fragments of MalT and MalTc , since all of the strains are isogenic except for the presence of the different alleles of malT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>

<li>In the presence of a DNA fragment containing a MalT-controlled promoter , malPp500 , MalT forms homopolymers with a much smaller radius of curvature and a different conformation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of MalT '' ( maZTCmutation ) or without MalQ ( malQ mutation ) , malK expression more or less depends on pH , .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>

<li>Second , the poly dispersion of the homopolymers revealed by cryo Â¬ EM is consistent with ï¬ltration data , indicating that , in the presence of both an adenine trinucleotide and maltotriose , MalT does not form discrete size multimers , but self-associates into rapidly equilibrating species whose average size monotonically increases with the concentration of the protein .

<li>That MalT is actually monomeric at 1 mM in the presence of maltotriose is consistent with the observation that at low concentration , MalT has a sedimentation coefficient s20 , w of 5.9 S , which corresponds to that of an ' 110-kDa globular protein ( Fig. 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>( Because we could not decrease the concentration of the protein below 2 mM , we do not know whether MalT is dimeric or monomeric at low concentrations in the presence of both maltotriose and AMP-PNP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>The presence of a wild-type malPQ + operon , which encodes enzymes involved in the catabolism of maltodextrins , further increases the concentration of active MalT in a malTp1 malTp7 background ( see below ) , possibly through an effect on the production of maltotriose ( the true inducer ) from maltose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>When a plasmid bearing a malP-lacZ gene fusion was incubated in a coupled transcription-translation system in the presence of wild-type MalT protein , the activation of transcription at malPp and , consequently , the synthesis of the hybrid MalP-LacZ protein were specifically and totally dependent on the presence of maltotriose ( 25 ) ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of maltotriose , the activities of the three proteins were very similar to the activity of wild-type MalT ; half-maximal MalP-LacZ synthesis was reached at about the same MalT concentration ( taking into account the lower degree of purity of MalTc22 ) , and , at a saturating protein concentration , the same amount of MalP-LacZ was synthesized ( Fig. 5 ) ( since all of the properties of MalTC25 and -26 are identical , only the experimental data obtained for MalTC26 are shown in Fig. 5 and 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whereas wild-type MalT activity was absolutely dependent upon the presence of maltotriose , even at high protein concentrations , both mutated proteins were partially active in the absence of this sugar .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of maltotriose , however , wild-type MalT was totally inactive , whereas MalTC22 and -26 were as active as they were in the presence of maltotri-ose , although a higher concentration of protein was required to reach the plateau ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , although t ' he MalT protein is overproduced , the concentration of active MalT protein in the absence of inducer is similar to that found in a partly induced wild type st ' rain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=6379197" target="_blank">6379197</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whereas in an in vitro assay the wild-type MalT protein is inactive in the absence of maltotriose , the MalT ( Con ) proteins are active in the absence of maltotriose but still bind maltotriose with an increased afï¬nity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>The variant assayed is MalT 26 , C which has been characterized previously and shown to be active in vitro in the absence of maltotriose and to display higher affinity for the inducer than the wild-type protein ( Dardonville and Raibaud , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalTC26 , but not MalT , was active in the absence of maltotriose ( Fig. 6 ) , confirming the result obtained in the coupled transcription-translation assay .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>
<li>The in vitro properties of the MalTC proteins described in this paper are also consistent with the second , more classical hypothesis , since the maW7 ` mutations seem to lock MalT in a conformation in which the proteins are active even in the absence of maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MalT-Aes complex is in rapid equilibrium with free MalT and Aes on the time scale of the chromatography , and the apparent molecular mass of the complex increases with increasing concentrations of the partners without reaching a limit value within the protein concentration range used .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>The progressive increase of the apparent mo-lecular mass of the peak of MalT multimers suggests the presence of several multimeric species in rapid equilibrium on the time scale of the chromatography , the position of the peak reflecting the weighted average Stokes radius of the species in equilibrium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>The continuous shift of the peak position is best explained by the presence of several species in rapid equilibrium , e.g. the ( MalT ) n form and lower molecular mass species , the fraction of material in the ( MalT ) n form increasing with the protein concentration .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that malEpKp1 ,2,3 , I3 was not fully active in the MalT overproducing strains was not due to the presence of an excess of MalT because intermediate values were obtained when the variant was assayed in strains overproducing MalT to a lesser extent ( in malTp1 malPQ â or malTp7 malPQ â strains ; data not shown ) .

<li>The outer membrane contains the receptor maltodextrins requires the presence of the regulator protein , for phage X ( 5 ) , which functions as a maltodextrin-specific MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1544897" target="_blank">1544897</a>]<br></li>

<li>The expression of malT is not autoregulated by MalT but is subject to catabolite repression and therefore requires the presence of the cAMP/CAP complex ( 35 , 36 , 65 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>The absence or presence of MalT ( 0.5 PM for Ep236 , Ep225 , Ep204 , Ep193 and Epl68 ; 0.5 and 1.0 PM for Ep92 ; and 1.0 FM for Ep47 ) are marked with - and + signs , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>The cells were grown in minimal medium in the presence of glycerol and maltose , i.e. under conditions in which both MalT and CRP are active .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Table I , MalT binds dATP and AMP-PNP as effectively as ATP , has a relatively high affinity for ADP and GTP , but exhibits only ( Â© ) IRL Press ~ ~ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Fig. 7A , MalY inhibited MalT activity when AMP-PNP was substituted for ATP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Gel filtration experiments were performed in the presence of AMP-PNP , a non-hydrolysable analogue of ATP , or ADP , both of which also function as positive effectors of MalT ( Richet and Raibaud , 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>The weak efficiency of ADP , apparent only at a low concentration of MalT , might therefore simply reflect a 5-times lower affinity of the MalT-ADP form for the mnlPp promoter as compared to the MalT-ATP or MalT-AMP-PNP forms .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>3 Furthermore , the use of AMP-PNP instead of ATP as a positive effector of MalT ensures sample homogeneity by avoiding production of ADP-liganded species .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MalT/ADP Form Is Insensitive to Competition by the Inducer -- Both AMP-PNP and ADP can replace ATP as a positive effector of MalT ( 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>50-fold higher affinity for MalY than AMP-PNP Â± MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nucleotide effect on the affinity of MalT for maltotriose The nucleotide effect on the relative affinities of MalT for maltotriose and MalY could be explained by ( i ) an effect on the activator affinity for maltotriose , i.e. AMP-PNP Â± MalT would have a higher affinity for maltotriose than ADP Â± MalT ; ( ii ) an effect on MalT affinity for MalY , i.e. AMP-PNP Â± MalT would have a lower affinity for MalY than ADP Â± MalT ; or ( iii ) a combination of both effects .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under the assay conditions , the ADP-bound form of MalT has 20-fold lower affinity for maltotriose compared with the AMP-PNP-bound form , too small an effect to account for the .1000 - fold increase in the ratio of the affinity for MalY to the affinity for maltotriose observed under the same conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data reveal that , when present together , maltotriose and AMP-PNP strongly favor the self-association of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Provided that the model proposed is correct , this may mean that the binding of AMP-PNP by the maltotriose-bound form not only results in an increase of the association equilibrium constant of the dimer 3 ( MalT ) n step but that it also increases the association and dissociation rate constants .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>When assayed at 10 ztM in the presence of 0.28 ltM MalT , AMP , cAMP , dGTP , CTP , dCTP , UTP and TTP were totally inactive ( Table I and data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>We clearly establish that : ( i ) the unliganded form of the protein is monomeric ; ( ii ) when present alone , each effector , maltotri-ose or AMP-PNP ( or ATP ) , induces a partial multimerization of MalT ; and ( iii ) MalT self-associates in the presence of both effectors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is unlikely that interactions with the matrix of the Super-dex column ( cross-linked agarose and dextran ) cause the size of the major AMP-PNP/MalT form to be underestimated , because MalT also eluted as a 100-kDa globular protein when filtered at 20 Â° C in the presence of AMP-PNP through a Superose 12 column ( cross-linked agarose only ) ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>That the AMP-PNP bound form of MalT is primarily monomeric is also consistent with the result of a velocity sedimentation experiment performed at 4 Â° C with 11 mM MalT in the presence of AMP-PNP , which gave a sedimentation coefficient s20 , w of 5.4 S for the predominant form ( which corresponds to that of an ' 95-kDa globular protein ) ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , although ADP had a small stimulatory effect when assayed at saturating concentrations in the presence of 0.28 , ^ M MalT ( see Figure 4 ) , full activation could be achieved if the MalT concentration was raised to -1 , uM ( Figure 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Owing to the reduced ability of MalT Â± ADP to promote open complex formation , a higher concentration of MalT had to be used in the assays performed in the presence of ADP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT-ADP is also fully competent for transcription activation in the presence of maltotriose , except that a 5-fold higher concentration of MalT is required to achieve half of the maximum response ( 18 ) .2 Maltotriose and the adenine nucleotides were present at saturating concentrations ( 1 and 0.1 mM , respectively ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similarly , comparative malPp activation assays showed that the ADP-MalT form is fully competent for transcription activation in the presence of maltotriose , except that a 5-fold higher concentration of MalT was required to achieve the half-maximum response compared with what was observed with the AMP-PNP bound forms ( 18 ) .2 ( Both gel filtration and activation assays were performed in the presence of saturating concentrations of ligands , thereby excluding the possibility that the reduced abilities of ADP-MalT to multimerize or activate open complex formation were the result of incomplete saturation of the ligand binding sites .

<li>To find out whether maltotriose antagonizes Aes binding to MalT , we performed gel filtration experiments in the presence of both ATP and 1 mM maltotriose , the concentration of inducer relieving inhibition of wild-type MalT by Aes in our transcription system ( Fig. 2C ) .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Fig. 1B , MalTc26 was scarcely inhibited by Aes in the presence of 0.1 mM maltotriose , i.e. a maltotriose concentration allowing repression of wild-type MalT by Aes ( Fig. 1A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Fig. 2 , transcription activation by MalT 26 was not depressed by C MalY in the presence of 0.1 mM maltotriose , i.e. under conditions in which the wild-type protein was sensitive to MalY ( compare Figs 1 and 2 ) .

<li>Furthermore , gel filtration experiments performed in the presence of 0.5 m AMP-PNP showed that M Aes forms a complex with wild-type MalT , but not with MalT T38R ( data not shown ; Fig. 6A ) , and that MalY forms a complex FIG. 3 .

<li>Effect of MalY on MalT activity in the presence of AMP-PNP or ADP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li></div>
<li>In contrast , as shown for MalY and Aes , inhibition of ADP-bound MalT by MalY or Aes is insensitive to the presence of an excess of maltotriose ( 19 , 20 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , as observed in vitro , the ADP-bound form of MalT remains sensitive to MalY ( 16 ) or Aes ( this work ) even in the presence of an excess of maltotriose ( up to 100 mM ) , whereas inhibition by Aes or MalY of the AMP-PNP bound form of MalT is relieved by 0.1 mM maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of ADP , MalT inhibition by MalY was not relieved by maltotriose , even when present in a large excess ( 100 mM ) , whereas in the presence of AMP-PNP , MalY action was counteracted by 0.1 mM inducer ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of AMP-PNP , MalT inhibition by Aes was relieved by 0.1 mM maltotriose ( Fig. 4A ) , whereas in the presence of ADP , Aes action was not counteracted by maltotriose , even when present at 100 mM ( Fig. 4B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>This possibility was examined by determining the concentration of maltotriose needed to relieve MalT inhibition by a fixed amount of Aes in the presence of AMP-PNP or ADP in our transcription system .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , as shown here , both AMP-PNP and ADP induce self-associa-tion of MalT in the presence of maltotriose , the difference being that association of the ADP-bound forms is less favored ; a 7-fold higher concentration of MalT is required to achieve the same degree of association in the presence of maltotriose 1 ADP as in the presence of maltotriose 1 AMP-PNP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data thus suggest that the concentration of maltotriose required to overcome inhibition by MalY in the presence of ADP would be .1000 times higher than in the presence of AMP-PNP ; in other words , the apparent ratio of MalY affinity to maltotriose affinity is .1000 - fold higher for ADP Â± MalT than for AMP-PNP Â± MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>

<li>Gel filtration of 23 mM MalT in the presence of ATP or ADP gave profiles identical to that obtained with AMP-PNP except that no multimeric species were observed in the presence of ADP ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the Presence of Maltotriose and ATP or ADP -- Gel filtration of MalT in the presence of maltotriose 1 ATP or ADP gave profiles similar to those obtained in the presence of maltotriose and AMP-PNP except that , in both cases , at any MalT concentration tested , the major peak eluted later than observed in the presence of maltotriose and AMP-PNP ( Figs. 6 and 8 , data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that ATP gave an intermediate response close to that obtained with AMP-PNP ( a 10-fold higher concentration of maltotriose was required to antagonize MalY action in the presence of ATP compared with that observed in the presence of AMP-PNP ) might reflect the presence of both ATP-bound and ADP-bound forms resulting from ATP hydrolysis by MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>The experiments were performed in the presence of AMP-PNP ( as shown below , MalT and MalY also form a complex in the presence of AMP-PNP or ADP , which elutes at 1.19 ml , as observed in the presence of ATP ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results obtained in the presence of AMP-PNP instead of ATP were identical to those obtained in the presence of ATP : a MalT Â± MalY complex was observed in the presence of AMP-PNP alone , whereas no complexes were observed in the presence of both AMP-PNP and maltotriose ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MalT Â± MalY complex also assembled in the presence of ADP ( Fig. 6A ) but , surprisingly , its formation was not prevented by the presence of 1 mM maltotriose , in contrast to what was observed with ATP or AMP-PNP ( Fig. 6B ) .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>The assays were performed at limiting MalT concentrations close to those used for MalY assays and chosen in order to give the same signal ( two-thirds of the maximum response ) at saturating concentrations of maltotriose : 150 nM MalT for the assays performed in the presence of AMP-PNP and 500 nM for those performed in the presence of ADP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the Presence of Maltotriose and AMP-PNP -- Gel filtration of MalT at 6 Â° C in the presence of both maltotriose and AMP-PNP gave two peaks , a minor one , corresponding to the mono-meric species , and a major one that was asymmetric and the position of which shifted to smaller retention volumes as MalT concentration was raised ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is somewhat surprising that the dimers and the higher order association species formed in the presence of maltotriose give two distinct peaks , whereas in the presence of both maltotriose and AMP-PNP , one unique peak is obtained , which shifts smoothly toward higher apparent molecular masses as the MalT concentration is raised .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>To ï¬nd out whether the multimeric structures formed by MalT in solution are involved in promoter binding , we observed nucleoprotein complexes formed when incubating MalT in the presence of AMP-PNP , maltotriose and the malPp500 promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consistent with the reduced ability of the maltotriose/ADP pair of effectors to drive MalT self-association , a larger number of isolated , globular forms were , however , visible in the vitreous ice background compared to what observed in the presence of maltotriose and AMP-PNP ( compare Figure 1A and B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the observation that , in the presence of maltotriose , AMP-PNP favors MalT multim-erization to a greater extent than ADP suggests that in vivo ATP hydrolysis by MalT might be coupled to the disassembly of the multimer formed by the protein or of the nucleoprotein structures assembled at the mal promoters .

<li>All rights reserved Results Cryo-EM analysis of MalT self-associated species Adenylyl imidodiphosphate ( AMP-PNP ) , a nonhydrolysable analog of ATP , is slightly more effective than ATP in driving MalT self-association in the presence of maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>ATP and AMP-PNP , a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP , are equally effective in promoting activation of transcription by MalT in the presence of maltotriose ( 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Third , there is a correlation between the relative abilities of AMP-PNP and ADP to promote the self-association of MalT and transcription activation in the presence of maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>

<li>Thus , both ATP and ADP promote MalT self-association in the presence of malto-triose , but ADP is clearly less effective than ATP , which is itself less effective than AMP-PNP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of maltotriose 1 ATP , the degree of association of MalT is intermediate between that observed in the presence of maltotriose 1 AMP-PNP and that observed in the presence of maltotriose 1 ADP ; this is best explained by the presence of both ATP - and ADP-bound forms due to ATP hydrolysis by the protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>2 AMP-PNP , which can replace ATP as an effector of MalT ( 33 ) , is actually more effective than ATP in driving MalT self-association in the presence of maltotriose due to the absence of ATP hydrolysis , which generates ADP-bound forms that are less prone to multimerization ( 16 ) .

<li>In the presence of maltotriose 1 ATP , an ' 2-fold higher concentration of MalT was required to obtain the same apparent molecular mass as in the presence of maltotriose 1 AMP-PNP , whereas an ' 7-fold higher concentration of MalT was required to obtain the same apparent molecular mass in the presence of maltotriose 1 ADP .

<li>Using an abortive initiation assay , we further show that activation of open complex formation by MalT depends on the presence of ATP in addition to that of maltotriose , the inducer of the maltose system .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Gel filtration of a mixture containing both proteins in the presence of ATP and maltotriose gave two peaks , at 1.11 and 1.32 ml , i.e. the volumes at which MalT and MalY , respectively , elute when filtered separately .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT was preincubated with malPp in the presence of ATP , maltotriose , and various concentrations of Aes before adding RNA polym-erase and allowing open complex formation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT was preincubated with malPp DNA , ATP and maltotriose in the presence or absence of MalY , before adding RNA polymerase and allowing open complex formation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , in the presence of ATP , MalT and MalY form a complex , the apparent molecular weight of which is 165 kDa .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , we showed that the formation of a MalY Â± MalT complex is a reversible reaction : when MalT and MalY were first preincubated together in the presence of ATP alone , before incubation and gel filtration in the presence of maltotriose 1 ATP , few complexes , if any , were observed ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , this result clearly demonstrates that , in the presence of ATP , maltotriose inhibits formation of the MalT Â± MalY complex and makes us confident that the MalT Â± MalY interaction seen here is functionally relevant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Assembly of the complex between MalY and ADP-MalT is thus less sensitive to the presence of maltotriose than that observed for the ATP-bound form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription activation by MalT involves cooperative binding of the protein to an array of sites located upstream from the 35 region of the target promoters and requires the presence of two positive effectors , maltotriose ( the inducer ) and ATP ( reviewed in Ref .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription activation by MalT depends on the presence of ATP and maltotriose , two effectors of the protein ( Raibaud and Richet , 1987 ; Richet and Raibaud , 1989 ) , and involves MalT binding to an array of sites located upstream of the ` 235 ' region of the mal promoters ( Boos and Shuman , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of maltotriose and ATP , MalT , the activator protein specific for the regulon , binds to a short asymmetrical sequence which is present in several copies in alt the MalT-dependent promoters ( Vidal-lngigiiardi etai , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of ATP and maltotriose , MalT binds to decanucleotide MalT boxes that are found upstream of mal promoters and activates transcription at these sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , we infer that , at least up to this step , ATP merely acts as an allosteric-effector , i.e. that neither the potential energy of ATP hydrolysis nor the phosphorylation of MalT or maltotriose are needed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two small effectors , maltotriose and ATP , specifically bind to MalT and are absolutely required for its activity ( 25 , 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>
<li>Figure 6 shows that MalT binds to the MalT boxes only if ATP and maltotriose are present together .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT also binds and 2,8 -- 10 hydrolyses ATP into ADP , with ATP and ADP differentially affecting the interplay between maltotriose and the negative effectors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vitro , both ATP and ADP promote maltotriose binding and MalT self-associa-tion ( Fig. 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>From these data , we conclude that the role of maltotriose and ATP as positive effectors is to induce the multimerization of MalT , and hence its cooperative binding to the mal promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both these properties suggest that maltotriose binding and ATP binding are co-operative , consistent with the fact that these two effectors promote MalT oligomerization when present together .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>We show that the unliganded form of MalT is monomeric and that maltotriose and ATP induce the multimerization of the activator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Note that AMP-PNP can replace ATP as a positive effector of MalT , and that the 2 AMP-PNP-bound form is partially active in the absence of maltotriose Figure 4 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Cryo-15 electron microscopy showed that , in the active form , i.e. in the presence of both ATP and maltotriose , MalT monomers consist of a globular domain connected by a peduncle to an inner domain , that mediates self-association into polydisperse homopolymers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Efï¬cient MalT multimerization requires ATP or ADP in addition to maltotriose , with ATP being more effective than ADP in driving MalT self-association in the presence of maltotriose , indicating that the maltotriose/ATP-bound form is the transcriptionally active species .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>ATP-bound MalT is more prone to multimerization in the presence of maltotriose than is the ADP-bound form ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of ADP and maltotriose , MalT has an apparent molecular weight ( 174 kDa ) lower than that observed in the presence of ATP and maltotriose , consistent with the fact that ADP Â± MalT has a reduced tendency to multimerize compared with ATP Â± MalT ( Schreiber and Richet , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both maltotriose and ATP are required for the act , ivit , y of MalT ( Raibaud & Richet , 1987 ; Richet & Raibaud , 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2016744" target="_blank">2016744</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , ATP Â± MalT has a higher affinity for maltotriose than ADP Â± MalT , whereas MalT has a higher affinity for ATP than ADP in the presence of maltotriose ( Richet and Raibaud , 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>When chromatographed alone , Aes eluted at the same position as described above , whereas MalT eluted as a 300-kDa protein , consistent with the fact that MalT is multimeric in the presence of ATP and maltotriose ( 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Considering that maltotriose and/or ATP might regulate the oli-gomerization of the protein , we studied both the liganded and the unliganded forms of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>One trivial explanation is that the purified MalT protein is a mixture of MalT molecules either unable to-bind ATP , able to-bind ATP only in the presence of maltotriose , or able to-bind ATP independently of the presence of maltotriose , which are present in the ratio 2 : 1 : 1 , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent studies have revealed that the unliganded form of MalT is monomeric in solution and that the protein self-associates in the presence of ATP and maltotriose ( Schreiber and Richet , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Role of ATP in activation of transcription initiation by MalT The main conclusion of this work is that activation of transcription initiation by MalT requires , in addition to maltotriose , the presence of ATP ( or dATP ) as an effector of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The footprinting assays were performed in the presence of ATP and maltotriose , both of which are required for MalT to-bind to DNA ( E. Richet , unpublished results ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>The regulation of this system is based on the function of MalT , which becomes an activator in the presence of cyclic AMP-catabolite activator protein , ATP and maltotriose , the speciï¬c inducer of the system ( 38 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9401025" target="_blank">9401025</a>]<br></li>
<li>DISCUSSION Ligand-induced Self-association of MalT -- The results of the gel filtration and sedimentation experiments reported in this paper reveal several features of the association state of MalT in the absence or presence of its effectors , maltotriose and ATP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MalT protein hydrolyses dATP as effectively as ATP in the absence and in the presence of maltotriose ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The assay of MalT after filtration of a 20 mM sample in the absence of ligands and after filtration of a 6.4 mM sample in the presence of maltotriose and ATP showed that the protein was ' 100 and ' 80 % active , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT binding to the MalT box depends on the presence of both maltotriose and A TP We next examined whether both ATP and maltotriose , or only one of them , were required for the binding of MalT to its recognition sequences in the promoter , one of the first steps of the activation process .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown by DNase I footprinting , MalT binding to its recognition sites present in the malEp - malKp promoters depends on the presence of both ATP and maltotriose , which indicates that both of them are required at an early stage of the transcription initiation process .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Inducer binding was measured by incubating MalT with ATP and [ C ] -14 maltotriose for 15 min at 308C in the presence or absence of MalY and counting the radioactivity present in the pellet after ammonium sulphate precipitation of the proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of ATP , MalT is activated by binding maltotriose , the inducer of the system ( 54 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9023215" target="_blank">9023215</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alternatively , a MalT monomer may possess two distinct ATP-binding sites , one of them binding ATP only in the presence of maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Surprisingly , the stoichiometry of the binding of ATP is 0.25 and 0.5 molecules of ATP per monomer of MalT in the absence and in the presence of maltotriose , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Second , both MalT oligomerization and promoter binding depend on the presence of ATP and maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both techniques indicate that , in the presence of maltotriose , MalT binds 0.5 molecules of ATP per monomer with a Kd of 0.6 AM ( equilibrium dialysis ) or 0.4 izM ( ammonium sulphate precipitation ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT binds and activates its target promoters ( 29 ) only in the presence of ATP ( 34 ) and the inducer maltotriose ( 28 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Little is known , however , about the multimeric species formed by MalT in solution in the presence of ATP and maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT is active only in the presence of ATP and maltotriose , both of which are required for multimerization ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>To obtain more quantitative data on these interactions , we measured [ H ] ATP binding to MalT by two different techniques : equilibrium dialysis and ammonium sulphate precipitation of the nucleotide - MalT complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>As already observed for ATP binding , no stimulatory effect was observed when maltose and maltotetraose , two maltodextrins which are not effectors of MalT for transcription activation , were substituted for maltotriose ( Figure 2B and data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The binding of ATP ( K , 0.4 pM ; Richet & Raibaud , 1989 ) and maltotriose ( K , about 2 0 p M ; Raibaud & Richet , 1987 ) to MalT , stabilizes active MalT ( MalT , ) for transcriptional activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of these genes is controlled by the MalT protein , a 103 kDa monomer that binds ATP and maltotriose ( Richet and Raibaud , 1987 ; Dardonville and Raibaud , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT self-associa-tion , which is expected to be crucial for promoter binding , is hence the target of several of the controls to which the activator is subjected , i.e. the inducer , ATP , and ATP hydrolysis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , no [ 3H ] ATP-binding to the protein was detected when ammonium sulphate was added immediately after mixing ATP and MalT , and no loss of incorporated [ 3H ] ATP was observed when a large excess of unlabelled ATP was added together with the ammonium sulphate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>A simple model is that binding of both ATP and maltotriose drive MalT protein into a conformation appropriate for binding of a MalT box .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>ATP binding to the MalT protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Self-association of MalT , a Checkpoint -- One major conclusion of this work is that maltotriose and ATP regulate MalT activity by controlling the self-association of the protein , a step thought to precede or accompany cooperative binding of the activator to promoter DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>As revealed by DNase I footprinting , both ATP and maltotriose are required for the binding of the MalT protein to the mal promoter DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT binds two ligands , maltotriose and ( d ) ATP , both of which are required for binding to promoter DNA ( 5 , 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>This seems rather unlikely since the Kd value of MalT for ATP is 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than the intracellular concentration of ATP ( Chapman and Atkinson , 1973 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The binding of ATP to MalT depends strictly on the presence of Mg2 , as is usually observed for nucleotide-binding proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The affinity of MalT for other nucleotides was determined by measuring their competitive effect on [ 3H ] ATP binding to MalT using both techniques .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The plateau was reached with 1 ATP , and half maximal activity of MalT was obtained , tM-with 0.2 / LM ATP , a value consistent with the Kd measured above ( Table I ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The intermediate results obtained with ATP are best explained by the presence of both ATP - and ADP-bound forms of MalT due to ATP hydrolysis during the assay .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>The equilibrium between the various MalT species also depends on whether MalT is liganded to ATP or ADP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>The amount of ATP bound to MalT was calculated by using the mean value of the 4.5 and 5.5 h samplings .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The turn-over number of ATP hydrolysis was low , about 0.08 mol of ATP hydrolysed/min/mol of MalT ( Figure 2A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The event that would cause ATP hydrolysis and the MalT form that undergoes ATP hydrolysis are both unknown .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>In its absence , only 0.25 molecules of ATP were bound per monomer of MalT , with a Kd of 0.7 , uM ( Figure 1B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>ATP-free MalT was prepared , and MalT monomer concentrations were determined as described by Schreiber and Richet ( 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>50-fold higher affinity for ADP Â± MalT than for ATP Â± MalT ( this work ) is unclear .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>No ApApC synthesis was detected in the absence of ATP at 0.28 / tM MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>So far , the role of ATP as an effector of MalT is unknown .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT preparations devoid of ATP were obtained as follows .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , the ability of MalY to repress MalT , irrespective of whether the activator is liganded to ATP or a non-hydrolysable analogue , is evidence that MalY action is not coupled to ATP hydrolysis by MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>3 ADP can replace ATP as a positive effector of MalT in vitro , but it is less effective than ATP in shifting the equilibrium toward the transcriptionally competent form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the fact that a very high concentration of maltotriose is required in vitro to overcome repression by MalY when MalT is bound to ADP makes it unlikely that MalY sequesters MalT in the ADP-bound form , unless one assumes a rapid exchange between ADP and ATP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>We do not know whether , in vivo , the inactive form of MalT stabilized by MalY is in an ATP - or ADP-bound state .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both the ATP-bound and the ADP-bound forms of MalT are in equilibrium between inactive and active monomeric forms designated a and i , respectively , in the case of ATP/MalT and a and i , respectively , in the case of ADP/MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Theoretically , both the inactive and the active forms may exist as ATP - or ADP-bound forms , as both ATP Â± MalT and ADP Â± MalT can bind MalY or bind maltotriose and oligomerize .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>The malTc26 mutation , which generates the R242P substitution in the DT1-DT2 linker , confers constitutive expression of the maltose regulon by favoring the transition from the inactive state to the active state of MalT ( 18 , 21 ) , and it is known to abolish MalT sensitivity to Aes in vivo ( 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>The transition between the inactive and the active form of MalT involves DT1 , DT2 , and DT3 , three domains that are specific to the MalT family of transcriptional-activators and are thought to constitute a signal integration module ( 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mutation malTc26 , which corresponds to the R242P substitution in the DT1-DT2 linker , is indeed known to shift the equilibrium toward the active form of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT appears monomeric in solution and , in the absence of inducer , is in an inactive form ( MalT , ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalY most likely stabilizes MalT in its inactive ( monomeric ) form ( 37 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , they might all interact with MalT and keep it in the monomeric ( inactive ) form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>The monomeric , inactive MalT form ( Ti ) is in equilibrium with the monomeric , active form ( Ta ) , which is prone to multimerization .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to the current 13 model , MalT exists in equilibrium between an inactive monomeric form and an active monomeric form that is prone to multimerization .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to available data , the unliganded form of MalT is in equilibrium between a monomeric , inactive form and a monomeric active form that is prone to multimerise .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Available data suggest that unliganded MalT is in equilibrium between an inactive monomeric form and an active monomeric form prone to self-association .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>The available data are consistent with a model in which MalT is in equilibrium between two forms : an inactive , monomeric form stabilized by MalY and an active , monomeric form stabilized by maltotriose and prone to multimerize .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our data are consistent with the simple model proposed by Boos and Shuman ( 1998 ) , according to which MalT would exist in an equilibrium between two forms , an inactive form stabilized by MalY and an active form stabilized by maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>All of the available data suggest a model in which MalT exists in an equilibrium between an inactive form stabilized by repressor binding and an active form stabilized by maltotriose binding and prone to multimerization ( 37 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to our working model , the unliganded form of MalT is in equilibrium between an inactive , monomeric form and an active monomeric form that is stabilized by maltotriose and prone to multimerise , provided that ATP is present .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT is in equilibrium between an inactive and an active form with the negative effector stabilizing the inactive form and maltotriose stabilizing the active form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>As revealed by limited proteolysis , maltotriose binding triggers a conformational change in MalT that involves domains 1 -- 3 and most likely reflects part of the postulated transition from the inactive form to the active form of MalT ( 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , these results indicate that the T38R substitution does not alter the balance between the inactive and the active foms of MalT , nor does it increase MalT affinity for maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>c The malT 26 mutation , which generates the R242P substitution in the DT1-DT2 linker , increases the affinity of MalT for maltotriose by favoring the transition from the inactive state to the active state ( 9 , 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>As indicated by the absence of an effect on the intrinsic ability of MalT to activate transcription initiation , the amino acid changes caused by the up mutations do not grossly disturb DT3 structure nor alter a DT3 surface element that would play a key role in the stabilization of the active form of MalT or any subsequent step .

<li>Based on the known ability of the MalT protein to form multimers and to-bind to T boxes , we believe that either the hybrid protein forms inactive mixed oligo-mers with wild-type MalT protein or that it simply occupies MalT boxes but is unable to activate transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>We had previously shown that , although excess MalK protein inhibits transcription of mal genes by wild-type MalT , a mutant form of MalT that is constitutively in the active form , MalT1 ( Con ) ( Dardonville and Raibaud , 1990 ) , is resistant to MalK-mediated repression ( Reyes and Shuman , 1988 ; and see below ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>We show that Aes alone interferes with transcription activation by MalT in a purified transcription system and that Aes acts via the same mechanism as MalY , although their cognate recognition sites on MalT are likely to be distinct .

<li>ATP Â± MalT is more effective than ADP Â± MalT in oligomerizing and promoting transcription activation , which indicates that ATP/maltotriose/MalT is the species responsible for the transcriptional activity and that ATP hydrolysis might be coupled to the disassembly of oligomeric structures ( Schreiber and Richet , 1999 ) .

<li>MalT has a weak intrinsic ATPase activity If ATP is used by MalT as an energy donor to drive some conformational change or as a Pi donor to phosphorylate Abortive initiation at malPp , a new assay for MalT The ability of MalT to-bind ATP suggested that ATP might be involved in the transcription activation process .

<li>First , the fact that the presence of a MalT box at this position is the unique feature common to all the MalT-dependent promoters suggests that this binding site plays a key role in transcription activation ( Chapon & Raibaud , 1985 ) .

<li>Sequence conservation in the carboxyl-terminal activation module is found among numerous transcription activators , some of which ( NarL , DegU , FixJ , ComA , etc. ) are parts of two-component regulatory systems , whereas others ( LuxR , MalT , etc. ) are apparently regulated by direct ligand binding and not by protein phosphorylation ( Henikoff et aI .

<li>In this respect , it will be interesting to understand how all of these signals are integrated at the level of the protein and , in particular , to identify the conformational changes that are involved in the transition between the inactive and the active forms and to determine the role that the ATPase activity of MalT plays in the control of this interconversion .

<li>To ï¬nd out whether the MalK916 protein was unable to anatgonize MalT activity because of an inability to interact with the MalT protein , we performed an experiment similar to that shown in Fig. 1C , this time using the GST -- MalT protein bound to glutathione-agarose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>As in the case of MalT1 ( Con ) , it seems unlikely that the inability of the MalK916 protein to antagonize MalT activity can be explained by a lack of ability to-bind MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>This interpretation was confirmed by showing that filtration of samples containing MalT and Aes in a 2:1 or 1:2 ratio ( 18 M MalT 9.5 M Aes or 9 M MalT 19 M Aes ) gave an additional peak at the position at which the protein present in excess is expected to elute ( data not shown ) .

<li>This conclusion is consistent with the 1sedimentation coefficient s20 , w of MalT ( 5.8 S ) meas-ured by sedimentation through a sucrose gradient in the absence of ligands , which corresponds to that of an ' 105-kDa globular protein ( Fig. 3A ) .

<li>In the absence of Aes , MalT eluted as a 96-kDa globular protein ( elution volume , 1.30 ml ) , consistent with the fact that MalT is mainly monomeric under these conditions ( 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>When only MalT is present ( and provided it is overproduced ) , the protein specifically binds to the MalT boxes through their major groove , and initiates the formation of an aggregate of MalT monomers around which the intervening sequence is wrapped .

<li>A better understanding of how MalT binds the array of MalT sites present in the mal promoters should be provided by the knowledge of the association state of the protein in solution .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MalT protein , which is the activator at all mal promoters ( 112 , 206 , 214 ) , and the sites at which it binds ( MalT boxes ) have provided an important alternative view to the lac operon about how transcription is activated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Higher concentrations of the protein were reproducibly inhibitory , a phenomenon which might , be related to the slight inhibition seen in ~ dz * o when MalT is overproduced ( Schwartz , 1987 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2016744" target="_blank">2016744</a>]<br></li>

<li>This requirement for ATP is a property which , together with other features of the MalT protein ( its size and the asymmetry of its recognition sequence ) distinguishes it from the classical bacterial regulators such as the CI or the CRP proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the MalT protein was compared with the HtpR , RpoD , OmpR , CAP or Fnr proteins of E. cold , together with the N , CI and CII proteins of bacteriophage i , no significant homologies were detected .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3015733" target="_blank">3015733</a>]<br></li>
<li>We therefore searched for assay conditions under which the MalT protein would still be active at the end of the assay , even when ATP was omitted .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Controls showed that , even in the absence of ATP , MalT protein was still active at the end of the assay , thus ruling out a mere stabilizing effect of ATP ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Neither the requirement for maltotriose nor the requirement for ATP reflect a stabilizing effect on MalT activity ; the protein was still active at the end of the assay even if one effector had been omitted ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is tempting to propose that , in all of these cases , ATP hydrolysis is coupled to dissociation of the oligo-meric structure formed by the protein , as inferred for XylR ( 28 ) and as suggested for MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>ATP-free MalT was prepared by precipitating 5 the puriï¬ed protein with ammonium sulfate in the absence of ATP , washing the pellet and ï¬ltering the resuspended material through a G-75-Sephadex column according to Schreiber et al. .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , in their experiments the immobilized MalT protein might be unfolded because of the absence of ATP during the extraction process ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>When ATP is bound to MalK ( but not hydrolyzed due to the absence of triggering substrate-loaded MBP ) , the protein is a repressor and interacts with MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conclude that the low levels of MalT detected in these strains were due to the absence of H-NS , which appeared to play a positive role in malT gene expression at the level of translation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9829919" target="_blank">9829919</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the malT promoter is controlled by the cAMP-CRP complex , we considered the possibility that the decreased expression of MalT observed in hns and hns-stpA strains was in part also due to a reduced level of cAMP-CRP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9829919" target="_blank">9829919</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test this hypothesis , we added pHA7 * to the malT-lacZ fusion strains to see if excess active CRP levels would restore the levels of MalT expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9829919" target="_blank">9829919</a>]<br></li>

<li>Second , mutations in malF and malG that result in high constitutive levels of MalK ATPase activity ( 41 , 57 ) show a high level of mal gene expression in the absence of inducer , presumably because the ATP-hydrolyzing form of MalK is mimicking transport activity and is unable to repress MalT activity ( 183 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>We reasoned that mutations that cause high levels of MalK ATPase activity should have the opposite effect of MalK941 ; that is , a reduced ability to antagonize MalT activity and therefore result in constitutive mal gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fitting this strain with chromosomal levels of wild-type malT or with the different malT mutations , we used mal gene expression in the absence or presence of each individual plas-mid-encoded repressor as a means to test the interaction of the three repressors with these mutant MalT proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been established previously that , in a wild-type strain , MalT is limiting , as mutations that increase the amount of MalT increase mal gene expression as well ( Chapon , 1982b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under the chosen conditions , mal gene expression controlled by wild-type MalT was inhibited 7.5-fold by MalK , whereas the elevated mal gene expression caused by the MalT mutant proteins was inhibited by MalK from 3.3 - ( T38R ) to 52-fold ( R242C ) ( pmalK column in Table 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Among the 26 MalT mutations , there were none that exhibited wild-type mal gene expression in the absence of MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>With plasmid-encoded Aes , mal gene expression controlled by wild-type MalT was inhibited more than 7.5-fold , whereas several MalT variants were hardly affected ( only one - to twofold inhibition ; paes column in Table 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , these mutant MalT proteins were as sensitive to Aes as wild-type MalT or even more sensitive ( 7.5 - versus 20-fold inhibition ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , increased mal gene expression in these MalT mutants must have been caused solely by a change in the equilibrium towards the active form of MalT without altering appreciably the binding sites for any of the repressors .

<li>However , as shown by Schlegel et al. , ( 33 ) the T38R substitution , isolated2 by Notley-McRobb and Ferenci ( 32 ) and located in MalT domain 1 ( DT1 ) , renders the protein insensitive to Aes in vivo , whereas it slightly increases its sensitivity to MalY , thereby suggesting that the substitution specifically alters the Aes binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Several lines of evidence suggest that MalT is the target of the three repressor proteins : ( i ) overexpression of MalT relieves repression by MalK and Aes ( Peist et al. , 1997 ; Panagiotidis et al. , 1998 ) ; ( ii ) MalK titrates MalT in vivo ( Panagiotidis et al. , 1998 ) ; and ( iii ) a malT c strain , which constitutively expresses the maltose system in vivo , is largely insensitive to repression by MalK , MalY and Aes ( Reyes and Shuman , 1988 ; Reidl et al. , 1989 ; Peist et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>A MalT variant is largely insensitive to repression by c MalY in vitro In vivo , the malT 1 mutation , which confers constitutive c expression of the maltose regulon , suppresses repression by MalY ( Reidl et al. , 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Given that the ATPase activity of MalT does not play any role in the activation of open complex formation ( 5 ) , it is tempting to propose that it actually plays a role in the negative control of MalT activity and that the MalT/ADP form is the actual target of MalY and Aes in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data suggest that 8,9 the ATPase activity of MalT might play a role in the competition between the positive and negative effectors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>The differential effects of ATP and ADP on the competition between the inducer and Aes ( or MalY ) suggest that the ATPase activity displayed by MalT plays a role in the negative control of its activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>The differential effects of ATP 9,10 and ADP on the competition between maltotriose and negative effectors suggest that the ATPase activity displayed by MalT might play a role in the control of the activator activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>The requirement for ATP as a positive effector of MalT might reflect a role for the ATPase activity of MalT in the competition between positive and negative effectors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>One likely explanation is that the retention effects ( Silhavy et al. , 1975 ) and the slow kinetics of the interaction between MalT and ATP ( see below ) together result in the freezing of the equilibrium upon addition of ammonium sulphate at 0 Â° C .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>One such example is the TyrR regulator , which does not belong to the MalT family of transcriptional-activators and whose activity is modulated differentially by three ligands : ATP , tyrosine and phenylalanine ( Wilson et al. , 1995 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has also been demonstrated that MalK , a component of the ABC-type transporter for maltose , physically interacts with MalT to downregulate its transcriptional activity in response to the levels of ATP hydrolysis associated with maltose transport ( Panagiotidis et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>Panagiotidis et al. ( 11 ) observed that a MalK variant that binds but does not hydrolyze ATP has a super-repressor phenotype , whereas MBP-independent transporter variants with high ATPase activity , even in the absence of transportable substrate , show a reduced ability to repress MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>We verified that the concentrations of wild-type MalT , MalTc26 , and MalTT38R in the assays were limiting , i.e. that the absence of an inhibitory effect was meaningful ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Likewise , the T38R MalT variant , which is insensitive to repression by MalK , did not bind MalK , nor does wild-type MalT bind MalK-G346S , the MalK variant defective in MalT regulation ( Fig. 3 , C and D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>B , closed squares , 240 nM wild-type MalT wild-type MalK ; open diamonds , 240 nM wild-type MalT MalK-G346S .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Figure 4 , a fraction of the wild-type MalT protein was retained on the column and co-eluted with MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the amount of wild-type MalK that bound to the glutathione-agarose in the presence of GST was much less than that found in the presence of GST-MalT , the results with the MalK916 protein were less clear .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>To our knowledge , MalT is the fourth type of prokaryotic regulator with the association state shown to be modulated by the binding of ligands .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Fig. 4 , wild-type MalK markedly reduced maltotriose binding by wild-type MalT , whereas it had no significant effect on maltotriose binding by MalTc26 or MalT-T38R .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , as predicted , G346S MalK does not prevent maltotriose binding by wild-type MalT ( Fig. 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Fig. 3 , Aes reduced the amount of maltotriose bound by wild-type MalT by about two-thirds , whereas it did not affect maltotriose binding by the FIG. 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Fig. 5 , MalY markedly decreased the amount of maltotriose bound by wild-type MalT , whereas , as expected , it had no effect on maltotriose binding by the MalT 26 variant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>It should be pointed out that , although both promoters function only in the presenceof CRP in a wild-type strain , they are partially active in a crpbackground provided that MalT is overproduced .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>Controls showed that malEp + is slightly more active in the malPQ â overproducing strain while it is marginally less active in the malPQ + overproducing strain ( Table 1 ) , which indicates that MalT overproduction does not lead to promoter inhibition , at least in the case of the wild-type promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , if the MalK941 mutant regulatory properties are dominant to wild type , we would conclude that the increased ability to antagonize MalT activity is due to a gain of function .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>To make sure that the in vitro activity of the wild-type promoter was not inhibited by 300 nM MalT , we also performed a set of such maiPp allele ' Gly Gty + Mal Gly-h Mai a. All ot the strains were derived from pop1951 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>the in vitro activity of the malPp15 variant was measured by this test ( Fig. 7 ) ; it was also found to be very iow , although in the case of this variant , the binding of MalT to sites 1-3 was strictly identical to that observed on the wild-type promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>malT and malK Mutations Relieving MalT Inhibition by MalK in Vivo Also Suppress the Inhibitory Effect of MalK in Vitro -- To confirm that the inhibition caused by MalK in vitro is functionally significant , we examined whether two different malT mutations that are known to confer resistance to MalK in c vivo ( malT 26 and malT-T38R ) have the same effect in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Repression of MalT Activity by MalK Involves a Direct Interaction between MalK and MalT -- Having established an in vitro repression system mimicking in vivo events , we characterized the repression process and tested the simple hypothesis that MalT inhibition by MalK involves formation of a MalKMalT complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vivo characterization of the malT T38R mutant revealed that besides rendering MalT fully resistant to repression by Aes , the mutation also significantly decreases MalT sensitivity to repression by MalK ( 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vivo and in vitro analyses revealed that the substitutions altering the so-called H10/H11 motif do not affect the ability of MalT to activate transcription or its sensitivity to MalY and Aes , but dramatically decrease its sensitivity to MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vivo and in vitro characterization of the mutated MalT proteins provides compelling evidence that the substitutions do not signiï¬cantly impair the intrinsic ability of MalT to activate transcription initiation , but speciï¬cally render MalT resistant to the inhibition by MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>This last property may explain why the substitution has been selected in a glucose-limited chemostat ( 32 ) ( by reducing MalT sensitivity to repression by MalK in the absence of exogenous maltodextrins , the T38R substitution would lead to an increased basal expression of the LamB porin ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the existence of two distant half-sites on MalK whose spatial relationship depends on whether MalK is in the open or the closed conformation , i.e. on whether the transporter is resting or actively transporting maltodextrins , 24 explains how the ability of MalK to interact with MalT might be coupled to the absence of transport .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has not escaped our attention that the different abilities of MalK to regulate MalT , depending on the occupancy of MalK by different nucleotides bears at least superï¬cial resemblance to the manner in which GTP-bind-ing proteins transmit information about receptor occupancy to various output functions in eukaryotic cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT control by MalK was first recognized with the finding that malK null mutants express constitutively the maltose regulon , whereas MalK overproduction blocks mal gene induction ( 5 , 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>The observation that the repression by MalK is relieved both by MalT overexpression and by a class of malT mutations ( malTc ) that confer constitutive expression of the maltose regulon suggested further that MalT is the target of the negative control exerted by MalK ( 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Control of MalT 9 -- 11 activity by MalK , the ATP-binding component of the maltodextrin transporter , is thought to couple the induction of the maltose regulon to the entry of maltodextrins into the cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Control of MalT 8 -- 10 activity by MalK is thought to couple induction of the maltose regulon to the entry of maltodextrins into the cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>The observation that transport of maltodextrins alone in the apparent absence of internal maltotriose can elicit induction poses an inherent problem : the activity of MalT can be controlled ( inhibited ) by the interaction with MalK , representing transport-controlled induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16321936" target="_blank">16321936</a>]<br></li>
<li>Genetic data suggest that MalK acts as a repressor of MalT when the maltodextrin transport system is resting , thereby preventing induction of the maltose regulon by endogenous maltotriose in the absence of maltodextrins in the growth medium ( 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT repression by MalK ensures that the maltose regulon is not induced by endogenous maltotriose , the inducer of the system , in the absence of external maltodextrins ( 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the accompanying paper ( 17 ) , where we discuss the osmoregulation of endogenous induction , we come to the conclusion that , aside from the glycogen-de-rived inducer maltotriose that is sensitive to MalZ , there exists glycogen-independent endogenous induction that is insensitive to MalZ and therefore must be caused by an inducer distinct from maltotriose that is able to activate MalT when MalK is not inhibiting MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16321936" target="_blank">16321936</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also , when maltose enters the cell via a constitutive transport system for trehalose ( see below ) , an inducer that renders MalT insensitive to overproduction of MalK as well as MalY can be formed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of maltose , the afï¬nity of MalK for MalFG is lowered and it becomes available to interact with MalT , keeping MalT in its inactive state as a mal gene transcriptional-activator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the Maltose/Maltodextrin transport system , MalT , when stabilized by the inducer malto-triose , acts as a transcriptional-activator , whereas stabilization by MalK renders MalT inactive ( reviewed in Boos & Bohm , 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16451192" target="_blank">16451192</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , when stabilized by inducer , MalT would be able to act as a transcriptional-activator ( 66 ) , whereas when stabilized by MalK , it would be inactive .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to its role in transport , MalK influences maltose gene expression , probably by competing with the endogenous inducer for MalT , .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of substrate to be transported , MalK would shift to the transport conformation allowing MalT to function as mal gene activator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Based on the isolation of MalK-insensitive mutants , we had concluded previously that MalK-mediated mal gene repression is dependent on an additional protein , thus excluding a direct interaction between MalK and MalT ( Boos et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>Panagiotidis et al. ( 11 ) observed a MalT-MalK interaction in vitro , but this MalTMalK complex did not respond to signals known to relieve MalT repression by MalK in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , aside from the demonstration that MalK interacts with MalT in vitro ( Panagiotidis et al. , 1998 ) , direct evidence for this model is either scarce or lacking .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>As demonstrated by Joly et al. , MalT 10 inhibition by MalK can be reproduced in a puriï¬ed transcription system by using the soluble form of MalK as a model substrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Decker et al. ( 1993 ) postulated that in the absence of MalK , MalT would not require an inducer to be active .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>A putative function of MalK would be to compete with the endogenous inducer for binding to MalT , ( Decker et al. , 1993 ) , leading to lower amounts of MalT , available for conversion into MalT , .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the basis of genetic data , Panagiotidis et al. ( 11 ) proposed that only the ATP-bound form of MalK , which is expected to predominate when the transporter is resting , is able to repress MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Based on the properties of mutant forms of MalK , it appears that the inactive ATP-bound form of MalK is able to antagonize the ability of MalT to activate transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>The working model for its function predicts that , in the absence of transport , under conditions when ATP is bound to but not hydrolyzed by transport complex-engaged MalK , MalT is likely to be seques-tered by MalK in monomeric ( inactive ) form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Instead , the inducer and the malTc26 mutation probably antagonize MalK binding indirectly by stabilizing the active form of MalT , i.e. the form in which the MalK binding site is either masked or has a reduced affinity for MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that , even if mutations in the MalK binding site are among these mutations , they will simultaneously shift MalT to its active , multimeric form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>( iii ) MalK could act as an enzyme that either polymerizes or degrades the internal inducer into a form which can no longer be recognized by MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2423504" target="_blank">2423504</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , MalK and the inducer would compete for MalT , shifting the equilibrium either with maltotriose to the inducing conformation or with MalK to the inactive form , causing repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , which form of MalK down-regulates MalT in vivo , the MalFGK2 transporter or a soluble MalK form that would cycle between the membrane and the cytoplasm ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results are consistent with a model in which the inactive form of MalK down-modulates MalT and decreases transcription , whereas the active form of MalK does not .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results support the hypothesis that in vivo , the activated form of MalK is less able to antagonize MalT activity than the inactive form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MalK-binding site might result from the juxtaposition of the DT1 and DT3 determinants that would occur when MalT is in the inactive form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alternatively , the DT1 and DT3 determinants recognized by MalK might not be close to each other in the inactive form of MalT , and might correspond to two distinct patches recognized by MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>10 Finally , it remains possible that the H10/H11 motif is not recognized by MalK but , instead , is involved in the stabilization of the MalT inactive form recognized by MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , such a hypothesis implies that the active form of MalT would be in equilibrium with at least two different inactive forms of MalT , and that only the form recognized by MalK would be stabilized by an intra-molecular domain/domain interaction mediated by the DT3 H10/H11 motif .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Given that the T38R substitution does not change MalT affinity for maltotriose in vitro as shown here , the reduced sensitivity to MalK conferred by the substitution is not caused by an increased affinity for maltotriose but might result from an impaired interaction between MalT and MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>It might seem surprising that the MalT/MalK interaction revealed here by the affinity chromatography experiments performed with immobilized MalK responds to maltotriose or to c the malT 26 mutation , whereas this was not the case in similar experiments that were performed with immobilized MalT by Panagiotidis et al. ( 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , by performing affinity chromatography , Panagiotidis et al. ( 1998 ) provided evidence for a direct interaction between MalK and MalT , as observed with MalY but , surprisingly , the MalK Â± MalT interaction was not affected in vitro by the presence of maltotriose or by a malT c mutation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>The substitution indeed alleviates the requirement for maltotriose , i.e. renders the protein constitutively active in the presence of ADP .5 Nevertheless , the T38R MalT substitution also modifies , directly or indirectly , the DT1 determinant recognized by MalK , because it makes the DT1 / MalK interaction insensitive to the mutation malK-G346S in the DT1 context .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>We examined the effects of adding ATP , ADP , maltotriose or depleting ATP with glucose Ã¾ hexokinase or apyrase on the levels of MalK that associated with the MalT -- BCCP protein but found no signiï¬cant differences from the results shown in Fig. 1C ( data not shown ) .

<li>Either the interaction of MalK prevents the ability of MalT to-bind to MalT boxes at mal promoters or MalK may have no direct effect on DNA binding but interfere with transcriptional activation of RNA polymerase .

<li>BoÌhm et al. ( 10 ) identified a surface determinant on the C-terminal domain of MalK that is specifically involved in MalT repression and might represent the MalT binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the basis of the observation that the N637T substitution prevents MalK from interacting with MalT in vitro , we infer that the H10/H11 surface element is involved in MalK binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since MalK is known to-bind DT1 , another domain of MalT , it was possible that the H10 / 10 H11 motif is important for MalK function ( i.e. repression of MalT activity ) but not for its binding to MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , its substitution with glycine might affect MalT repression by MalK , because it disrupts the salt-bridge between helices 10 and 11 and/or because it alters the H10/H11 motif surface .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Based on in vivo observations , it was proposed that MalK and Aes also inhibit MalT by antagonizing maltotriose binding ( 3 ) : overexpression of MalT relieves repression by MalK and Aes ( 10 , 14 ) , and MalTc constitutive mutants that have a higher affinity for maltotriose than wild-type MalT are less sensitive to MalK and Aes in vivo ( 18 , 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Some MalTc variants are known to display a higher affinity for maltotriose and to be less sensitive to repression by MalK , which suggests that MalK inhibits MalT by competing with maltotriose ( 6 , 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , it is easy to imagine how interaction of MalK or another domain of MalT with the exterior cleft separating the ï¬fth and sixth helix bundles could change the curvature of the inner surface of the tunnel and preclude the binding of maltotriose , if it does bind in the tunnel , and , reciprocally , how maltotriose could prevent the H10/H11 motif from binding its target .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the lack of in vitro response to the presence of maltotriose or a malT mutation might be c caused by an alteration in the structure of the immobilized MalT protein , resulting in an unregulated presentation of the MalK-binding motif .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , since the interior of the tunnel is thought to-bind maltotriose ( O. D. , unpublished results ) , our ï¬nding might provide a simple explanation for the competition between MalK and maltotriose for MalT binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalK Antagonizes Inducer Binding by MalT -- We then tested whether , reciprocally , MalK would inhibit maltotriose binding by MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Altogether , these data strongly suggest that MalK and maltotriose compete for MalT binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>

<li>Conversely , MalK inhibits maltotriose binding by MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Based on these results , we conclude that MalK inhibits maltotriose binding by MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Characterization of the repression process revealed that MalK inhibits MalT by forming a complex with the activator and by blocking inducer binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>It also demonstrates that MalK inhibits MalT by interacting with the activator and by antagonizing inducer binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Intriguingly , the amino acid change impairs MalK binding in the full-length MalT context but not in the DT1 context .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT -- BCCP hybrid for binding to MalK and to reduce the amount of MalK recovered on the streptavidin beads .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nor did the pre-sence of the normal MalT protein result in binding of MalK to the streptavidin beads in the absence of the MalT -- BCCP hybrid .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>The malT-N637T mutation interferes with MalT inhibition by MalK in vitro To conï¬rm this interpretation , we determined whether N637T , one of the surface-exposed substitutions altering the H10/H11 surface determinant ( see Discussion ) , also relieves MalT repression by MalK in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>The substituted amino acids are either part of a surface determinant , the H10/H11 motif , playing a crucial role in MalT repression by MalK or contribute to the correct exposition of this determinant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>The retention observed is signiï¬cant because it completely disappears when afï¬nity chromatography is performed with a MalK variant ( G346S ) defective in MalT repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>The inhibitory effect observed in vitro is relieved by maltotriose and by two malT mutations and one malK mutation known to interfere with MalT repression by MalK in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that maltotriose antagonizes MalT inhibition by MalK , as was expected based on in vivo data , provides evidence that the inhibitory effect observed in vitro is physiologically relevant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MalK941 mutant protein has an increased ability to down-modulate MalT activity If MalK is somehow involved in antagonizing the ability of MalT to activate transcription at mal promoters based on the level of maltose transport into the cell , there must be a mechanism for transmitting information about transport rates to MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>The G346S substitution , which is thought to alter the MalT-binding site , specifically decreases the ability of MalK to down-regulate MalT in vivo without damaging its ability to catalyze maltose transport both when overproduced or when constitutively ex-4 pressed from a chromosomal locus ( 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>The structural consequences of ATP hydrolysis might be different , however , in the context of the assembled transporter , and conformational changes of the MalK regulatory region might accompany the ATP hydrolysis cycle when coupled to transport and thus control the ability of MalK to interact with MalT .

<li>The search , which was performed under conditions in which MalT activity was repressed by MalK , led to the identiï¬cation of a surface region on DT3 that is involved speciï¬cally in the control of MalT activity by MalK .

<li>Discussion The search for gain of function mutations in DT3 under conditions of MalT inhibition by MalK revealed a surface-exposed determinant that is involved speciï¬cally in MalT control by MalK .

<li>The data presented in this paper dealing with one of these MalK-insensitive mutations no longer give evidence for a mediator of MalK in its function of inhibiting MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>The regulatory domain of MalK also interacts with MalT , inhibiting its activity as a transcriptional-activator ( 31 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16321936" target="_blank">16321936</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results presented here do not provide any information about how the MalK subunit antagonizes the activity of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>The observation of sequences that are homologous in the three proteins MalK , MalT , and MalI would speak for a common sugar recognition site in these proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2670898" target="_blank">2670898</a>]<br></li>
<li>The lack of any effect of nucleotides on the ability of MalK to interact with MalT may be due to differences in the MalK protein when it is separated from the MalF and MalG integral membrane proteins or an inability to completely deplete or exchange nucleotides in crude extracts .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>The in vivo and in vitro assays described here should permit the identiï¬cation and characterization of mutant forms of the MalT and MalK proteins that are defective in their ability to interact .

<li>Results MalT and MalK interact in vivo We constructed a hybrid form of MalT , MalT -- BCCP , that contains the biotination signals from the BCCP protein ( Cronan , 1990 ) attached to the C-terminus of MalT ( see Fig. 1A ) to test the hypothesis that MalK antagonizes the transcriptional activity of MalT via a direct physical interaction .

<li>No detectable MalK was bound to the streptavidin beads in the presence of the normal MalT protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although these data do not permit quantiï¬cation of the relative amounts of MalK and MalT -- BCCP bound to the streptavidin beads , they are consistent with a speciï¬c interaction between MalK and the MalT -- BCCP protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>As can be seen in Fig. 4A , the amounts of MalK protein bound to the streptavidin beads are indistinguishable whether the MalT -- BCCP or the Mal-T1 ( Con ) -- BCCP are present on the beads .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>To examine the ability of the GST -- MalT protein to-bind to the MalK protein , glu-tathione-agarose beads were loaded with GST -- MalT protein and the beads were incubated with extracts containing the MalK protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>To examine the ability of the His-6 -- MalK protein to interact with the MalT -- BCCP protein , extracts containing each protein were incubated together and then streptavidin-agarose beads were added to capture MalT -- BCCP and any interacting proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data are consistent with the hypothesis that both the MalT -- BCCP and the normal MalT proteins bind to the MalK protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conclude that MalK can speciï¬cally interact with both the MalT protein and the two hybrid MalT proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conclude that the MalK protein can directly interact with the MalT and MalT -- BCCP proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>If the interaction between MalK and the MalT -- BCCP hybrid is speciï¬c , extracts containing normal MalT protein would be expected to compete with the Fig. 1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the BCCP protein is present in the sample , results presented above ruled out the role of the BCCP portion of the MalT -- BCCP hybrid in mediating its interaction with the MalK protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this report we describe the use of tagged versions of MalT to provide evidence that it physically interacts with the MalK protein both in vitro and in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Before using this protein as a tool to study the ability of MalK and MalT to interact in vitro , we ï¬rst examined its ability to function in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Even though we do not yet know the basis of the dominant phenotype , we reasoned that if MalK and MalT interact in vivo , excess MalK might titrate the MalT -- BCCP protein and reverse its dominant negative effect independently of the mechanism of the dominance .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , in order to measure the ability of MalK to reverse the dominant negative effect of the MalT -- BCCP protein , we used a strain that contains the malT1 ( Con ) mutation and a malP -- lacZ Ã¾ transcriptional fusion .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data provide compelling evidence that MalT physically interacts with MalK , that the interaction is functionally relevant , and that maltotri-ose prevents formation of the MalT-MalK complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>To ï¬nd out whether MalK and MalT form a binary complex or whether additional proteins participate in this interaction , we constructed the same His-6 -- MalK hybrid described by Davidson ( Davidson and Sharma , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>As a result , the ability of MalT to interact with MalK was possibly unregulated , and the secondary structural motifs involved in MalK recognition were permanently exposed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mutant forms of MalT and MalK are defective in signalling but retain the ability to interact As previously reported and shown here , the MalT1 ( Con ) mutant form of MalT is not antagonized by MalK ( Reyes and Shuman , 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , a search for transposon-induced mutants of E. coli in which MalK can not repress mal transcription did not yield candidate genes for a third putative factor required for the MalK -- MalT interaction ( K. Decker and W. Boos , unpublished results ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , we show that a novel malK mutation , malK941 , results in an increased ability of MalK to down-modulate MalT activity in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , cells with high levels of MalK ATPase show a reduced ability to down-mod-ulate MalT and express several mal genes constitutively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this report we show that the MalK and MalT proteins physically interact and that the levels of FGK2 ATPase control the ability of MalK to inï¬uence MalT-dependent transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>We do not know if the afï¬nity of the interaction between MalT and MalK is the same as that between MalT1 ( Con ) -- BCCP and MalK , but given the results in Fig. 4A , it seems unlikely that the nearly complete resistance of malT1 ( Con ) strains to antagonism by MalK can be explained by an inability of the two proteins to interact .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results are consistent with the hypothesis that MalK and MalT functionally interact in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT and MalK physically interact in vitro Even though the results obtained in vivo are consistent with a functional interaction between MalK and MalT , they do not demonstrate a direct physical interaction between the two proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our test system should easily have detected even a slight interference by these MalT fragments as a relief from MalKmediated repression , since repression due to only basal levels of chromosomally encoded MalK was not saturating ( Tables 2 and 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , full-length MalT-T38R does not bind MalK ( Fig. 3C ) ; the effect of the T38R substitution on the interaction between MalK and full-length MalT must therefore be indirect and probably involves a conformational effect .

<li>Puriï¬ed MalT protein was chromatographed on a Ni-NTA column preloaded with His-tagged MalK , and after extensive washing , MalK was eluted with imidazole .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>

<li>To gain insight into the mechanism whereby MalK modulates MalT activity , we developed an in vitro system that reproduces MalT inhibition by MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>

<li>Since no relief of repression was observed even with the longest fragment , the site of MalK interaction in MalT must differ from the MalY-MalT interaction site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is consistent with the conclusion that MalK and MalY interaction sites with MalT are not identical .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>This shows not only that MalK acts as a repressor but also that MalT is activated by internal sources .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>

<li>Because ATP is a ligand for both MalK and MalT , it would be surprising if purine nucleotides did not inï¬uence the MalK -- MalT interaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>There are several indications that it is the state of transport activity which controls the interaction of MalK with MalT and thus the activity of the latter ( 2 , 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16321936" target="_blank">16321936</a>]<br></li>

<li>A second possibility is that MalK , as long as it is not engaged in transport , interacts with MalT and inactivates it .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Approximately equivalent amounts of His-6 -- MalK and MalT -- BCCP are seen in the ï¬rst lane .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under these conditions , MalK is tightly associated with the MalFG complex and has no afï¬nity for MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is formally possible , however , that a third mole-cule , undetactable by Coomassie blue stain , bridges the MalK and MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>What is the function of the H10/H11 surface motif in MalT inhibition by MalK ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>It should be stressed that there is no compelling evidence that MalK actually dissociates from MalFG during MalT inhibition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this latter region , 4 amino acids of MalK were identical to those of MalT , and the homology , taking conservative exchanges into account , was 54 % .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2670898" target="_blank">2670898</a>]<br></li>
<li>Identical amino acids in the region 161 to 190 of MalK and the region 751 to 780 of MalT are indicated by boldface letters in the MalT sequence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2670898" target="_blank">2670898</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of substrate to be transported , MalK would be free to interact with MalT and cause repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to a malK strain , the MalK-LacZ activity of BRE1219 ( malK ) is low due to the inhibition of MalT by chromosomal levels of MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , our attempts to observe interference of the Nterminal fragments of MalT with MalK-mediated repression failed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this scenario , MalK engaged in transport would relieve MalT from inhibition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16321936" target="_blank">16321936</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , all of the substitutions alleviate MalT inhibition by MalK partially or entirely .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the mechanism of MalT inhibition by MalK remains unclear .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Comparison of the responses to increasing concentrations of MalY indicates that the T38R substitution actually slightly increases MalT susceptibility to inhibition by MalY , as observed in vivo ( 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>This therefore demonstrates that the inhibitory effect observed in vitro reflects the phenomenon of MalT repression by Aes observed in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>The reduced sensitivity to MalY action displayed by the MalT 26 C variant provides evidence that the repressive effect analysed in vitro faithfully mimics the repression phenom-enon observed in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , the inhibiting effect of MalY can still be observed in mlc mutants that have elevated levels of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>To ensure that the inhibitory effect observed in vitro was functionally relevant , we verified that a MalT variant was not inhibited by MalY in C our in vitro system .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test this hypothesis , we purified the T38R MalT variant and analyzed its sensitivity to both inhibitory proteins in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>

<li>Aes-mediated repression of malK-lacZ is counteracted by increasing MalT b-Galactose activity ( U/mg of protein ) b Relevant genotypea Plasmid ( s ) Uninduced IPTG induced TABLE 5 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9401025" target="_blank">9401025</a>]<br></li>
<li>To obtain a better understanding of how the activity of MalT is negatively modulated , we have analyzed in vitro the mechanism whereby the Aes protein inhibits MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>None of the hybrid proteins displayed MalT activity as expected from the finding that deletions affecting the C-terminus of MalT lead to inactivation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3015733" target="_blank">3015733</a>]<br></li>
<li>This conclusion is consistent with the observation that MalY does not stimulate the intrinsic ATPase activity of MalT ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Table 1 , MalT overproduction strongly enhances-the-activity of malEpD92 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>DISCUSSION The in vitro analysis reported here establishes that negative control of MalT activity by Aes is direct .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , in vivo , the substitutions scarcely affect MalT activity in a no-repression context as well as MalT response to MalY or , in the four cases tested , to Aes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the activity of the malK-lacZ fusion is low in ME429 due to MalY-MalT interaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>The mechanism by which MalT activity is negatively controlled is best understood in the case of MalY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , Aes seems to down-regulate MalT activity via the same mechanism as MalY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Using a biochemical approach , we analyse here the mechan-ism whereby MalY represses MalT activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>We then asked whether the up mutations also relieve MalT inhibition by MalY and by Aes , two other negative effectors of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , similar in vitro repression assays performed with Aes and MalY conï¬rmed that the MalT-N637T substitution does not alter MalT response to the other two negative effectors ( Figure 3 ( b ) and ( c ) ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , little is known regarding the raison d' eÌtre of the negative controls exerted by MalY and Aes on MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>The interaction of MalT with two other enzymes , MalY and Aes , can lead to its inactivation ( Boos & Bohm , 2000 ; Schlegel et al. , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16451192" target="_blank">16451192</a>]<br></li>
<li>The T38R Substitution in MalT Specifically Prevents Aes Binding -- The above-mentioned results point toward identical mechanisms for MalT inhibition by MalY and Aes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since MalY also recognizes determinants in DT1 and -2 , the interaction sites in MalT for MalY and Aes may overlap but can not be identical .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>

<li>In order to ï¬nd out more about the interaction of MalT with its three repressors MalK , MalY , and Aes , we analyzed whether mutations in MalT leading to elevated mal gene expression have different sensitivities towards the three repressors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Biochemical analyses of the mechanisms whereby MalK and Aes prevent MalT from activating the mal promoters should clarify the question of whether both repressors act like MalY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>An interesting finding of this work is that MalK inhibits MalT via the same mechanism as MalY and Aes ( 19 , 20 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is our working hypothesis that both MalY and Aes act in the same way as MalK by interacting with MalT to shift the equilibrium to its inactive state .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalK Interacts with DT1 -- The similarity between the action modes of the three negative effectors of MalT suggests that , like MalY and Aes , MalK might interact with DT1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since MalT is known to interact not only with MalK but also with MalY and Aes , we tested in vivo the sensitivity of these mutant MalT proteins towards the three repressor proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , MalT activity is negatively regulated by three different proteins , MalK ( the ATP-binding component of the maltose transporter ) , MalY , and Aes via an unknown mechanism ( 1 , 6 -- 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalK , the ATP-hydrolyzing subunit of the cognate ABC transporter , MalY , an enzyme with the activity of a cystathionase , and Aes , an acetyl esterase , phenotypically act as repressors of MalT activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , as revealed by the MalT activity assays , a high concentration of maltotriose fully relieves MalT inhibition by MalK ( Fig. 1A ) , MalY , or Aes , thereby suggesting a phenomenon of competitive inhibition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the N637T substitution , which alters a surface-exposed residue , does not affect MalT activity in vitro , or its sensitivity to the inhibition by MalY or Aes , but fully prevents MalT inhibition by MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Effect of the MalTN637T substitution on the inhibition of MalT activity by MalK , Aes and MalY , in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , MalK , the ABC component of the maltodextrin transport system , and the two enzymes MalY and Aes down-regulate MalT activity in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to MalK , two other proteins , namely MalY , a C-S lyase , and Aes , an acyl esterase , down-regulate MalT activity ( 17 , 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , although we can not exclude the possibility that the DT1-DT2 linker might be part of the MalK , MalY , and Aes binding sites , we favor the idea that the malTc26 mutation makes MalT insensitive to the repressor proteins simply by stabilizing the active form of MalT , i.e. via a long range effect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , the model according to which MalY would stabilize the inactive form of MalT applies equally to Aes , but it is presently unclear whether the molecular details of the inhibitory reactions are the same .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Given that the three inhibitory proteins are unrelated at the sequence level and that MalK and MalY do not share any obvious structural similarity ( 29 , 32 ) , the molecular details of the interaction between the inactive form of MalT and each of the negative effectors is likely to be different .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>SDS Â± PAGE analysis and Coomassie blue staining of the gel revealed that a significant amount of MalT bound to the MalY Â± agarose column and was recovered in the 2 M KCl eluate ( Fig. 3A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that the competition between the inhibitory protein and the inducer is similarly influenced by the nucleotide bound to MalT strongly suggests that MalY and Aes interact with the same conformational MalT species .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previous work had revealed that competition between the inducer and MalY is affected by the nucleotide bound to MalT ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , we investigated whether the nucleotide bound to MalT also affects the competition between Aes and the inducer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the nucle-otide bound to MalT similarly affects competition between the inducer and MalY or Aes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT and Aes Form a Complex -- To test the hypothesis that MalT inhibition by Aes involves a direct protein-protein interaction , we tried to isolate a MalT-Aes complex by gel filtration .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT interacts directly with MalY To test the hypothesis that repression by MalY involves formation of a MalT Â± MalY complex , we examined whether immobilized MalY protein would bind the activator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Complex formation was hitherto observed with samples containing 2.1 mM MalY dimer and 4.6 mM MalT , i.e. 0.9 MalY polypeptide/one MalT polypeptide , and no additional peak was observed except for some trailing of the MalT protein , which suggested that MalY and MalT might be present in the complex in a 1:1 ( protomer : protomer ) ratio .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , analyses of samples containing various concentrations of MalY and MalT , the two proteins present in a 1:1 ( protomer : protomer ) ratio , revealed that the apparent molecular weight of the complex varied with the concentrations of MalY and MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vivo studies have revealed that MalT action is negatively controlled by the MalY protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>To seek insight into how MalT action is negatively regulated , we used a biochemical approach and chose , as a model , the MalY protein whose structure is known .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Altogether , these data strongly suggest that MalT binding to the MalY column is the result of a specific interaction between MalT and MalY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Controls showed that BSA did not bind to the MalY Â± agarose column , nor did MalT bind to the column matrix ( data not shown ; Fig. 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , we showed that MalY also binds the unliganded form of MalT ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our data also demonstrate that MalY action upon MalT does not require any additional factor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>This DT1H-MalY interaction is speciï¬c since no complex could be observed when DT1H was replaced by DT3 , another domain of MalT , at the same molar concentration ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the spatial location of the putative MalTbinding patches in the MalY dimer are consistent with a heterotetrameric complex ( MalT Â± MalY Â± MalY Â± MalT ) ( T. Clausen et al. , unpublished ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>This argues against the possibility that the MalY Â± MalT complex contains one protomer of each protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>In order to characterize the MalT Â± MalY complex , we isolated it by filtration through a molecular sieve .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Isolation of the MalT Â± MalY complex Fig. 4 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>What is the stoichiometry of the MalY Â± MalT complex ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>It should be noted that , because protection shows a steep dependence upon MalT concentration ( Raibaud et al. , 1989 ) , a 4-fold effect of maltotriose or ATP on the affinity of MalT for the promoter DNA could account for the absence of protection observed when one effector was omitted .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whereas MalT is mostly monomeric in the absence of maltotriose ( Schreiber and Richet , 1999 ) , MalY is a dimer whose subunits are held together by numerous salt bridges and hydrogen bonds , as well as extensive hydrophobic interactions ( T. Clausen et al. , unpublished ) , and it is therefore extremely unlikely that the protein monomerizes upon binding MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Point mutations in malT ( malTc ) have been isolated that confer a constitutive expression of the maltose regulon when maltodextrin is not present in the growth medium ( 12 , 13 ) The in vitro analysis of two corresponding MalTc proteins revealed that , in contrast to the wild-type MalT , they could activate transcription from a MalT-depen-dent promoter in the absence of maltotriose but could still be * Corresponding author .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Even though in vivo , the maltose system is induced by all maltodextrins in the medium serving as a carbon source , in vitro , MalT is activated only to stimulate malP transcription by maltotriose ( 49 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16321936" target="_blank">16321936</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although all of the maltodextrins , including maltose , induce the expression of the regulon in vivo , in vitro studies have revealed that the only maltodextrin able to activate purified MalT protein is maltotriose ( 25 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>
<li>It binds maltotriose , the only maltodextrin able to act as a positive effector of MalT for activation of transcription in vitro ( Raibaud and Richet , 1987 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Complex mechanisms regulate the expression of this operon ; expression is activated by MalT , which binds to the malEFG promoter in its maltotriose-bound form and by the cAMP receptor protein , which binds in its cAMP bound form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11350954" target="_blank">11350954</a>]<br></li>
<li>In glucose minimal medium , there is neither activation of the promoter by MalT because of a lack of maltotriose nor activation by cAMP receptor protein because of a lack of cAMP ( 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11350954" target="_blank">11350954</a>]<br></li>
<li>In nutrient broth maltotriose is present , so MalT activates malE expression even though the cAMP receptor protein is not active ( 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11350954" target="_blank">11350954</a>]<br></li>
<li>This mutant produced a MalT protein that did not need exogenous maltose for activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2423504" target="_blank">2423504</a>]<br></li>
<li>Effect of maltose , maltotriose , and maltotetraose on activation of transcription from malPp by the MalT protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3298211" target="_blank">3298211</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT protein requires intracellular maltotriose for activation of transcription ( Rarbaud arid Richet , 1987 ) and growth-on-maltose or other maltosaccharides is the classical means of eliciting mal gene induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7651130" target="_blank">7651130</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , when cells are grown on maltose , this sugar has to be converted to maltotriose or another as yet unknown internal inducer for the activation of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2670898" target="_blank">2670898</a>]<br></li>
<li>This constitutivity is attributed to an altered MalT protein , which either no longer requires internal inducer for activation or has an increased affinity for the internal inducer , be it maltotriose or an as yet unidentified polysaccharide .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2670898" target="_blank">2670898</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alternatively , they may have a MalT protein with increased affinity for internal maltotriose or with decreased specificity , so that it can recognize the longer maltodextrins expected to derive from the degradation of endogenous glycogen .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3298211" target="_blank">3298211</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vitro , a constitutive MalT variant ( which is partially active in the absence of maltotriose ) is less sensitive than wild-type MalT to repression by MalY , as observed in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Compared with what is observed with wild-type MalT , the MalT 26 mutation simply decreases the C maltotriose concentration required to relieve repression by MalY , which , together with the fact that MalT 26 has a C higher affinity for the inducer , further supports the hypothesized competition between maltotriose and MalY .

<li>This article must therefore be hereby capable of acting as exogenous inducers , only maltotriose is marked `` aduertisement '' in accordance with 18 U.S.C.

<li>Since they are not degraded inside the cells and since MalT in vitro is activated only by maltotriose ( 48 ) , the induction seen under these conditions must be due to the transport of these sugars per se .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16321936" target="_blank">16321936</a>]<br></li>
<li>The explanation for this phenomenon is that maltotetraose and maltotriose which are released from phosphorylase-limited glycogen by GlgX , the debranching enzyme , are no longer repolymerized by the missing MalQ activity and result in the activation of MalT by the endogenously accumulating inducer maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21421758" target="_blank">21421758</a>]<br></li>
<li>The mutations of the mutants isolated and characterized in this work eliminate the dependence of MalT upon one of its ligands , maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>
<li>The only maltodextrin known to activate MalT is maltotriose ( 44 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2670898" target="_blank">2670898</a>]<br></li>
<li>The only inducer established so far to be able to activate MalT in vitro is maltotriose ( 202 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>The effect of MalY on MalT activity was investigated in the presence of various concentrations of maltotriose , as the inducer might interfere with repression by MalY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>

<li>MalT activity is controlled by two regulatory circuits : a positive one with maltotriose as effector and a negative one involving several proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>To investigate the possibility that the ATPase activity observed in the absence of maltotriose was due to a contaminating enzyme , we further purified MalT by anion-exchange chromatography .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT has an ATPase activity stimulated by maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>This ATPase activity was stimulated 2 - to 3-fold by maltotriose , strongly suggesting that this activity was indeed intrinsic to MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , similar curved homopolymers were observed when MalT was incubated with maltotriose and ADP ( Figure 1B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vitro transcription experiments with purified MalT have shown that , of all dextrins tested , only maltotriose is effective in stimulating the action of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1856179" target="_blank">1856179</a>]<br></li>
<li>To distinguish between these possibilities , we tested whether the apparent affinity of MalT for maltotriose varied according to the nucleotide ligand .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>

<li>These conclusions are supported by the following observations : ( i ) Aes inhibits MalT in a purified transcription system , ( ii ) Aes and MalT form a complex stable enough to be isolated by gel filtration , ( iii ) Aes inhibits malto-triose binding by MalT , and ( iv ) reciprocally , maltotriose inhib-its Aes binding to MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>These conclusions are based on the following observations : ( i ) MalY inhibits transcription activation by MalT in a purified transcription system ; ( ii ) MalY forms a complex with MalT that is stable enough to be isolated by gel filtration ; and ( iii ) maltotriose and MalY compete for MalT binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both nucleotides allow MalT inhibition by MalY and Aes in vitro , but they clearly differentially affect the equilibrium between inactive complexes ( MalT-Aes or MalT-MalY ) and active MalT-maltotriose complexes , with ADP favoring the interaction with the inhibitory protein ( Fig. 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT inhibition by MalY and Aes is observed for similar concentrations of inhibitory proteins and is counteracted by the same concentrations of maltotriose ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the inhibition by MalY observed when maltotriose was omitted from the reaction mixture ( Fig. 2 ) demonstrates that a MalT variant , such C as MalT 26 , has not completely lost the ability to respond C to MalY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>These gel filtration data suggested that the nucleotide bound to MalT influences the relative affinities of MalT for MalY and maltotriose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>The competition between MalY and maltotriose is influenced by the nucleotide bound to MalT We next investigated whether the ability of MalY to form a complex with MalT depends on the nucleotide bound to MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ADP Â± MalT form was also inhibited by MalY but , interestingly , the action of the repressor was not antagonized by up to 100 mM maltotriose ( Fig. 7B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>All these data therefore indicate that MalTc26 is still intrinsically sensitive to Aes and that one effect of malTc26 is to decrease the concentration of maltotriose required to relieve MalT repression by Aes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data clearly demonstrate that maltotriose inhibits interaction between MalT and Aes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , this work demonstrates that Aes is a negative effector of MalT that competes with maltotriose , as previously hypothesized on the basis of in vivo data ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>One intriguing feature of MalT is the complex interplay between ATP or ADP binding and the binding of the inducer and the negative effectors , MalY and Aes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Together , these results establish that MalY acts directly upon MalT without the help of any factor , and that MalY is a negative effector of MalT competing with the inducer for MalT binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like MalY , Aes is a negative effector of MalT that interferes with malto-triose binding ( N. Joly and E. Richet , personal communication ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , we show that MalY interacts physically with MalT and inhibits the activator by preventing the binding of maltotriose , one of its positive effectors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalY is a negative effector of MalT that competes with maltotriose binding , thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Aes Inhibits Maltotriose Binding by MalT -- Having observed that maltotriose antagonizes Aes binding by MalT , we tested whether , inversely , Aes inhibits maltotriose binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>

<li>Moreover , the observation that a high concentration of maltotriose relieves repression by MalY supports the model in which MalY and maltotriose compete for MalT binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Together with the observation that maltotriose impedes MalY binding by MalT , these data provide compelling evidence that MalY and maltotriose compete for MalT binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>

<li>Together with the ability of maltotriose to prevent Aes binding by MalT , these data conclusively demonstrate that , like MalY , Aes competes with the inducer for MalT binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent studies have revealed that both MalY and Aes interact directly with MalT and compete with maltotriose for MalT binding ( 19 , 20 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>We demonstrate that MalY forms a complex with MalT only in the absence of maltotriose and that , conversely , MalY inhibits maltotriose binding by MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalY inhibits maltotriose binding by MalT Having demonstrated that the inducer prevents MalT from interacting with MalY , we asked whether , reciprocally , MalY inhibited maltotriose binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>As MalT variants display a c higher affinity for maltotriose ( Dardonville and Raibaud , 1990 ) , it has been proposed that MalK , MalY and Aes inhibit MalT by competing with maltotriose for the binding of the activator ( Boos and Shuman , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>The inactive form is stabilized by MalK , MalY or Aes , whereas the active form is stabilized by maltotriose , which thus competes with the negative effectors for binding to MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalK , another negative effector of MalT ( 10 ) , is also thought to prevent maltotriose binding like MalY and Aes ( 3 ) , but thus far , we do not know where its binding site is located on MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>All of these features indicate that MalK inhibits MalT by the same mechanism as two other proteins , MalY and Aes , that also act as negative effectors of MalT by antagonizing maltotriose binding by MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Maltotriose , the inducer , promotes MalT self-association , a critical step in promoter binding , whereas three proteins acting as negative allosteric-effectors ( MalK , the ABC-component of the maltodextrin transporter , MalY , and Aes ) antagon-ize maltotriose binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>One 6 distinctive feature of MalT is the multiplicity of regulatory signals that modulate MalT selfassociation : MalT multimerization is stimulated by maltotriose , the inducer , and inhibited by three 7 proteins , Aes , MalK and MalY , which act as negative allosteric-effectors .

<li>The stronger effect of mutations in sites 1 , 2 , and 3 under noninducing conditions may be due either to the lower concentration of active MalT molecules or to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cAMP resulting from the absence of maltose in the growth medium .

<li>The observed severe decrease in malEFG and malKlamB malM transcription as well as LamB levels in hns and hns-stpA mutant strains was most likely caused by the combined and additive effects of the lower levels of both MalT and CRP which characterized these strains ( this work and unpublished data ) .

<li>The level of b-galactosidase observed with wild-type MalT when repressed by Aes corresponded to 4 % of the unrepressed level ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>The b-galactosidase levels ranged from 0.7 to 1.4 times that obtained with wild-type MalT , which contrasts with the 5 -- 14 times stimulatory effect observed in the presence of MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>The presence of MalT-BCCP is negatively dominant over wild-type MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>The dotted line represents the sum of the profiles obtained when MalT and MalY were filtered separately .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>The level of activity observed with wildC type MalT in the presence of MalY was 17 % of the unrepressed level under these conditions Figure 1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>The T38R substitution does not alter the specific activity of MalT ( in the presence of a saturating concentration of nucleoside triphosphate ) , nor does it suppress its ability to interact with MalY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>The effect of the DT3 up mutations on MalT repression by MalY was assessed by measuring the levels of b-galactosidase made by an isogenic DmalT DmalK malITTn10 strain ( pop7192 ) carrying pOM181 or derivatives thereof .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>The model proposed is consistent with the observations that mutation malTc26 renders MalT insensitive to repression by FIG. 5 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>The clustering of these mutations favors a mechanism of proteinprotein interaction with MalT as causing repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>malT ( Con ) mutants , which also express the system constitutively ( 3 ) , were class-ically considered to produce a MalT protein able to activate transcription in the absence of inducer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3298211" target="_blank">3298211</a>]<br></li>
<li>For instance , all of them show very little effect in malT ( Con ) strains where the induction of the mal system becomes independent of inducer or under conditions where the level of MalT is increased .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9401025" target="_blank">9401025</a>]<br></li>
<li>For a fixed concentration of RNA polymerase , this rate depends on the concentration of MalT , thereby providing an assay for MalT activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>For this purpose , we determined the concentration of MalT in the peak fraction by quantification on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and tested MalT activity by using the malPp abortive initiation assay ( 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since some of the mutations reduced the affinity of MalT for the non-mutated sites ( see above ) , it was interesting to measure the activity of the maIPp variants under conditions in which MalT was 15 times more abundant ( pre-sence of malTp7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the activity of malEpD92 is limited by the concentration of active MalT forms under these conditions , one can identify gain of function mutations in malT by looking for red colonies on MacConkey lactose plates .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>To characterize further MalT self-associated species formed in solution , we used cryo-electron microscopy of frozen-hydrated samples and image processing .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>It will be interesting , therefore , to ï¬nd out whether these proteins self-associate in the same way as MalT and how such multimerization serves the function of the PknK kinase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>malEp 92 is a truncated variant of the malEp promoter whose full activation requires a higher concentration of MalT than does malEp ( 33 ) and which is expected to respond to any increase in the concentration of active MalT in an unrepressed context ( i.e. , free of MalK ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>With regard to the speciï¬c role played by CRP bound to site 1 , it is unlikely that the protein acts by preventing an aggregation phenomenon since its stimulatory effect does not increase with the concentration of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>It could be that producing 15 times more MalT polypeptides does not necessarily result in a 15-fold increase in the concentration of active MalT molecules in the cell , and that , even under these conditions , MalT site 1 could still be incompletely occupied .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>Note also that , for a given concentration of MalT , the fraction of the protein that is in the active form , as judged by the promoter response , depends on the concentrations of the positive effectors and on the MalT variant assayed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is true under all of the conditions that we have tested : low concentration of active MalT protein ( growth in the absence of maltose ) , moderate MalT concentration ( growth in the presence of maltose ) and high MaiT concentration ( growth in the presence of maltose of a strain overproducing MalT ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>Statistically this would result in significant variations of the concentration of MalT protein in individual cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=6325162" target="_blank">6325162</a>]<br></li>
<li>( Note that such an increase does not necessarily result in an equivalent increase in the concentration of active MalT ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>A further increase in the intracellular concentration of active MalT protein appeared to be slightly inhibitory ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>A high inducer concentration ( or the malT ( Con ) mutation ) is more effective than an increase in the concentration of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>Raising the concentration of MalT caused the appearance of a discrete 220-kDa peak with increasing magnitude .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>For a purified MalT preparation , a concentration of 1 mg/ml corresponded to 8 , uM MalT monomers ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>
<li>Clearly , the repression of malE expression by CreBC is dominant to activation by MalT , because constitutive activation of CreBC ( i.e. the creC3 allele ) leads to a reduction of malE expression during growth in nutrient broth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11350954" target="_blank">11350954</a>]<br></li>
<li>This does not rule out the possibility that Mlc may also control individual mal genes directly , which is difï¬cult to test as malE or malK can not be expressed in the absence of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484893" target="_blank">9484893</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , malZ is also induced at high osmolarity independent of MalT 251 ( 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21421758" target="_blank">21421758</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recently , we found that malZ expression can also occur in the absence of MalT , in particular under conditions of high medium osmolarity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT formed intracelullar aggregates under most growth conditions ( M63B1 , rich medium at 37 C ) but remained soluble when the cells were grown in rich medium at 25 ` C .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>This discrepancy between data obtained with conditions known to shift MalTJMalT , equilibrium towards MalT , indicates that the increase in MalT , conversion would not be the only effect of some of these mutations or induced conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>Induced conditions and malT ' , malQ or malK mutations have all been shown to shift the MalT , / MalT , equilibrium towards MalT , .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , molecular mechanisms to shift MalT , / MalT , equilibrium towards MalT , .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>Filtration of a sample containing both MalT and Aes gave two peaks at the positions at which MalT and Aes , respectively , elute when chromatographed alone .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also , overproduction of MalT counteracted the Aes-dependent repression , indicating a direct interaction between MalT and Aes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9401025" target="_blank">9401025</a>]<br></li>
<li>This demonstrates that the degree of repression is dependent on the concentration of Aes and that it can be counteracted by increasing the level of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9401025" target="_blank">9401025</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , Aes and MalT do form a complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>This ensures that MalT inhibition by Aes , if any , would be detected .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Repression by Aes is counteracted by elevated levels of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9401025" target="_blank">9401025</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , an increase in the level of MalT counteracts the effect of Aes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9401025" target="_blank">9401025</a>]<br></li>
<li>Of the three positive regulators , Crp , MalT , and Lrp , the effect of Lrp is by far the weakest and may not be direct .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7751276" target="_blank">7751276</a>]<br></li>
<li>Yet , for its activation , MalT needs to-bind inducer ( 49 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16321936" target="_blank">16321936</a>]<br></li>
<li>This , in turn , will release MalT , allowing its activation by inducer , and will lead to transcriptional activity ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>A model for the interplay between the inducer and the negative effectors of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>

<li>This includes DnaA , FarR , GlpR , MalT , Lrp , MetR , NarL , TyrR , TorR and TreR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9813115" target="_blank">9813115</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT therefore specifically binds the adenine nucleoside triphosphates , with no distinction being made between the ribo - and the deoxyribo-forms .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>, 1984 ; Weber & Steitz , 1984 ) and , as discussed above , MalT probably also contacts the MalT box through the major groove .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under the conditions used , ADP Â± MalT would then have .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , GerE Bsu is only 74 residues in length while MalT Eco is 901 residues long .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7699720" target="_blank">7699720</a>]<br></li>
<li>Other nucleotides were examined for their ability to activate MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , eigenvector 2 is most likely related to a variation in the size of the MalT homopolymers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>

<li>In conclusion , we propose that the eight amino acid substitutions result in the same discrete and well-defined change in MalT conformation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>

<li>Consideration of all of the data obtained in the presence of maltotriose alone and in the presence of maltotriose 1 AMP-PNP , however , suggests the following association pathway : monomer 3 dimer 3 ( MalT ) n 3 unlimited aggregates , where ( MalT ) n would be a discrete size multimer , possibly a tetramer or a hexamer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that ATP gave an intermediate response close to that obtained with AMP-PNP ( a 10-fold higher concentration of maltotriose was required to antagonize MalY action in the presence of ATP compared with that observed in the presence of AMP-PNP ) might reflect the presence of both ATP-bound and ADP-bound forms resulting from ATP hydrolysis by MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of maltotriose 1 ATP , the degree of association of MalT is intermediate between that observed in the presence of maltotriose 1 AMP-PNP and that observed in the presence of maltotriose 1 ADP ; this is best explained by the presence of both ATP - and ADP-bound forms due to ATP hydrolysis by the protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>The intermediate results obtained with ATP are best explained by the presence of both ATP - and ADP-bound forms of MalT due to ATP hydrolysis during the assay .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>2 AMP-PNP , which can replace ATP as an effector of MalT ( 33 ) , is actually more effective than ATP in driving MalT self-association in the presence of maltotriose due to the absence of ATP hydrolysis , which generates ADP-bound forms that are less prone to multimerization ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT activity in the presence of ATP , AMP-PNP or ADP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Gel filtration and sedimentation experiments were used to analyze the quaternary structure of MalT in solution in the absence or presence of maltotriose and/or AMP-PNP , ATP , or ADP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , we infer that , at least up to this step , ATP merely acts as an allosteric effector , i.e. that neither the potential energy of ATP hydrolysis nor the phosphorylation of MalT or maltotriose are needed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The event that would cause ATP hydrolysis and the MalT form that undergoes ATP hydrolysis are both unknown .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Does ATP hydrolysis occur at one step of the activation process , as suggested by the ability of MalT to hydrolyse ATP ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>ATP Â± MalT is more effective than ADP Â± MalT in oligomerizing and promoting transcription-activation , which indicates that ATP/maltotriose/MalT is the species responsible for the transcriptional-activity and that ATP hydrolysis might be coupled to the disassembly of oligomeric structures ( Schreiber and Richet , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Role of ATP in activation of transcription initiation by MalT The main conclusion of this work is that activation of transcription initiation by MalT requires , in addition to maltotriose , the presence of ATP ( or dATP ) as an effector of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>ATP and AMP-PNP , a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP , are equally effective in promoting activation of transcription by MalT in the presence of maltotriose ( 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Altogether these results establish that ATP is required as a positive effector of MalT in the process of transcription-activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The finding that ATP is involved in transcription-activation by MalT raises several questions about its role .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription activation by MalT 1 involves MalT self-association , cooperative bind-2 ing to copies of the MalT recognition motif that are present in target promoters , and stimulation of 3 -- 5 open complex formation by RNA polymerase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription activation by 1,2 MalT involves MalT self-association , cooperative 3 binding to several copies of a 10 bp asymmetric recognition motif ( 5 0-ggGGa ( T/G ) GAgg-30 ) that are located in the target promoters , and stimulation 4 -- 6 of open complex formation by RNA polymerase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription activation by MalT involves MalT self-association , cooperative binding to an array of MalT sites located in the target promoters , and stimulation of open complex formation by the RNA polymerase ( 14 -- 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Given that the ATPase activity of MalT does not play any role in the activation of open complex formation ( 5 ) , it is tempting to propose that it actually plays a role in the negative control of MalT activity and that the MalT/ADP form is the actual target of MalY and Aes in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT binding to DNA shows the same specificity for maltodextrins and nucleotides as MalT activation of open complex formation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT displays weak ATPase activity whose function remains elusive : protein self-association , promo-ter binding and open complex formation do not require ATP hydrolysis ( Richet and Raibaud , 1989 ; Schreiber and Richet , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>A +1 5 ' - A T A A C G T T 3 ' - T A T T G C A A ApA + p p * pC -- ApA * pC z 50B 30 Â° 20 ) 10 ATP is required for activation of open complex formation by MalT Using the abortive initiation assay described above , we examined the effect of ATP on open complex formation in the presence of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>The conclusion that ATP hydrolysis is not needed at least up to formation of the open complex is further strengthened by the observation that the MalT-ADP form was fully competent for activation provided that MalT concentration was high enough .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>0 0.1 0.2 03 0.6 MalT ( PM ) ATP hydrolysis is not required for activation of open complex formation As shown in Figures 4 and 5 , AMP-PNP , a non-hydrolysable analogue of ATP , was as effective as ATP for activation of open complex formation by MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>As clearly shown here , activation of open complex formation by MalT does not require ATP hydrolysis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although MalT displays a weak ATPase activity , ATP hydrolysis is not required for promoter binding and activation of open complex formation ( 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT is endowed with a weak ATPase activity whose role is thus far elusive ; activation of open complex formation does not require ATP hydrolysis ( 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , this result clearly demonstrates that , in the presence of ATP , maltotriose inhibits formation of the MalT Â± MalY complex and makes us confident that the MalT Â± MalY interaction seen here is functionally relevant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT activity was assayed by monitoring its ability to activate open complex formation at malPp , a MalT-dependent promoter , in the presence of RNA polymerase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT was incubated with malPp DNA and AMP-PNP2 in the presence or absence of MalK before adding RNA polymerase and allowing open complex formation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT was preincubated with malPp in the presence of ATP , maltotriose , and various concentrations of Aes before adding RNA polym-erase and allowing open complex formation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT was preincubated with malPp DNA , ATP and maltotriose in the presence or absence of MalY , before adding RNA polymerase and allowing open complex formation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>We suggest that , in the nucieoprotein structure responsible for the initiation of transcription , MalT , RNA polymerase and malPp are held together by several weak interactions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>This clearly indicates a positive interaction between MalT and RNA polymerase on maiPp .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alternatively , CRP could act through specific protein-protein contacts with either MalT or the RNA polymerase holoenzyme .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , MalT might also interact with RNA polymerase and , in some of the MalT-dependent promoters , with the cyclic AMP receptor protein ( 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>
<li>Filtration of a sample containing both MalT and Aes gave two peaks at the positions at which MalT and Aes , respectively , elute when chromatographed alone .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Gel filtration of a mixture containing both proteins in the presence of ATP and maltotriose gave two peaks , at 1.11 and 1.32 ml , i.e. the volumes at which MalT and MalY , respectively , elute when filtered separately .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the above-mentioned experiments , complex formation was observed with a sample containing 9 M MalT and 9.5 M Aes , and no additional peak was observed , thereby suggesting that the MalT : Aes ratio in the inhibition complex is 1:1 ( protomer : protomer ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>The stability of the MalY dimer and the available stoichiometry data instead point to a complex containing one MalY dimer and two MalT protomers , with a predicted size of 293 kDa .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>What is the stoichiometry of the MalY Â± MalT complex ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>This argues against the possibility that the MalY Â± MalT complex contains one protomer of each protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that MalT needs to interact with two different ligands to achieve activation strongly suggests that the mechanism by which the protein acts is a complex one .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>As a result , the Aes-MalT complex might contain one protomer of each protein ( predicted molecular mass , 141 kDa ) or one Aes dimer and two MalT monomers ( predicted molecular mass , 281 kDa ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL , FimZ , UhpA and RcsB of subgroup ( c ) also certainly fall into the category of response regulator from the existence of phosphoryl-ation domain , although SdiA and MalT show the similarity to the above four regulatory proteins only in the C-terminal region containing the helix-turn-helix motif .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8729576" target="_blank">8729576</a>]<br></li>
<li>We speculate that a structural motif present in all three proteins , but not recognizable by sequence , interacts with MalT , thus inactivating the function of MalT as a transcriptional activator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9401025" target="_blank">9401025</a>]<br></li>
<li>Even though they do not exhibit sequence similarity , all three proteins must contain a similar structural motif by which they recognize MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>If so , it will be interesting to find out whether the three proteins recognize the same structural motif on MalT , even though they do not display any obvious homology at the sequence level .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , the 4 center-to-center distance between outer domains ( 49 AÌ ) is close to the center-to-center distance between two tandem MalT sites ( 45 AÌ ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT forms curvilinear homopolymers of varying length , with separate white globular domains in the outer layer and a continuous white line in the inner layer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the average map ( Figure 2A ) , MalT multimers contain an average number of seven or eight globular domains , forming the outer layer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Assuming a globular sphere with a diameter of 49 AÌ for the outer domain and a partial speciï¬c volume of 0.735 cm g as deter-3 K1 mined for MalT , one can calculate a molecular 3 mass of 50 kDa for the outer domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>The building block , corresponding to a MalT monomer , comprises an outer globular domain connected by a peduncle to an inner domain that mediates self-association .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Cryo-15 electron microscopy showed that , in the active form , i.e. in the presence of both ATP and maltotriose , MalT monomers consist of a globular domain connected by a peduncle to an inner domain , that mediates self-association into polydisperse homopolymers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>This inference is further supported by the observation that the Vibrio cholerae MalT ortholog has an arginine residue at the corresponding position .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>This last peak is presumed to contain the ( MalT ) n multimer in rapid equilibrium with aggregates of this multimer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>The first phase ( up to '10 mM MalT ) would reflect the formation of the ( MalT ) n multimer , and the major peak would contain the ( MalT ) n form in rapid equilibrium with dimer and/or monomer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>As revealed by limited proteolysis , maltotriose binding triggers a conformational change in MalT that involves domains 1 -- 3 and most likely reflects part of the postulated transition from the inactive form to the active form of MalT ( 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT is in equilibrium between an inactive and an active form with the negative effector stabilizing the inactive form and maltotriose stabilizing the active form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Presently , it is difï¬cult to assign the outer domain , the peduncle and the inner domain to any of the MalT structural domains that have been deï¬ned biochemically and crystallographically ( DT1 , 27 kDa ; DT2 , 22 kDa ; DT3 , 43 kDa ; and DT4 , 11 kDa ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Structural studies revealed that MalT is made of four domains : domain 1 ( DT1 ; residues 1 -- 241 ) , domain 2 ( DT2 ; residues 250 -- 436 ) , domain 3 ( DT3 ; residues 437 -- 806 ) and domain 4 ( DT4 ; residues 807 -- 901 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT consists of four structural domains ( 11 ) : domain 1 ( DT1 , aa 1 to 241 ) binds ATP , domains 2 ( DT2 , aa 250 to 436 ) and 3 ( DT3 , aa 437 to 806 ) bind the inducer , and domain 4 ( DT4 , aa 807 to 901 ) harbors the DNA-binding site ( 11 , 43 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>As proposed by Danot , MalT domains 24 14 1 , 2 and 3 form a novel signal transduction module , linked to an output domain , the activity of which the module controls via a change of its own quaternary structure .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>The transition between the inactive and the active form of MalT involves DT1 , DT2 , and DT3 , three domains that are specific to the MalT family of transcriptional activators and are thought to constitute a signal integration module ( 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>All of these regulatory signals are integrated by a novel signal transduction module that comprises three out of the four MalT structural domains : DT1 , the ATP-binding domain that contains determinants recognized by the negative effectors , DT2 , and DT3 , the maltotriosebinding domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Integration of 14,15 the regulatory signals is ensured by the three N-terminal domains , DT1 , DT2 and DT3 , which constitute a novel signal transduction module that is the signature of the MalT subfamily of STAND ATPases .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Besides the MalT family of transcriptional activators , the largest regulators that are structurally well-deï¬ned are the NtrC-type or the TyrR-type activators ( about 55 kDa ) , which are members of another family of transcriptional regulators and which are composed of three domains .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>The only feature that MalT shares with members of another family of transcriptional activators , the LuxR family , is a conserved C-terminal domain ( '10 kDa ) that contains * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Members of this subfamily have an amino-terminal phosphorylation domain characteristic of so-called two-component regulators , such as OmpR , CheY , PhoB , and NtrC , and a carboxyl-terminal domain conserved among many transcriptional activators , including LuxR and MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1569008" target="_blank">1569008</a>]<br></li>
<li>Insertions corresponding to two or three turns of.DNA helix ( 121 and 131 ) did not alter MalT binding to malEp-malKp , as compared to the wild-type .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , insertions of 1.5 or 2.5 turns of DNA helix ( 116 and 126 ) dramatically affect the way in which MalT interacts with malEp-malKp ( Fig. 7 and data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , it is difï¬cult to conclude whether the DNA and the MalT oligomers speciï¬cally interact via MalT recognition sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Only some of the enhancements and diminutions are indicated 6 11 important determinant for MalT interaction with the DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>Some structural ï¬exibility in the DT3-DT4 linker region might also uncouple the DNA-binding domains from constraints imposed by a heterologous pol-ymerization and allow them to bind cooperatively MalT sites in different orientations and with different spacer region lengths .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>This supports the notion that DT1 and DT2 are involved in inter - or intramolecular interactions taking place in the process of MalT activation and that these domain interactions are interfered by Aes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>

<li>On supercoiled DNA , each MalT binding site contained several G residues whose methylation was either enhanced or diminished ( Fig. 9 ) , thereby indicating that the five MalT binding sites were occupied .

<li>Transcription activation by MalT depends on the binding of the protein to an array of binding sites located upstream of the 235 region of the mal promoters ( 13 -- 15 ) and probably involves a contact between the RNA polymerase and a surface element located on the C-terminal domain of MalT ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>

<li>First , the fact that the presence of a MalT box at this position is the unique feature common to all the MalT-dependent promoters suggests that this binding site plays a key role in transcription-activation ( Chapon & Raibaud , 1985 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>Having two MalT binding sites in a direct repeat is a recurrent feature of mal promoters and plays a crucial role in their activation ( 281 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>If the latter hypothesis is correct , the MalK protein must have another patch involved in MalT recognition , in addition to that already identiï¬ed in its regulatory domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is worth noting that the structural complexity of the MalT monomer , as revealed by cryo-EM , parallels the complexity in domain composition of the protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the MalT -- BCCP fusion protein the striped box indicates the position of the BCCP biotinylation domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , the presence of the biotinylation domain ( BCCP ) attached to the C-terminus of MalT for protein immobilization renders MalT inactive in vivo ( Panagiotidis et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10692154" target="_blank">10692154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the existence of two distinct patches on MalK , in the regulatory domain and in the nucleotide-binding domain , respectively , would help explain how the ability of MalK to interact with MalT might be controlled by the activity of the transporter , as proposed by Panagiotidis et al. .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , as shown by Schlegel et al. , ( 33 ) the T38R substitution , isolated2 by Notley-McRobb and Ferenci ( 32 ) and located in MalT domain 1 ( DT1 ) , renders the protein insensitive to Aes in vivo , whereas it slightly increases its sensitivity to MalY , thereby suggesting that the substitution specifically alters the Aes binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Instead , the crystal structures of free and ATP-bound MalK dimers suggest that ATP hydrolysis is not accompanied by conformational changes of the C-termi-nal regulatory domain , where the MalT binding-site is located ( 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>By using a biochemical approach , we demonstrate here that ( i ) Aes controls MalT activity through direct pro-tein-protein interaction , ( ii ) Aes competes with maltotri-ose for MalT binding , ( iii ) ATP and ADP differentially affect the competition between Aes and the inducer , and ( iv ) part , if not all , of the Aes binding site is located in DT1 , the N-terminal domain of the activator , which also contains the ATP-binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>In both cases , the inhibitory protein is a negative effector of MalT that competes with the inducer for MalT binding and whose binding site is located on the N-terminal domain of the activator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>We found that the binding site for Aes is also likely to be contained in the N-terminal portion of MalT encompassing DT1 and DT2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>BoÌhm et al. ( 10 ) identified a surface determinant on the C-terminal domain of MalK that is specifically involved in MalT repression and might represent the MalT binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whereas the absence of MalK titration by DT1 in vivo excludes the possibility that the N-terminal domain of MalT harbors a major determinant of the MalK binding site ( 33 ) , it remains possible that DT1 contributes to MalK binding and that substitution T38R alters the DT1 element of the MalK binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>These sites would be located in DT1 and DT3 of MalT , and in the nucleotide-binding domain and the regulatory domain of MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , we have shown that part , if not all , of the Aes binding site is located on DT1 , the N-terminal domain of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Part , if not all , of the MalK-binding site is located on DT1 , the N-terminal domain of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , we have demonstrated that , when isolated , DT1 spe-cifically interacts with MalK , which indicates that part if not all of the MalK binding site is located on DT1 , the N-terminal domain of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Yet , the MalT/DT1 interaction is weak , which suggests that other MalT domains might contribute , directly or indirectly , to MalK binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>This finding obviously indicates that the substitution does not alter the DT1 surface element recognized by MalK but indirectly interferes with MalK binding via a conformational change involving other MalT domains .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , whereas most TPR proteins interact with their binding partner through the interior surface of the superhelix , in this case the interaction patch ( either with MalK or with a domain of MalT ) is located on the exterior surface of DT3 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , it is easy to imagine how interaction of MalK or another domain of MalT with the exterior cleft separating the ï¬fth and sixth helix bundles could change the curvature of the inner surface of the tunnel and preclude the binding of maltotriose , if it does bind in the tunnel , and , reciprocally , how maltotriose could prevent the H10/H11 motif from binding its target .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since MalK is known to bind DT1 , another domain of MalT , it was possible that the H10 / 10 H11 motif is important for MalK function ( i.e. repression of MalT activity ) but not for its binding to MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>This residue might therefore contribute 22 to the structure of a determinant located in the MalK nucleotide-binding domain and recognized by the H10/H11 motif of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , MalT is an ATP-binding protein , as suggested by the following lines of evidence : ( i ) ATP protects MalT against thermal denaturation , ( ii ) ATP can be photo-crosslinked to the protein , and ( iii ) the MalT polypeptide contains at its Nterminus an amino-acid sequence homologous to a conserved sequence ( Gly-X-X-Gly-X-Gly-Lys-Thr-Thr ) found in a large number of ATP - and GTP-binding proteins and considered to be part of the nucleotide-binding domain ( Richet and Raibaud , 1987 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , the carboxyl termini of the NarP and NarL proteins contain predicted helix-turn-helix motifs of the type that is found in other DNA-binding proteins such as MalT , FixJ , and RcsA ( Fig. 3 ) ( 18 , 42 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Members of the UhpA-LuxR family contain a predicted helix-turn-helix domain , and the specific binding of MalT to target sequences in promoter DNA has been demonstrated ( 22 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1569008" target="_blank">1569008</a>]<br></li>
<li>The C-termi-nal domains of the UhpA-family of response regulators contain a highly conserved segment predicted to form a helix-turn-helix motif that is similar to the DNA-binding regions of some transcription factors that are not regulated by protein phosphoryl-ation , such as MalT from E. coli and LuxR from Vibrio fischeri ( 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8999880" target="_blank">8999880</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , as 13,14 discussed below , images of the nucleoprotein complexes formed by MalT at the malPp500 promoter suggest that the DNA-binding domain is located on the outer domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>The two-domain structure of NarL ( Baikalov et al. , 1996 ) contains an N-terminal phosphorylation module tethered through a Â¯ exible linker to a C-terminal DNA-binding and activation domain that is highly conserved in otherwise unrelated transcription regulators , including MalT , LuxR and s70 ( Henikoff et al. , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10512697" target="_blank">10512697</a>]<br></li>
<li>When RcsA is limiting [ Ion * cells ) and RcsB is not activated by phosphorylation , the cps region is not transcribed The predicted protein sequences of both RcsA and RcsB contain a carboxy-terminal domain similar to that found in a class of DNA-binding proteins exemplified by UhpA , MalT , and FixJ ( Fig. 1 ; Stout etal .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1943696" target="_blank">1943696</a>]<br></li>
<li>The output domain is a C-terminal LuxR-type DNA-binding domain in the case of transcriptional activators homologous to MalT or a putative serine/threonine-speci ï¬c kinase domain , N-terminal to DT1 , in the case of the PknK protein from Micrococcus tuberculosis .

<li>Truncated forms of MalT lacking its C-terminal DNA-binding domain are negatively dominant over the function of the wild-type protein , indicating that the protein interacts with itself when binding to DNA ( 40 ) .

<li>However , it should be pointed out that MalT binding to the malEp - malKp region , which contains five MalT boxes , appears to be highly cooperative ( Raibaud et al. , 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>

<li>It establishes that MalY is a negative effector of MalT , the transcriptional activator of the regulon , and that it downregulates the activity of MalT through direct protein Â± protein interaction and by preventing inducer-binding .

<li>RESULTS The N-terminal 250 aa of MalT are sufï¬cient for the interaction with MalY in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>The observation that a peptide containing the N-terminal 250 aa of MalT was able to interfere with the MalT-MalY interaction in vivo and that DT1 , the N-terminal domain of MalT ( aa 1 to 241 ) , coelutes together with MalY during mo-lecular sieve chromatography demonstrates that DT1 contains at least part of the interaction site with MalY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the conformation of the isolated DT3 domain might differ from that of DT3 in the full-length MalT context .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>This DT1H-MalY interaction is speciï¬c since no complex could be observed when DT1H was replaced by DT3 , another domain of MalT , at the same molar concentration ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>The only structural domain of MalT contained in all fragments causing derepression is DT1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>This was conï¬rmed by gel ï¬ltration analysis , where MalY was shown to coelute with the N-terminal MalT structural domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here we show that one region in MalT that interacts with MalY is contained in the N-terminal domain , DT1 , as deï¬ned by Danot ( 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here , we report cryo-electron microscopy analyses of MalT multimeric forms .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Structural studies have revealed that MalT is composed of four domains ( 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>Biochemical and structural studies have provided insight into the structure of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Where in MalT do the repressors bind ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , GerE Bsu is only 74 residues in length while MalT Eco is 901 residues long .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7699720" target="_blank">7699720</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MalT polypeptide contains 22 tryptophan residues and 19 tyrosine residues .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10559195" target="_blank">10559195</a>]<br></li>
<li>Numbers refer to aa residues ( at the C-terminus of the MalT ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3015733" target="_blank">3015733</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , we have shown that the amino acid substitution T38R specifically impairs the interaction between Aes and DT1 or full-length MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the T38R substitution is located in DT1 , we considered the possibility that this amino acid substitution renders MalT insensitive to MalK by altering the DT1 determinant recognized by MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>As revealed by the x-ray structure of MalY , amino acid substitutions in MalY that impair MalT inhibition delineate a patch on the surface of the protein that most likely represents the MalT contact site ( 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>These mutations are located at positions 38 , 220 , 243 , and 359 , most likely deï¬ning the interaction patch with Aes on the three-dimensional structure of MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>The T38R substitution does not alter the specific activity of MalT ( in the presence of a saturating concentration of nucleoside triphosphate ) , nor does it suppress its ability to interact with MalY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11867639" target="_blank">11867639</a>]<br></li>
<li>In conclusion , all of the substitutions altering residues R634 , E636 , N637 , L638 , L639 , G640 and R656 enhance MalT activity under conditions of repression by MalK but have no signiï¬cant effect o MalT activity in the absence of repressor or in the presence of MalY or , in the cases of residues 634 , 636 , 637 and 639 , in the presence of Aes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the N637T substitution , which alters a surface-exposed residue , does not affect MalT activity in vitro , or its sensitivity to the inhibition by MalY or Aes , but fully prevents MalT inhibition by MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Computer-aided ï¬tting of the surface structure of MalK known to interact with MalT ( 1 ) onto the surface structure of DT3 ( 40 ) offered a possibility for a surprisingly tight ï¬t between the two proteins , a starting point for future mutant analysis in search of the MalK-MalT interface .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , such a hypothesis implies that the active form of MalT would be in equilibrium with at least two different inactive forms of MalT , and that only the form recognized by MalK would be stabilized by an intra-molecular domain/domain interaction mediated by the DT3 H10/H11 motif .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>The substituted amino acids are either part of a surface determinant , the H10/H11 motif , playing a crucial role in MalT repression by MalK or contribute to the correct exposition of this determinant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , its substitution with glycine might affect MalT repression by MalK , because it disrupts the salt-bridge between helices 10 and 11 and/or because it alters the H10/H11 motif surface .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>What is the function of the H10/H11 surface motif in MalT inhibition by MalK ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15733913" target="_blank">15733913</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this report we describe the use of tagged versions of MalT to provide evidence that it physically interacts with the MalK protein both in vitro and in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Before using this protein as a tool to study the ability of MalK and MalT to interact in vitro , we ï¬rst examined its ability to function in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>Results MalT and MalK interact in vivo We constructed a hybrid form of MalT , MalT -- BCCP , that contains the biotination signals from the BCCP protein ( Cronan , 1990 ) attached to the C-terminus of MalT ( see Fig. 1A ) to test the hypothesis that MalK antagonizes the transcriptional-activity of MalT via a direct physical interaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>If the interaction between MalK and the MalT -- BCCP hybrid is speciï¬c , extracts containing normal MalT protein would be expected to compete with the Fig. 1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conclude that MalK can speciï¬cally interact with both the MalT protein and the two hybrid MalT proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>To examine the ability of the His-6 -- MalK protein to interact with the MalT -- BCCP protein , extracts containing each protein were incubated together and then streptavidin-agarose beads were added to capture MalT -- BCCP and any interacting proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data provide compelling evidence that MalT physically interacts with MalK , that the interaction is functionally relevant , and that maltotri-ose prevents formation of the MalT-MalK complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT and MalK physically interact in vitro Even though the results obtained in vivo are consistent with a functional interaction between MalK and MalT , they do not demonstrate a direct physical interaction between the two proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>To ï¬nd out whether MalK and MalT form a binary complex or whether additional proteins participate in this interaction , we constructed the same His-6 -- MalK hybrid described by Davidson ( Davidson and Sharma , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is not known where in MalT the interaction with these proteins takes place .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since no relief of repression was observed even with the longest fragment , the site of MalK interaction in MalT must differ from the MalY-MalT interaction site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , interaction with MalK might occur at a position in MalT that is engaged in the activation ( multimerization ) mechanism .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>

<li>As a result , the ability of MalT to interact with MalK was possibly unregulated , and the secondary structural motifs involved in MalK recognition were permanently exposed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>

<li>This may indicate that the dimeric form of MalK is the one that interacts with MalT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalK Interacts with DT1 -- The similarity between the action modes of the three negative effectors of MalT suggests that , like MalY and Aes , MalK might interact with DT1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15180985" target="_blank">15180985</a>]<br></li>
<li>The regulatory domain of MalK also interacts with MalT , inhibiting its activity as a transcriptional activator ( 31 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16321936" target="_blank">16321936</a>]<br></li>
<li>The N terminus of MalT does not titrate MalK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12003949" target="_blank">12003949</a>]<br></li>
<li>The MalT sites in malPp were preciseiy located and their occupation as a function of MaiT concentration was quantified using DNase I and dimethyi sulphate footprinting experiments .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>It should be noted that we have presented the simplest model accounting for our present results and that this model relies on the assumption that the complex MalT forms in vitro with malEp-malKp is closely related to the structure actually responsible for transcription-activation in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>Some elements of this structure , namely the CRP site 1 , located at â 76.5 , and the distal MalT sites , seem to play a direct role in malEp activation besides their participation in the assembly of the higher-order structure .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The mechanism of activation by CRP is clearly different from that occurring at the divergent malEp-malKp promoters , which are simultaneously controlled by an array of three binding sites for CRP , all located at distal positions in between ( 36 ) , and forming a high-order structure responsible for activation , assisting direct activation by the MalT primary regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9573142" target="_blank">9573142</a>]<br></li>
<li>The binding of MalT and CRP to this region is known to result in the formation of a higher-order structure that is responsible for malKp activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since we recently purified the MalT protein ( Richet and Raibaud , submitted for publication ) , we reconsidered this problem of induction by studying the activation of a maltose regulon promoter in vitro .

<li>The purification of MalT in an active form and the development of a purified in vitro transcription system recently made the process of transcription-activation by MalT amenable to biochemical analysis ( Richet and Raibaud , 1987 ) .

<li>Interestingly , in many respects , MalT rather resembles the DnaA protein , the activator of initiation of DNA-replication in E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2524384" target="_blank">2524384</a>]<br></li>
<li>One of these proteins , MalT , a nonresponse regulator class 3 protein , is an ATP-dependent transcriptional activator ( Richet and Raibaud 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7699720" target="_blank">7699720</a>]<br></li>
<li>The presence of a wild-type malPQ + operon , which encodes enzymes involved in the catabolism of maltodextrins , further increases the concentration of active MalT in a malTp1 malTp7 background ( see below ) , possibly through an effect on the production of maltotriose ( the true inducer ) from maltose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>We also examined their role in the regulation of the malT gene , which encodes MalT and which is controlled by cAMP-CRP ( 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9829919" target="_blank">9829919</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has also been demonstrated that MalK , a component of the ABC-type transporter for maltose , physically interacts with MalT to downregulate its transcriptional activity in response to the levels of ATP-hydrolysis associated with maltose-transport ( Panagiotidis et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11157755" target="_blank">11157755</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to its role in transport , MalK influences maltose gene-expression , probably by competing with the endogenous inducer for MalT , .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9884223" target="_blank">9884223</a>]<br></li>
<li>Dextrin-metabolizing or synthesizing enzymes affect the level of internal maltotriose , the inducer of the system which is recognized by MalT ; cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) / CAP , as well as the product of the mlc gene , controls the expression of malT itself ; and the levels of MalK , the ATP-hydrolyzing subunit of the transport system , as well as of MalY ( a bC-S lyase ) and of Aes ( an esterase with homology to lipases ) affect the expression of the maltose-transport genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to other maltose operon promoters , which are regulated only by MalT : malEp and malKp are also positively controlled by CRP , a pleiotropic regulator involved in the control of carbon source utilization ( De Crombrugghe et al. , 1984 ; Chapon , 1982 ; Richet & Raibaud , 1987 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>

<li>Summary The promoters of the Escherichia coll maltose regulon are positively regulated by the MalT protein , which recognizes a short asymmetric nucieotide sequence that is present as severai copies in each promoter of the regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of maltotriose and ATP , MalT , the activator protein specific for the regulon , binds to a short asymmetrical sequence which is present in several copies in alt the MalT-dependent promoters ( Vidal-lngigiiardi etai , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of both effectors , MalT binds to the asymmetric 5 ' - GGAT/GGA nucleotide sequence which is present in several copies in the mal promoters ( 32 ) and , by an unknown mechanism , increases the rate of open complex formation at these promoters ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180908" target="_blank">2180908</a>]<br></li>
<li>Instead , the asymmetric hexanucleotide sequence 59-GG A ( G/T ) GA-39 , the so-called MalT box , was identiï¬ed centered at bp 237.5 or at 238.5 upstream of the transcriptional start point ( 9 , 10 , 106 , 201 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9529892" target="_blank">9529892</a>]<br></li>

<li>Transcription activation by 1,2 MalT involves MalT self-association , cooperative 3 binding to several copies of a 10 bp asymmetric recognition motif ( 5 0-ggGGa ( T/G ) GAgg-30 ) that are located in the target promoters , and stimulation 4 -- 6 of open complex formation by RNA polymerase .

<li>MalT is known to prevent DNase I attack over a stretch of about 16bp centred around a decanucleotide homologous to the consensus sequence GGGGAT / GGAGG .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>

<li>An attractive alternative hypothesis is that the homology represents the inducer recognition site , implying that MalI and MalT bind the same sugar .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2670898" target="_blank">2670898</a>]<br></li>
<li>The observation of sequences that are homologous in the three proteins MalK , MalT , and MalI would speak for a common sugar recognition site in these proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2670898" target="_blank">2670898</a>]<br></li>

<li>If , as just proposed , the sequence T - ( ` - C ' - T - ( I-KZZ-C : - A - ( : - G-A constitutes a recognition site for the MalT protein , a similar sequence would be expected t ' o be found at the two other known malT-controlled ma1 promoters ( Bedouelle $ Hofnung , 1982 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=6379197" target="_blank">6379197</a>]<br></li>
<li>A comparison of the sequences at the three malT-controlled ma1 promoters ( Bedouelle et al. , 1982 ) and the mapping of one promoter-down mutation in the malK 1amB operon ( Bedouelle , 1983 ) already led to the suggestion that the G-G-A-G-G-A sequence located in the vicinity of position - 35 both in the malK 1amB and malEFG operons might be part of the interaction site for MalT protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=6379197" target="_blank">6379197</a>]<br></li>
<li>As a working hypothesis , we propose that the G-A-G-G-A sequence present in the vicinity of the - 35 position and the inverted-repeat of the sequence located in the vicinity of position - 60 constitute recognition sequences for the MalT protein at the malPQ promoter .

<li>( e ) MalT binding to malEp-malKp induces DNA bending in the central region A close examination of the central region separating the protected areas reveals a regular pattern of alternately increased and decreased sensitivity to DNase I cleavage , which spans -110 bp on both st , rands ( Figs 4 and 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>A head-to-tail association is consistent with the observation that the motif comprising two directly repeated MalT sites , separated by 3 bp ( sites 2 and 3 in malPp500 ( Figure 5A ) ) , is a recurrent feature in all of the MalT-dependent promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15491603" target="_blank">15491603</a>]<br></li>
<li>Such a model relies , of course , on the premise that several levels of ï¬exibility allow for the simultaneous occupation of the MalT sites that are further apart than tandem sites ( such as sites 3 and 4 in pulAp-pulCp , which are separated by 11 bp ) or that 4 are both further apart and in opposite orientations ( such as sites 1 and 2 in malPp500 , which are separated by 13 bp ( Figure 5A ) ) .

<li>Discussion Functionai and non-functionai activator-binding sites in maIPp The exact location of the nucieotide sequences to which MalT actually binds in the MalT-dependent promoters is often not easiiy defined , as these sequences sometimes exhibit only 60 % identity with the consensus ( Vidal-Ingigiiardi et ai .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of ATP and maltotriose , MalT binds to decanucleotide MalT boxes that are found upstream of mal promoters and activates transcription at these sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9822819" target="_blank">9822819</a>]<br></li>
<li>MalT binds cooperatively to multiple sites in MalT-dependent promoters ( 22 , 23 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1569008" target="_blank">1569008</a>]<br></li>
<li>Genetic data strongly suggest that this sequence is part of the MalT binding site ( Bedouelle , 1983 ; Gutierrez & Raibaud , 1984 ; Raibaud et al. , 1985 ) , but direct evidence that MalT binds to the `` MalT box '' is so far lacking .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2538630" target="_blank">2538630</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of these two ligands , MalT binds to a degenerate decanucleotide sequence , 58-GGGGA ( T/G ) GAGG-38 ( T box ) , that is found in various permutations upstream of all mal promoters ( Richet and Raibaud , 1989 ; Vidal-Ingigliardi et al. , 1991 ) .

<li>The end points of the malEp upstream deletions malEpD64 and malEpD92 ( Raibaud et al. , 1989 ) are indicated Results Each set of three MalT sites ( 3/4/5 and 3 ' / 4 ' / 5 ' ) forms a functional unit to which MalT binds cooperatively ( Danot & Raibaud , 1994 ; Richet et al. , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that this region iies between sites 2/3 and site 1 in maiPp leads us to speculate that MalT bound to sites 2/3 interacts with the a-subunits , in such a modei , MaiT and RNA poiymerase would form a nucieoprotein complex heid together by several proteinprotein interactions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7830577" target="_blank">7830577</a>]<br></li>
<li>To ensure that the occupation of MalT sites 1 and 2 observed with malEp + was not due to a stabilizing effect of RNA polymerase bound at malEp and/or malKp , I veriï¬ed that MalT sites 1 and 2 were similarly occupied in the absence of functional â 10 sequences .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>The occupancy of MalT sites 1 and 2 does not result from stabilization by RNA polymerase bound to malEp because the inactivation of the â 10 element of malEp does not alter the degree of protection of MalT sites 1 and 2 of the malEpKp1 ,2,3 , I3 variant in pop2226 ( Figure 5 ( a ) ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9000616" target="_blank">9000616</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , a synthetic promoter containing the malPp â 35 / â 10 region and two consensus MalT sites located at the same position and in the same orientation as the MalT sites 1 and 2 present in malEp displays a signiï¬cant level of MalT-dependent activity ( Danot & Raibaud , 1993 ) .

<li>As 4,26 revealed by DNase I protection experiments , MalT binding to a set of MalT sites often gives rise , at saturating concentrations of the activator , to a regular pattern of alternating clusters of enhanced and diminished DNase I cleavage sites that are separated by 5 bp .
