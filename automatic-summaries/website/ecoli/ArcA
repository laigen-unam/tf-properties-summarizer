<li>Since these observations were made in both the presence ( 5 mM ) and the absence of IPTG , it appears that LacImediated repression of the phage T5 promoter of pQE30ArcA is incomplete in cells which also harbor either the pREP4 or q pACYC184lacI plasmid ( both of which constitutively express the lacI gene ) .

<li>Because the PDH and 2-KGDH complexes , in which LipA and LpdA participate , are among the most drastically downregulated in response to oxygen shortage ( Smith & Neidhardt 1983b ) , and both the lipA and lpdA strains consume less oxygen compared to wt ( Figure 3A ) , we tested whether the hypoxia transcription factor ArcA becomes essential in these strains , even under relative abundance of environmental oxygen .

<li>Thus , changes in oxygen availability ( sensed directly by FNR , and indirectly by ArcA ) affect the redox state of the system , leading to consequences for metal ion homeostasis ( copper , molybdate , iron ; sensed by CusR , ModE and Fur ) , iron -- sulphur cluster turnover ( sensed by IscR ) , ribonucleotide reductase activity 20 0 31 0 10 aerobiosis ( % ) time ( min ) Figure 1 .

<li>Since a 10-fold increase in enzyme activity was observed in response to oxygen availability , we examined whether the ArcA regulatory protein was involved in this control ( Iuchi & Lin , 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9202484" target="_blank">9202484</a>]<br></li>
<li>Aerobically , none of the genes showed a signiﬁcant difference in transcript levels between the wild type and DarcA , which was not surprising given that ArcA has very little activity in the presence of oxygen ( Iuchi & Lin , 1991 ) .

<li>A number of response-regulator proteins undergo autophosphorylation in vitro when incubated in the presence of various low-molecular-weight organo-phosphoryl compounds ( 3 , 11 , 15 , 20 , 21 , 30 -- 32 , 35 , 43 ) , and puriﬁed ArcA has been reported to autophosphorylate in the presence of either acetyl phosphate or carbamoyl phosphate ( 13 ) .

<li>Synthesis of the AppY protein is regulated by the ArcA regulator , which responds to changes in respiration ( 21 ) , and the AppY protein is itself activated in response to anaerobiosis ( 7 ) , probably by association with a low-molecular-weight effector like some of the other members of the AraC family of activators .

<li>Progress up the aerobiosis scale in the greater than 0 -- 85 per cent AU range enhances flux through the aerobic electron transport chain ( fed by the major primary dehydrogenases , Nuo and Ndh , and terminating in the major oxidases , Cyd and Cyo ) such that oxidized Q is available to inhibit ArcB autokinase activity and the concentrations of fermentation products are lowered , resulting in conversion of ArcA P to inactive ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , rapid ArcA phosphorylation occurred in the presence of H1-D1-H2 or H1-D1 plus H2 and the effect of H2 was observed to be dependent on its concentration .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>
<li>Incubations of various combinations of Arc proteins with [ g-32P ] ATP indicated that H1 , but not D1 or H2 , catalyzes autophosphorylation ; that H1-P transfers the phosphoryl group to D1 much more rapidly than to ArcA ; and that D1 accelerates the transphosphorylation of H2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Fig. 8 , when the three response-regulators were individually incubated with H1-D1 in the absence or presence of H2 for 2 min , signiﬁcant phosphor-ylation occurred only with ArcA and only when H2 was present ( Fig. 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test this hypothesis , H1 and H2 were incubated together with [ g-32P ] ATP for 45 min to form pools of H1-P and H2-P , ArcA was added , and the changes in the radioactivity associated with each protein were monitored ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>
<li>When purified ArcA was incubated with [ y-32P ] ATP for 5 min , the protein was not labeled ( Fig. 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>In one experiment , H1 and D1 were incubated with [ g-32P ] ATP for 2 min before ArcA was introduced .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>

<li>H1-D1 ( 50 pmol ) was incubated in 5-ml reaction mixtures with [ g-32P ] ATP for 2 min with ArcA ( 100 pmol ) , CpxR ( 200 pmol ) , or PhoB ( 100 pmol ) in the presence ( 1 ) or absence of H2 ( 100 pmol ) .

<li>The ArcB protein is a transmembrane protein which senses unfavourable respiratory conditions , undergoes autophosphorylation , then transfers its phosphoryl group to the ArcA regulatory protein , which then becomes functionally active ( luchi and Lin , 1992 ; luchi et al. , 1990 ) , Analogies with the OmpR-EnvZ family of two-component regulatory systems ( Stock et al. , 1989 ) , genetic evidence and the finding of a helix-turn-helix motif in the ArcA protein suggest that ArcA binds to DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA exists in a partially active DNA-binding form during aerobic cell growth and becomes fully activated by the ArcB protein when the cell perceives the microaerophilic condition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071201" target="_blank">8071201</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the two-component systems that respond to anaerobiosis ( ArcB/ArcA ) or osmolarity ( EnvZ/OmpR ) constitute signal transduction pathways in which both the membrane sensor protein and the DNA-binding effector are post-translationally activated via sequential phosphorylations ( for a review see Wurgler-Murphy and Saito , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9564045" target="_blank">9564045</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA ArcA forms a typical two-component signal transduction module , along with the membrane protein ArcB , which is activated in response to hypoxia and then activates ArcA by phosphorylation ( Georgellis et al. 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707865" target="_blank">20707865</a>]<br></li>
<li>Quinones are electron carriers where isoprenoid chain anchors them to the membrane , and those are thought to regulate the ArcB-ArcA two component system in response to redox state , which results in a release of quinone inhibition on ArcB , and subsequent autophosphorylation of ArcB and activation of arcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21272324" target="_blank">21272324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both of these controls are mediated by the two-component signal transduction system ArcB/ArcA , although sensitivity to the control is much more striking for L-lactate dehydrogenase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8407843" target="_blank">8407843</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA , like other regulators of the two-component system , becomes functional when phosphorylated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412675" target="_blank">8412675</a>]<br></li>
<li>Multimerization of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated ArcA is necessary for the response-regulator function of the Arc two-component signal transduction system .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25161193" target="_blank">25161193</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>This model is supported by the requirement for phosphorylation of ArcA to-bind to DR3 , which is also known to promote dimer formation among OmpR/PhoB response-regulators ( 20 , 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25161193" target="_blank">25161193</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylated BarA , in turn , acts as an efficient phosphoryl group donor to UvrY but not to the non-cognate response-regulators ArcA , PhoB , or CpxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11022030" target="_blank">11022030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Third , BarA catalyzes the phosphorylation of UvrY but not the phosphorylation of the non-cognate response-regulators ArcA , PhoB , or CpxR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11022030" target="_blank">11022030</a>]<br></li>
<li>For estimation of the phosphorylation state , various response-regulators ( DcuR , ArcA , NarL ) were subjected to isoelectric focussing .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15073297" target="_blank">15073297</a>]<br></li>
<li>Determination of the time course of phosphorylation of ArcA and RssB was started by the addition of the response-regulators to previously phosphorylated ArcB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>In competition experiments involving ArcB and both response-regulators ArcA and RssB , one response-regulator was used at a constant concentration ( 1 µM for ArcA , 0.85 µM for RssB ) and increasing amounts of the other response-regulator ( 0.5 -- 5 µM ) were included in the reaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Firstly , in response to an external stimulus the authentic transmitter can be targeted to the receiver module of the cognate response-regulator ( e.g. ArcA ; luchi , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7957084" target="_blank">7957084</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA , on the other hand , is a cytoplasmic response-regulator that is activated for transcriptional control by phosphorylation of an aspartyl residue in its receiver module domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8824175" target="_blank">8824175</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rather , ArcA acts as direct repressor at the rpoSp1 promoter even in the absence of ArcB , and ArcB acts as a sensor kinase that directly phosphorylates and thereby activates the response-regulator RssB , which targets S for proteolysis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon transition to anaerobiosis , the response-regulator ArcA is phosphorylated and activated by its sensor kinase ArcB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>bound sensor kinase and ArcA as the cognate response-regulator ( Fig. 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10851007" target="_blank">10851007</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Fig. 5B , ArcB was an efficient kinase for its cognate response-regulator , ArcA , but failed to transphosphorylate UvrY at a detectable level .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11022030" target="_blank">11022030</a>]<br></li>
<li>This also means that in the presence of a limited ArcB-P supply , RssB phosphorylation is exquisitely sensitive against even small changes in the concentration of competing ArcA ( but not vice versa ) , a feature that the cell may use to control RssB phosphorylation and thereby S proteolysis ( see below ; Fig. 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>This energy supply signaling in the control of S may be further accentuated by acetyl phosphate , which can phosphorylate both RssB and ArcA , and whose cellular concentration also varies with the energy supply ( McCleary and Stock 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since ArcA phosphorylation from ArcB78-778 is ∼ 10 times more rapid than RssB phosphorylation , ArcA phosphorylation is not significantly reduced even in the presence of increased concentrations of RssB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA efficently competes with RssB for transphosphorylation from ArcB78-778 , as shown with increasing concentrations of ArcA ( Fig. 5B , C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Increasing concentrations of RssB , however , do not significantly interfere with ArcA phosphorylation ( Fig. 5D , E ) , which is explained by the strongly different kinetics of phosphorylation of RssB and ArcA ( Fig. 5F , G ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Another interesting observation is that small concentrations of RssB ( up to equimolar with ArcA ) reproducibly stimulated ArcA phosphorylation to some extent ( Fig. 5D , E ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , this induction is enhanced by a positive feedback that involves S-dependent induction of ArcA , which further reduces S proteolysis , probably by competing with RssB for residual phosphorylation by ArcB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>In parallel , the role of ArcA changes to that of an agonist of S , as it becomes part of a positive feedback that further stabilizes S ; arcA expression increases in a partially S-dependent manner ( Fig. 6A , B ) , and ArcA plays a positive role in S stabilization in starved cells ( Fig. 6C ) , as even small increases in ArcA concentration efficiently interfere with RssB phosphorylation by ArcB ( especially when phosphorylated ArcB is in reduced supply as in cells that enter into an energy starvation situation ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>In an in vitro RssB -- S interaction assay ( based on affinity chromatography and coelution of the binding partners ) ( Becker et al. 1999 ) , we observed that the previously demonstrated acetyl-phosphate-mediated phosphorylation and activation of RssB could be fully replaced by ArcB78-778 and [ 32P ] ATP , and that the presence of ArcA in the assay also interfered with RssB binding to S , as expected for ArcA competing with RssB for ArcB-dependent phosphorylation ( Fig. 5H ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Due to inactivation of ArcB by oxidized quinones ( Georgellis et al. 2001a ; for a detailed discussion , see below ) , entering into poor nutritional -- i.e. , energy-starvation -- condition ( in the presence of oxygen ) should reduce ArcB-mediated phosphorylation of ArcA and RssB , and as a consequence , S should be induced .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>One mechanism of induction is via ArcA , which induces ornithine decarboxylase ( Evans et al. , 2011 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23531166" target="_blank">23531166</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the oxygen tension drops , ArcA is phosphorylated by ArcB and activates cydAB transcription ( Iuchi et al. , 1990 ; Cotter and Gunsalus , 1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>As the oxygen tension is decreased , ArcA becomes phosphorylated by ArcB and binds at the ArcA-I , ArcA-II and ArcA-III sites ( Lynch and Lin , 1996 ) to activate cydAB expression strongly ( Tseng et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>As phosphorylated RssB does not exhibit intrinsic autophosphatase actvity and is stable over at least 2 h ( Klauck et al. 2001 ) , we could also test whether ArcB can act as a phosphatase for prephosphorylated RssB and whether reverse phosphate flow from prephosphorylated RssB via ArcB78-778 to ArcA can occur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylation of ArcA by acetyl phosphate can also occur , and in the absence of ArcB , is likely to become relevant for ArcA activity ( Pena-Sandoval et al. 2005 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been proposed that the reduced form of a component of the terminal respiratory chain is sensed by ArcB , causing It to mediate ArcA activation ( luchi et al. , 1990a ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>The highly phosphorylated ArcB transfers the phosphate group to ArcA ( Iuchi & Lin , 1992 ; Tsuzuki et al. , 1995 ; Georgellis et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is in contrast to ArcA , for which ArcB can act as a phosphatase ( Georgellis et al. 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon stimulation ArcB undergoes autophosphorylation , and the phosphoryl group is transferred to ArcA by a His-Asp-His-Asp phosphorelay ( Georgellis et al. , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>
<li>The extent of ` ArcB autophosphorylation during 10 min of incubation in reaction mixtures containing different concentrations of [ y-32P ] ATP , however , indicated that 100 nM was a feasible concentration to use for our further studies of transphosphorylation from ` ArcB-P to ArcA ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>Each reaction mixture containng the same concentration of ArcA ( 21 pmol ) but different concentrations of ` ArcB ( 0.15 , 0.3 , 0.61 , 1.22 , 2.44 , 4.9 , or 9.8 pmol ) was incubated for 10 min .

<li>ArcZ directly represses , and is repressed by , arcB transcription , providing a negative feedback loop that may affect functioning of the ArcA -- ArcB regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , as oxygen becomes depleted and the ubiquinone pool becomes more reduced , the kinase activity of ArcB is activated , ArcA is phosphorylated , and many genes required for aerobic meta-bolism are repressed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16417494" target="_blank">16417494</a>]<br></li>
<li>If so , plasmids that increased the activity of the ArcB sensor kinase or directly activated ArcA would be expected to downregulate the ParcZ fusion , whereas plasmids that led to less ArcA activity or titrated ArcA from ParcZ would be expected to upregulate the fusion .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>D-Lactate inhibits the phosphatase activity that re - moves phosphoaspartate groups from the receiver module in ArcB , and the associated increase in phos - phorylation of this module leads to an activation of transphosphorylationof subsequently added phospho - histidine groups on ArcBto the receiver moduleof ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8226939" target="_blank">8226939</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcB autokinase activity is enhanced by : ( i ) the absence of inhibition by oxidized quinone ( Q ) [ 28 ] ; and ( ii ) fermentation product ( D-lactate , acetate , pyruvate ) mediated activation of kinase activity and inhibition of ArcA P dephosphosphorylation [ 29,30 ] .

<li>Also , in anaerobiosis , reduced intermediates of the electrontransport chain will trigger phosphorylation of ArcB , which in turn activates ArcA to become a repressor of both aerobic respiration ( 43 , 44 ) and the sodA gene ( refs .

<li>An in vivo study utilizing ArcB domains borne by a low-copy-number plasmid led to the conclusion that the phosphoryl group from His292 could be transferred to ArcA and that this transfer was regulated by the nature of the carbon source .

<li>A reduclion in the oxygen concentration is sensed by the membrane-associated ArcB protein whioh , subsequent to autophosphoryfation , transfers the phosphate group to ArcA ( luchi and Lin , 1992 ; iuchi , 1993 ) .

<li>Purified ArcB78-778 , RssB , ArcA , and [ 32P ] ATP were coincubated in various combinations and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>hen the receiver module is phosphorylated , it allows the transmitter module-P to transfer the phosphoryl group to ArcA , whereas when the receiver module is not phosphorylated , it inhibits this reaction .

<li>ArcB TransphosphorylationActivityfor ArcA Is Stimulated by D-Lactate-According to the results obtained with the D533A and D576A proteins , no transphosphorylation occurred from ArcB-P to ArcA when the receiver module was not phosphorylated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8226939" target="_blank">8226939</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similarly , ArcA ( 31 pmol ) was phosphorylated for 10 min by 14 pmol of ` ArcB in a 30-pl reaction mixture , and the proteins were denatured .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our data shown here not only provide evidence that phosphorylation of RssB by ArcB is physiologically relevant and results in active RssB able to-bind S , but also demonstate intricate differences in ArcA and RssB phosphorylation by ArcB that can contribute to fine-tuning of the physiological roles of phosphorylated ArcA and RssB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>This latter result indicated that the phosphorylation of ArcA via His717 depended on the presence of His292 and Asp576 and that the phosphorelay involved an intermolecular reaction between different ArcB domains , in agreement with the results of our previous in vitro study ( 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10851007" target="_blank">10851007</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the basis of the in vitro studies of luchi , it is interesting to speculate that ArcA responds to the intracellular accumulation of reduced compounds formed during cell metabolism or of fermentation end products via the ArcB protein ( 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>]<br></li>
<li>The amount of phosphorylated ArcA correlated with the predicted ArcA activities and with aerobiosis , suggesting that fermentation product-mediated inhibition of ArcB phosphatase activity is the dominant mechanism for regulating ArcA activity under the conditions used here .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21252224" target="_blank">21252224</a>]<br></li>
<li>The good correlation between inferred ArcA activity , ArcA phosphorylation , and aerobiosis ( i.e. qacetate ) implies that fermentation products influence ArcA activity , presumably by inhibition of ArcB phosphatase activity as shown by Iuchi ( 20 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21252224" target="_blank">21252224</a>]<br></li>
<li>The phenotypic consequences of ArcB modiﬁcation were analyzed by changes in the in vivo levels of phosphorylated ArcA ( ArcA-P ) , as indicated by expressions of target operons .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10851007" target="_blank">10851007</a>]<br></li>
<li>The latter finding suggests that either ArcA may exert this function also in the nonphosphorylated state or that in the absence of ArcB , ArcA is phosphorylated by another histidine sensor kinase or small mol-ecule phosphodonor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been shown that the presence of ubiquinones inhibits activation of the ArcB/ArcA system , while an abundance of menaquinones alleviates this inhibition , leading to activation of ArcA ( 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>The activation of ArcA by ArcB is shown by the dotted arrow .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>]<br></li>
<li>The effect of ` ArcB concentration on the rate of ArcA phosphorylation was tested during a 10-min incubation period .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>The proportionality between the rate of phosphorylation of purified ArcA ( in excess ) and the concentration of ` ArcB purified is consistent with a direct intermolecular phosphoryl group transfer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>The protein concentrations ( in pmol ) were 50 9BarA , 100 UvrY , 100 ArcA , 100 PhoB , 100 CpxR , and 50 ArcB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11022030" target="_blank">11022030</a>]<br></li>
<li>The repression is initiated by autophosphorylation of the sensor protein ArcB , followed by phosphoryl group transfer to the regulator ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8132465" target="_blank">8132465</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , there is no evidence for direct phosphoryl group transfer from His292 to ArcA or for the phosphorylation of ArcA by an unknown kinase via the H2 domain of ArcB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10851007" target="_blank">10851007</a>]<br></li>
<li>Now with the steric hindrance relieved as a result of a conformational change brought about by Asp-576 phosphorylation , ArcB becomes an effective kinase for ArcA ( luchi and Lin , 1992a , b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412675" target="_blank">8412675</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon stimulation , ArcB undergoes two autophosphorylations and transfers a phosphoryl group to ArcA , which then becomes functional ( luchi and Lin , 1992a , b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>( A ) Purified ArcB ( 0.067 µM ) , RssB ( 0.85 µM ) , and/or ArcA ( 1.0 µM ) were coincubated for 30 min in the presence of [ 32P ] ATP in the combinations as indicated in the figure ( for details of protein purification and the transphosphorylation conditions , see Materials and Methods ) .

<li>ArcA is activated through phosphorylation by a membrane protein ArcB , where this phosphorylation occurs after quinone inhibition of ArcB autophosphorylation is released [ 35 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21272324" target="_blank">21272324</a>]<br></li>

<li>( B ) In order to test competition between ArcA and RssB for phosphorylation by ArcB , the assay was done as in A , but increasing concentrations of ArcA were used as indicated in the figure .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of ATP , the ArcB trans - mitter module undergoes autophosphorylation and then transfers the phosphorylgroup to its own receive module as well as to the ArcA receiver module .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8226939" target="_blank">8226939</a>]<br></li>
<li>When ArcA was incubated in the presence of ` ArcB and [ y-32PJATP , ArcA acquired radioactivity at the expense of the phosphorylated protein ` ArcB-32P .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>When a limited amount of ` ArcB was incubated with excess ArcA and [ , ArcA-32P increased linearl with time .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>In another experiment , ArcA and [ g-32P ] ATP were incubated with different combinations of ArcB fragments and the kinetics of ArcA phosphorylation was monitored .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>
<li>To monitor the time course of ArcA phosphorylation , [ y-32P ] ATP was added to a reaction mixture containing ArcA and ` ArcB at a molar ratio of 20:1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>A reaction mixture ( 50 , u ) containing ArcA ( 103 pmol ) and ` ArcB ( 4.9 pmol ) was incubated in the presence of [ - y-32P ] ATP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , if H-NS was not inactivated , rather , it can still bind to the promoter but its binding was antagonized by ArcA , then its binding to the gadE promoter should be resumed when ArcA is absent and an increase of PgadE-lacZ activity should be observed in hns arcA than arcA single deletion strain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>More interestingly , the increased transcription of lacZ fusions in arcA hns double deletion strain than that in arcA single deletion strain was also observed in the case of individual P3 and P1 promoters , suggesting that ArcA antagonization of H-NS takes place at multiple sites in the PgadE promoter , consistent with the notion that both H-NS and ArcA can oligomerize and bind to a broad region in its regulated gene promoters ( Green and Paget , 2004 ; Dorman , 2006 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>This , combined with the fact that MnmE itself does not have DNA binding property whereas ArcA was shown to directly bind to PgadE and activate its expression , led us to speculate that the effect of mnmE on gadE-mdtEF expression may be indirect , i.e. , MnmE may affect the translation and/or activity of ArcA ( such as through affecting its phosphorylation ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since mnmE resulted in a similar pattern of decreased transcription from both full length and various truncation promoter fusions as in arcA strain except to a less extent , and ArcA was shown to directly bind to PgadE , we had speculated that MnmE regulation of the gadE expression was through its effect on ArcA , i.e. , through its mediation of the translation and/or phosphorylation of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Figure 2A , deletion of arcA caused dramatic decrease of the β-galactosidase activity of PgadE-lacZ , conﬁrming the role of ArcA in activating the gadE-mdtEF expression under anaerobic condition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Figure 6B , transcription of PgadE-lacZ in arcA hns double deletion did display signiﬁcantly higher activity than that in arcA strain , suggesting that the anaerobically up-regulated gadE-mdtEF expression was through the antagonization of H-NS mediated repression by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , under anaerobic condition , while arcA almost completely abolished transcription of gadE-mdtEF , further deletion of hns in arcA mutant restored the transcription of the full-length PgadE-lacZ , and P1 - and P3-lacZ fusions , suggesting an antagonistic effect of ArcA on the H-NS mediated repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Figure 7 , as expected , transcription of PicdA-lacZ and PlpdA-lacZ fusions were signiﬁcantly repressed by ArcA under anaerobic condition , since arcA caused de-repression of their transcription under anaerobic condition in M9 glucose medium , the same condition used in this study .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Figure 3 , PgadE-lacZ activities in wild type strain , and in arcA , mnmE , evgA , ydeO , gadE , gadX mutants are very low ( around 20 Miller units ) , consistent with the fact that ArcA is not active under this condition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>THE EFFECT OF MnmE ON THE ANAEROBIC ACTIVATION OF gadE-mdtEF IS NOT THROUGH ArcA As shown in Figure 4 , mnmE caused a very similar pattern on the transcription activities of the various PgadE truncations as that caused by arcA , only to a less extent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Response of flagellin , OppA and GltI to H2O2 is altered in the ΔarcA mutant E. coli To investigate the mechanisms of H2O2 resistance mediated by ArcA , we performed two-dimensional gel electro-phoresis to examine the protein profiles in the arcA mutant E. coli in the presence or absence of H2O2 , and compared to those of the wild type E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19715602" target="_blank">19715602</a>]<br></li>
<li>Lack of ArcA results in a ~ 6-fold decrease in the concentration of acetate in the medium of the lipA mutant ( Figure 6A ) , but has no effect on extracellular acetate in the lpdA strain ( figure S4A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707865" target="_blank">20707865</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consistent with the enhanced activity of Acs in the absence of ArcA , the lipA arcA mutant contains less ATP than the lipA strain ; lack of acs restores ATP concentration in the lipA arcA acs mutant to the levels of the lipA mutant ( Figure 4A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707605" target="_blank">20707605</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the previously published effect of ArcA on extracellular acetate accumulation in wt E. coli ( Vemuri et al. , 2006 ) is related to either the bacterial ` Crabtree effect ' , whereby lack of ArcA increases the capacity of the TCA cycle to consume the pyruvate formed by the oxidation of glucose resulting in the decreased formation of acetate ( Wolfe , 2005 ) , or to the suppression of acetate uptake by ArcA that we are hereby reporting for the lipA strain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707605" target="_blank">20707605</a>]<br></li>
<li>When activated anaerobically by the membrane sensor protein encoded by arcB , ArcA typically represses a number of operons of aerobic function ( Iuchi and Lin 1988 ; Iuchi et al. 1990b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1851949" target="_blank">1851949</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the presence of the ArcA peaks correlated with the presence of a strong σ70 peak comparing with the very low σ70 peak on this region under aerobic condition ( Park and Kiley , et al. , unpublished data , pers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>CHIP-chip data of H-NS and ArcA are also consistent with this proposal , as characterized by a broad peak of H-NS binding to PgadE under aerobic conditions and the replacement of this broad peak by that of ArcA under anaerobic conditions ( Park and Kiley et al. , unpublished data , pers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Direct in vivo binding of ArcA to the upstream regions of the genes involved in the b-oxidation pathway in the absence of oxygen recognition matrix , along with BindGene , as was done with fadL and fadD ( Liu & De Wulf , 2004 ; Robison et al. , 1998 ; Shen & Gunsalus , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Many studies have been done to examine the effect of ArcA and FNR on regulation of the electron transfer chain genes and the TCA cycle genes ( e.g. Cotter et al. , 1990 ; Iuchi et al. , 1990 ; Cotter and Gunsalus , 1992 ; Chao et al. , 1997 ; Cook et al. , 1997 ; Park et al. ,1997 ; Cunningham and Guest , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription from the main promoter , PsdhC , is thought to be activated by cAMP-CRP and was shown to be activated by reduced FNR and phosphorylated ArcA ( Park et al. 1997 ; Shen and Gunsalus 1997 ; Cunningham and Guest 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17273855" target="_blank">17273855</a>]<br></li>
<li>The third feature is that yﬁD expression is enhanced during growth at acid pH. It is well known that the effects of pH on gene expression overlap with other environmental factors and particularly with oxygen availability ( Cotter et al. , 1990 ; Meng & Bennett , 1992 ; Neely et al. , 1994 ; Slonczewski & Foster , 1996 ; Blankenhorn et al. , 1999 ) and it now appears that yﬁD expression responds to both oxygen starvation and acidic pH via FNR , ArcA and an as yet unknown acid-responsive component .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11932447" target="_blank">11932447</a>]<br></li>
<li>The presence of potential FNR-binding sites suggests that aconitase may be negatively regulated by both FNR and ArcA , like cytochrome o oxidase ( Iuchi , et al. , 1990 ; Cotter et al. , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1541275" target="_blank">1541275</a>]<br></li>
<li>The simplest explanation for this data , based on our knowledge of FNR-mediated regulation of yﬁD expression ( Green et al. , 1998 ; Green & Marshall , 1999 ; Marshall et al. , 2001 ) , is that ArcA relieves the repression mediated by the far upstream FNR dimer by competing for occupation of the ® 93 region of the yﬁD promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11932447" target="_blank">11932447</a>]<br></li>
<li>The relief of ArcA - and FNR-mediated repression accounts for the increased abundance of CAC and aerobic respiratory chain transcripts upon introduction of air ( Table 1 ) ( reviewed by Lynch and Lin ( 29 ) and Guest et al. ( 1 ) ) , and the temporal changes observed here are consistent with the kinetics of FNR inactivation by O2 ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16857675" target="_blank">16857675</a>]<br></li>
<li>Control of signal transmission to the ArcA transcription factor is complex ( Alexeeva et al. , 2000 ; Kwon et al. , 2000 ; Matsubara and Mizuno , 2000 ) , and it is clear that the Arc system and FNR represent two quite different means of monitoring the presence of oxygen .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11251844" target="_blank">11251844</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA , as a two-component regulatory system , and Fnr , as a redox sensor in E. coli , together coordinate the adaptive responses to the availability of oxygen and presence of electron acceptors ( Salmon et al. , 2003 , 2005 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752906" target="_blank">22752906</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , we suggest that the cellular function of ArcZ may be linked to the transcriptional-regulator ArcA , which controls both sdaC and tpx in E. coli ( Kim et al. , 1999 ; Liu and De Wulf , 2004 ) , and regulates STM3216 in Salmo-nella ( Evans , 2008 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19732340" target="_blank">19732340</a>]<br></li>
<li>This pattern is strikingly similar to the physiological control exerted by ArcA ( Lynch and Lin 1996a ; Liu and de Wulf 2004 ; Salmon et al. 2005 ) and it is possible that S affects many of these genes indirectly by stimulating the expression of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results are in contrast to previous works that reported that Fnr represses ndh expression while ArcA induces it ( Meng et al. , 1997 ; Liu and De Wulf , 2004 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>
<li>The transcriptional-regulator hypoxia-inducible factor 1 ( HIF-1 ) mediates changes in genes expression in response to hypoxia in organisms as diverse as humans and nematode worms ( Semenza 2000 ; Shen et al. 2005 ) and it can therefore be considered as the functional homolog of ArcA , although the two proteins do not display significant sequence similarity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707865" target="_blank">20707865</a>]<br></li>
<li>Known regulators involved in the control of acs expression in E. coli are cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) , factor for inversion stimulation ( Fis ) , integration host factor ( IHF ) ( Wolfe 2005 ) and possibly the dual transcriptional-regulator for an-oxic redox control ( ArcA ) ( Covert et al. 2004 ) .

<li>This is in contrast to pervious reports which suggested an independent effect of ArcA and Fnr on cyoA ( Cotter and Gunsalus , 1992 , Tseng et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that Fnr may function as an antiactivator by preventing ArcA activation ( Cotter et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10998176" target="_blank">10998176</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA functions to activate cydAB transcription as oxygen becomes limiting ( Iuchi et al. , 1990 ; Cotter and Gunsalus , 1992 ) , whereas Fnr is required for repression when the oxygen tension is decreased further ( Cotter et al. , 1990 ; 1997 ; Tseng et al. , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10998176" target="_blank">10998176</a>]<br></li>
<li>A unique feature of the cydAB operon is the fact that Fnr repression requires the presence of a functional ArcA protein ( Cotter and Gunsalus , 1992 ; Cotter et al. , 1997 ; Govantes et al. , 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>A particularly intriguing aspect is the absolute requirement of a functional ArcA protein for Fnr regulation of cydAB transcription ( Cotter and Gunsalus , 1992 ; Cotter et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10998176" target="_blank">10998176</a>]<br></li>
<li>The cydA , B operon is known to be controlled by ArcA and Fnr in response to oxygen limitation , and also controlled by Cra by carbon source availability ( Ramseier et al. 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18648770" target="_blank">18648770</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although it has been reported that cyd operon is regulated by the interdependency of Cra , Fnr , and ArcA ( Ramseier et al. 1996 ) , the down-regulation of this operon was due to Cra in the present case since fnr and arcA changed little for the continuous culture at the present aerobic condition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18648770" target="_blank">18648770</a>]<br></li>
<li>This enzyme is encoded by gltA in E. coli , which is under control of ArcA , while its regulation is independent of fnr , crp , and cra gene products ( Park et al. 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18648770" target="_blank">18648770</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also , several studies recently implicated HIF-1 , the functional homolog of ArcA found in metazoans in lifespan regulation in C. elegans ( Chen et al. 2009 ; Mehta et al. 2009 ; Zhang et al. 2009 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707865" target="_blank">20707865</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , the apparent lack of ArcA regulation of fadK transcription was unexpected , given the previous studies that observed the expression of fadK to be induced by oxygen limitation ( Campbell et al. , 2003 ; Morgan-Kiss & Cronan , 2004 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Weak ArcA binding as a result of basal phosphorylation also accounts for the low level of ArcA-dependent regulation observed in aerobiosis ( Cotter and Gunsalus , 1992 ; Cotter et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , the proposed SoxS binding site overlaps both with one of the CRP and one of the ArcA binding sites ( Jeong et al. 2004 ) , suggesting the possibility of complex regulation in response to changes in the redox conditions of the cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18368388" target="_blank">18368388</a>]<br></li>
<li>Loss of ability of an fnr or narXL mutant to reduce nitrate will result in more reduction of the ubiquinone pool , and hence repression of components of the ArcA regulon such as cyoA , and thus Fnr should indirectly activate rather than repress cyoA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21272324" target="_blank">21272324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Loss of active nitrate reduction in the narXL mutant would change the redox state of the ubiquinone/ubiquinol pool and thus indirectly affect their transcription control by ArcA ( 26 , 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>This efficient competition of AroA is not the consequence of non-specific competition due to the other proteins in the crude extract ; the Fur footprint never faded or disappeared in control experiments using , for competition , orude extracts in which ArcA is not overproduced ( Fig. 6b , lanes 18-20 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>Again , the inability of Fur to-bind to DNA pretreated with the crude extract in which ArcA is overproduced was due to a specific effect of ArcA , since Fur bound with the same efficiency to naked DNA and to DNA pretreated with control crude extracts from a strain carrying the expression vector ( Fig. 6a .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA appears to aid in modulating the carbon control , but it is not sufﬁcient to account for the observed catabolite control of either the fumA or fumC promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592392" target="_blank">7592392</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is interesting to speculate that ArcA may be somehow involved in this carbon control , as an arcA mutant exhibits considerably elevated levels of gltA expression in most types of media except for those supplemented with L broth ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>]<br></li>
<li>The highest level of gene expression observed was when the arcA strain was grown in L-broth medium ( c. 30 000 units ) which is about 60-fold greater than that seen for the wildtype strain grown on buffered L-broth glucose rnedium , it appears that ArcA may somehow help to provide tiie observed control in response to medium richness or carbon type ; however , it is not evident if this is a direct or indirect effect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7783618" target="_blank">7783618</a>]<br></li>
<li>It appears that ArcA may contrib-ute to the control observed in response to variations in medium composition ( i.e. , richness or carbon type ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although it appears that ArcA may aid in modulating the carbon control of mdh expression in response to medium richness or carbon type , it is not evident whether this contribution is direct .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592446" target="_blank">7592446</a>]<br></li>

<li>The activation of ArcA under aerobic conditions may be due to the fact that ArcA is a part of a two-component regulatory system that responds to the redox state of the quinone pool ( 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two-component systems generally allow rapid adaptation to environmental change ; thus , as aerobic respiratory conditions become less favourable , the process of ArcA activation through phosphotransfers ( luchi and Lin , 1992a , b ) allows a rapid response to the change in the cellular redox state , preparing the cell for the new conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , profound effects of the absence of ArcA were seen under conditions of oxygen-restricted growth : increased respiration , an altered electron ﬂux distribution over the cytochrome o - and d-terminal oxidases , and a signiﬁcant change in the intracellular redox state were observed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12486057" target="_blank">12486057</a>]<br></li>
<li>This implies that the redox state of the ubiquinone pool is not a major factor in switching ArcA between active and inactive states under the conditions used here , but rather that ArcA activity decreases as aerobiosis increases .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21252224" target="_blank">21252224</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is possible that the different strains and growth conditions used in the two studies might contribute to differences in ArcA activity and ubiquinone/ubiquinol redox profiles .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21252224" target="_blank">21252224</a>]<br></li>
<li>Lack of ArcA causes reduced stationary phase survival under glucose-starvation conditions , which was attributed to the deregulation of cellular redox balance and the uncontrolled drainage of the cells ' endogenous energy reserves ( Nystrom et al. 1996 ) .

<li>The effect of ArcA and Fnr on the TCA cycle genes and the electron transfer chain genes under microaerobic conditions is interesting since it was previously found that ArcA and FNR regulators affect the succinate ﬂuxes as well as the redox potential ( as measured by the NADH/NAD ratio ) , under those + conditions ( Shalel-Levanon et al. , 2005a ) .

<li>The production and uptake of acetate , one of the metabolic byproducts of E. coli under hypoxic conditions , is not predicted to be under the direct control of ArcA according to this and another genome-wide study with the same subject ( Salmon et al. , 2005 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707605" target="_blank">20707605</a>]<br></li>
<li>The requirement of ArcA for survival under these conditions was attributed to the minimization of oxidative damage caused by unchecked respiration and possibly to the regulation of the utilization of endogenous carbon reserves , such as membrane lipids ( Nystrom et al. 1996 ) .

<li>The cyd and cyo operons encoding the quinol oxidases Cyo and Cyd which operate under aerobic or microaerobic conditions are subject to O2 regulation by ArcA and FNR ( Tseng et al. , 1996 ; Fu et al. 1991 ) .

<li>is required for the fully extended lifespan of the lipA and lpdA mutants ArcA is a transcription factor that suppresses the expression of genes involved in respiration and activates genes involved in fermentative metabolism , thus contributing to the adaptation of E. coli to hypoxic conditions ( Iuchi & Lin 1991 ) .

<li>Activated ArcB undergoes a phosphorelay of His292 to Asp576 to His717 , and subsequently activates its cognate transcriptional-regulator ArcA by phosphorylating ArcA at Asp54 to repress genes contributing to aerobic metabolism ( e.g. citrate synthase and isocitrate lyase ) and activates genes necessary for anaerobic metab-olism ( e.g. pyruvate formate lyase and hydrogenase ) [ 23,25,30-34 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19715602" target="_blank">19715602</a>]<br></li>
<li>During anaerobic-growth , the regulator ArcA represses expression of enzymes involved in aerobic metabolism ( 27 ) and activates expression of pyruvate formate-lyase , hydrogenase 1 , and cytochrome d oxidase ( 9 , 25 , 40 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>Summary ArcA is one of several transcription factors required for optimal anaerobic induction of the pyruvate formate-lyase ipff ) operon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the function of the PDH complex is adopted by pyruvate formate-lyase ( PFL ) under anaerobic conditions , it was anticipated that the two operons might exhibit reciprocal responses to the redox-responsive regulators , ArcA and FNR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8057842" target="_blank">8057842</a>]<br></li>
<li>Deletion of ArcA neither signiﬁcantly altered the in vivo activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and pyruvate formate lyase nor signiﬁcantly affected catabo-lism under fully aerobic and fully anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12486057" target="_blank">12486057</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of oxygen , ArcA is bound to its cognate sites acting to repress transcription of the fad regulon genes , even under non-inducing conditions ( without fatty acids ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it is not surprising that ArcA , which is active under conditions of oxygen limitation , is an activator of moe operon transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it appears that ArcA , either directly or indirectly , negatively regulates the transcription of the anaerobic b-oxidation pathway genes fadJ and fadI in the absence of oxygen .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA regulates fumA and fumC at 0 % to 21 % oxygen concentration , and strongly represses the genes at 0 -- 4 % .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752906" target="_blank">22752906</a>]<br></li>
<li>The model presented here is supported by the following evidence : ( i ) FadR repression coincides with ArcA repression for the fatty acid metabolism under anaerobic conditions ; ( ii ) ArcA-P is a DNA-binding protein speciﬁc to the upstream of fad regulon genes involved in fatty acid metabolism of E. coli ; ( iii ) under anaerobic conditions , transcription of fad regulon genes is increased upon the inactivation of ArcA , whereas , under aerobic conditions , transcription of those genes is not affected by the inactivation of ArcA ; ( iv ) the fadR deletion affects both aerobic and anaerobic transcription of fad regulon genes ; and ( v ) under anaerobic conditions , the transcript levels of fad regulon genes are synergistically increased upon the deletion of both arcA and fadR .

<li>Thus , ndh expression was rapidly and strongly enhanced in the anaerobic to aerobic transition , which could be explained by ArcA , FNR and PdhR all repressing ndh expression under the initial anaerobic conditions followed by rapid de-repression upon introduction of oxygen , which inactivates ArcA and FNR , and causes pyruvate accumulation , by inhibition of pyruvate for-mate-lyase [ 20 ] , to inactivate PdhR .

<li>This led us to ask how the H-NS mediated repression is replaced by the ArcA dependent activation during the transition of the facultative bacterium E. coli from its aerobic to anaerobic-growth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two possibilities may explain the transition from H-NS mediated repression to ArcA mediated activation of gadE-mdtEF during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic-growth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>FIGURE 6  ArcA antagonizes the H-NS mediated repression of gadE under anaerobic-growth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>We found that unlike the regulatory patterns occurred during aerobic acid stresses , anaerobic activation of the gadE-mdtEF operon is primarily mediated by ArcA through its antagonization of the H-NS mediated repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , anaerobic activation of gadE-mdtEF through antagonizing the H-NS mediated repression by ArcA provides a regulatory model that is relevant to the dynamic lifestyle of the facultative bacterium E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Together these results conﬁrmed that ArcA and MnmE are primarily responsible for the anaerobic activation of mdtEF .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the observed MnmE mediated anaerobic activation of gadE-mdtEF was not due to its potential effects on ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>If MnmE affects either the production or phosphorylation of ArcA ( which affects the regulatory activity of ArcA ) , mnmE should cause full or partial de-repression of these two promoters under anaerobic condition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alternatively , the residual anaerobic repression by nitrate and the repression by fumarate could be an indirect effect of ArcA , since the level of active ArcA is dependent on the respiratory state of the cell .

<li>Furthermore , under aerobic conditions , ArcA ( D54E ) repression of P1icdA was increased compared to that of wt ArcA for all binding sites tested ( Fig. 5B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25161193" target="_blank">25161193</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , this regulatory effect of the ArcA/ArcB two-component system seemed to be indirect , since deletion of the four proximal bases ( TGTT ) of the putative ArcA binding site had no effect on hcaR repression under anaerobic-growth conditions ( Fig. 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15808934" target="_blank">15808934</a>]<br></li>
<li>How ArcA binding to each DR element contributes to icdA repression was determined by measuring - galactosidase activity produced from P1icdA-lacZ transcriptional fusions containing the GT-to-CA ( 5 = - TGTTA-3 = to 5 = - TCATA-3 =) mutations within each DR element under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25161193" target="_blank">25161193</a>]<br></li>
<li>Assuming that these nucleotide changes simply improve DNA binding afﬁn-ity , the enhanced anaerobic repression suggests that the three DRs of wt icdA are not completely occupied by ArcA under our standard anaerobic-growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25161193" target="_blank">25161193</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , H-NS can still repress the cydAB P4 promoter ( albeit weakly ) in an arcA Dfnr background 1 under anaerobic conditions ( Fig. 6 ) , and preliminary results suggest that ArcA and H-NS can simultaneously bind the ArcA-II region in vitro ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>One possibility is that H-NS is inactive under anaerobic conditions and it disassembles from the gadE promoter , allowing ArcA which is active under this condition to-bind the promoter of gadE and initiate gene transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alternatively , under anaerobic conditions H-NS can still bind to the gadE promoter , however , its binding is antagonized by the activated ArcA , resulting in the recruitment of RNAP and transcript initiation of the operon under this condition .

<li>ArcA and AppY Antagonize IscR Repression of Hydrogenase-1 Expression under Anaerobic Conditions , Revealing a Novel Mode O2 Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli of A. D. Nesbit , * A. S. Fleischhacker , S. J. Teter , and P. J. Kiley Department of Biomolecular Chemistry , University of Wisconsin , Madison , Wisconsin , USA Transcription of the Escherichia coli hydrogenase-1 operon ( hyaABCDEF ) is increased by the transcription factors ArcA and AppY under anaerobic-growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA and AppY activated transcription of the cyx-appA operon during entry into stationary phase and under anaerobic-growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>The anaerobic transcription of the hydrogenase 1 operon is activated by ArcA and AppY , which seem to act independently .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL and NarP appear to be responsible for repression of hya expression in response to nitrate ( 5 , 31 ) , whereas the anaerobic transcription factors ArcA and AppY are required for the increased expression of the hya operon in response to anaerobiosis ( 5 , 31 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our data indicate that the decrease in expression upon elimination of ArcA or AppY is not due to activation by either transcription factor , but , rather , to repression by IscR in the absence of ArcA and/or AppY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the decreased expression in strains lacking ArcA and/or AppY under anaerobic conditions does not appear to result from a defect in activation by ArcA or AppY but , rather , from unmasking IscR repression in the absence of these other transcription factors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the role of ArcA as an anaerobic antirepressor of IscR at PhyaA raises the question of whether the decreased expression of other promoters in strains lacking ArcA is due to the loss of ArcA activation or to the unmasking of repression by another transcription factor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>As IscR protected a region of the hyaA promoter that overlaps the − 35 promoter element and site ( s ) where an activator may bind , one mechanism to explain the lack of IscR repression of the hyaA and hybO promoters under anaerobic conditions would be the occlusion of IscR binding by anaerobic regulators ( ArcA , AppY or FNR ) and/or RNA polymerase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16677314" target="_blank">16677314</a>]<br></li>
<li>More recently , another transcription factor , IscR , has been shown to directly repress the hyaA promoter ( PhyaA ) but only under aerobic conditions when ArcA and AppY are not active ( 14 , 28 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , downregulation of IscR levels under anaerobic conditions appears to be important for proper regulation of PhyaA , such that IscR competition with ArcA and AppY for PhyaA binding is maintained at a low level , keeping PhyaA from being repressed anaerobically .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test whether increasing the concentration of IscR could overcome antirepression by ArcA and AppY , we varied the levels of both the wild-type and a clusterless mutant of IscR and monitored the expression of the hya promoter under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>hyaA In this study , we examined the roles of IscR , ArcA , and AppY in regulating the expression of the hyaA promoter under aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA , AppY , and IscR act combinatorially to control hyaA promoter expression levels under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , elimination of all three transcription factors ( IscR , AppY , and ArcA ) resulted in an unexpectedly high level of expression under anaerobic conditions , which was slightly greater than the level of expression in the parent strain ( Fig. 1A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consistent with the notion that PhyaA expression is regulated by IscR repression aerobically and by ArcA and AppY antirepression of IscR anaerobically , PhyaA-lacZ expression levels in the absence of any transcription factors were similar under anaerobic and aerobic conditions ( Fig. 1A and C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>In sum , a combination of ArcA and AppY antirepression of IscR function , lower levels of IscR , and weak repression by [ 2Fe-2S ] - IscR leads to increased PhyaA expression under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here , we report that ArcA and AppY increase PhyaA expression under anaerobic conditions by antagonizing IscR binding at PhyaA , since IscR repression is observed when either ArcA or AppY is eliminated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , ArcA repression is not observed when all three transcription factors are present , suggesting that the major effect of ArcA under anaerobic conditions is to increase expression of PhyaA by preventing IscR repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our studies revealed that IscR repressor function is diminished under anaerobic conditions because of antirepression by ArcA and AppY , decreased IscR levels , and decreased repressor function of [ 2Fe-2S ] - IscR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Antirepression by the anaerobic transcription factors ArcA and AppY , in addition to a combination of decreased levels of wild-type IscR and the weak repressing function of [ 2Fe-2S ] - IscR , resulted in the lack of repression by IscR under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>A further , but small , increase in repression of PhyaA was observed with IscRC92A when ArcA and AppY were eliminated ( Fig. 3C ) , indicating that the ability of apo-IscR to repress PhyaA under anaerobic conditions is largely indifferent to the presence of ArcA and AppY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>RESULTS AppY and ArcA prevent IscR repression of the hyaA promoter under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Despite the fact that we observed more repression of the hyaA promoter with increasing levels of IscR , the extent of PhyaA repression under anaerobic conditions was never as great as that measured under aerobic conditions , even in the absence of AppY and ArcA ( Fig. 1 and 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data also show that both AppY and ArcA must be present to prevent IscR repression of PhyaA under anaerobic conditions , since loss of either transcription factor is sufﬁcient to permit repression by IscR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>We found that under anaerobic conditions two transcription factors , ArcA and AppY , work together to overcome the repression of PhyaA by IscR that occurs under aerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since ArcA competes with IscR for binding to PhyaA , we examined whether the proposed antirepression mechanism is dependent on the low IscR protein levels observed under anaerobic conditions compared to levels observed under aerobic conditions ( 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ﬁnding that PhyaA was repressed by IscR under aerobic conditions was surprising since activation of PhyaA under anaerobic conditions by ArcA and AppY would make an aerobic repressor unnecessary .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>The lack of repression of PhyaA under anaerobic conditions appears to be linked to the lower anaerobic levels of IscR ( 10-fold less than aerobic protein levels [ 13 ] ) since artiﬁcially increasing the levels of wild-type IscR to those found under aerobic conditions resulted in increased repression of PhyaA by IscR , even in the presence of ArcA and AppY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>These disparate observations with regard to survival probably reflect the requirement for ArcA when fermentation is the predominant means of energy generation ( as in glucose minimal medium ) , but not under conditions where respiration is the major source of energy ( as in LB ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707605" target="_blank">20707605</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consistent with our hypothesis , we observed activation of the ArcA regulator under oxic conditions and consequent activation of fermentative metabolism during aerobic-growth , while the regulatory action of the FNR regulator remained similar to that for the wild type .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>A shift from UQs to MQs resulted in activation of the ArcA regulator under oxic and anoxic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>We observed signiﬁcant downregulation of the sdhABCD ( succinate dehydrogenase ) and frdABCD operons , known to be repressed by ArcA , under oxic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since cytochrome d is needed to scavenge 02 under microaerobic conditions , it makes biological sense that when 02 is deficient cyd should be activated by ArcA , instead of being repressed by the regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1851949" target="_blank">1851949</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is consistent with the fact that ArcA represses cytochrome bo oxidase synthesis under microaerobic conditions ( 9 , 23 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12486057" target="_blank">12486057</a>]<br></li>
<li>As ArcA efficiently competes with RssB for phosphorylation by ArcB ( especially under conditions where autophosphorylation of ArcB is reduced as mentioned above ) , increased ArcA levels may result in further reduced levels of phosphorylated RssB , and consequently , further reduced S proteolysis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data suggest that in vivo repression by ArcA in the absence of ArcB is not exerted by nonphosphorylated ArcA , but that under these conditions , ArcA is still phosphorylated , most likely from acetyl phosphate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Namely , ArcA may be phosphorylated by non-cognate HK or acetyl phosphate under these conditions ( Fig. 1C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12366850" target="_blank">12366850</a>]<br></li>
<li>By phosphorylation ( anoxic conditions ) , ArcA is converted to the active state ( ArcA-phosphate , ArcA-P ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8588737" target="_blank">8588737</a>]<br></li>
<li>Matsushika and Mizuno previously reported that ArcB can also phosphorylate ArcA directly through His292 under aerobic conditions [ 45 ] , however , its physiological relevance to E. coli has not been reported .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19715602" target="_blank">19715602</a>]<br></li>
<li>For this purpose , both strains were cultured anaerobically because only under these conditions does ArcB phosphorylate ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14711822" target="_blank">14711822</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under such conditions , for a given time period the amount of ArcA phosphorylated was proportional to the concentration of ` ArcB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under oxic conditions , phosphorylated ArcA activates numerous operons involved in fermentative metabolism ( 6 , 33 ) and represses operons involved in respiratory metabolism ( 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is not known if ArcA is phosphorylated under aerobic conditions or if unphosphorylated ArcA has any function .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19715602" target="_blank">19715602</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because ArcA is presumed to be inactive under aerobic conditions ( 5 , 6 , 31 ) , we did not perform experiments comparing arcA genotypes under aerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our results on the role of ArcAB in ROS resistance suggest that ArcAB can be activated by novel signals other than reduced quinones and anaerobic conditions , and the activation is independent of phosphorylation at Asp54 of ArcA as demonstrated under anaerobic conditions [ 41,42,46 ] , since phosphorylation-defective ArcA expressed from a plasmid fully complemented an arcA mutant E. coli for its susceptibility to H2O2 ( Figure 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19715602" target="_blank">19715602</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under anaerobic conditions , the activity of the response-regulator ArcA is increased through phosphorylation by the sensor kinase ArcB ( 1 ) , while the activity of AppY is presumably increased by changes in appY transcription ( 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under these conditions , the anaeroresponsive ArcB / ArcA system , the osmoresponsive EnvZ/OmpR system and the response-regulator UvrY showed the most drastic changes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12366850" target="_blank">12366850</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under anoxic or environmentally reducing conditions , the sensor kinase ( ArcB ) is stimulated to autophosphorylate at the expense of ATP and subsequently transphosphorylates the response-regulator ( ArcA ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylation at Asp54 is dispensable for H2O2 resistance mediated by ArcA Under anaerobic conditions , ArcB is activated by reduced quinones , undergoes auto-phosphorylation , and transfers its phosphorylation to ArcA [ 25,32,41-43 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19715602" target="_blank">19715602</a>]<br></li>
<li>Most of the anaerobic induction in the wild type is mediated by the ArcA response-regulator ( 9 ) , which is activated via phosphorylation by the ArcB sensor under conditions of reduced respiration ( 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8655536" target="_blank">8655536</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this model , the signal allowing the switch from one ` mode ' to another would be the state of ArcA phosphorylation , which is itself driven by ArcB sensing of aerobic or anaerobic conditions .

<li>Under anaerobic or microaerobic conditions , ArcB undergoes autophosphorylation and then catalyzes the transphosphorylation of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14711822" target="_blank">14711822</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under anaerobic conditions , ArcB autophosphorylates and transphosphorylates ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16980446" target="_blank">16980446</a>]<br></li>
<li>As O2 levels decrease , the proportion of phosphorylated ArcA increases accordingly , with maximal phosphorylation occurring under anaerobic conditions ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25161193" target="_blank">25161193</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the data obtained show that the proportion of phosphorylated ArcA correlated well with the inferred ArcA activity profile ( Fig. 3A , compare closed diamonds and closed squares ) , with maximum phosphorylation and activity at 0 % aerobiosis , consistent with the observation that ArcB-mediated phosphorylation of ArcA is maximal under anaerobic conditions ( 51 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21252224" target="_blank">21252224</a>]<br></li>
<li>The net activity of ArcB as a kinase for ArcA is expected to progressively increase during transition from aerobic to anaerobic-growth , and the concentration of the phosphorylated form of the ArcA ( ArcA-P ) is therefore predicted to reach peak levels in anoxic cells .

<li>The newly identified transmitter module and anaerobic regulation by ArcB As mentioned above , ArcB controls the anaerobic repression of several operons by phosphorylating its cognate response-regulator , ArcA ( Drury and Buxton , 1985 ) .

<li>The lack of the ArcA regulator did not result in signiﬁcant differences in cat-abolic efﬁciency under fully aerobic or fully anaerobic conditions , nor in the lower microaerobic range .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12486057" target="_blank">12486057</a>]<br></li>

<li>Under anaerobic conditions , it has been suggested that ArcA represses the b-oxidation pathway , but there is little direct evidence regarding this regulation ( Lin & Iuchi , 1991 ; Covert et al. , 2004 ) .

<li>tpx has been reported to be negatively regulated by ArcA ( Kim et al , 1999 ) ; as regulation by ArcZ is also negative , this regulatory circuit would suggest interlocking mechanisms for keeping tpx expression relatively low under most conditions ; it would be transcriptionally repressed under anaerobic-growth conditions by ArcA , and translationally repressed under aerobic conditions by ArcZ .

<li>In addition to the regulation by FadR and ArcA under aerobic and anaerobic conditions , many fad genes are positively regulated by the Crp regulatory protein in response to chan-ging cyclic AMP levels ( Clark & Cronan , 1996 ; Pauli et al. , 1974 ) .

<li>Gene expression proﬁles of deletion mutants ( DarcA , DfadR and DarcA/DfadR ) indicated that ( i ) ArcA is a major transcription factor for the transcriptional regulation of fatty acid metabolism in the absence of oxygen , and ( ii ) ArcA and FadR cooperatively regulate the fad regulon under anaerobic conditions .

<li>Cho and coworkers [ 12 ] initially used quantitative RT-PCR to assay regulation of fadL and fadD by FadR and ArcA under anaerobic conditions and reported that deletion of either arcA , fadR alone , or both arcA and fadR resulted in increased fadL expression by 34 - , 4 - or 69-fold , respectively , whereas fadD transcription increased 69 - , 4.5 - , and 84-fold .

<li>However , our data differed from those of Cho and coworkers in the effects reported on FadR regulation of fadL transcription under anaerobic conditions when ArcA is functional ( we see no effect versus their reported 4-fold increase ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23029459" target="_blank">23029459</a>]<br></li>
<li>Direct positive and negative regulation of many genes has been shown , generally with the biggest effect of ArcA seen under anaerobic conditions when ArcB is actively phosphorylating ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>We therefore investigated the role that ArcA may play in the negative regulation of fadJ , fadI and fadK under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA has no signiﬁcant role in dcuB regulation , although it appears that a factor other than FNR also contributes to anaerobic induction of dcuB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852003" target="_blank">9852003</a>]<br></li>
<li>In looking at the top 500 genes from each group , 48 genes were identified as being subject solely to ArcA regulation and 57 solely to FNR regulation under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , the 378 genes in the ArcA grouping and the 369 genes in the FNR grouping that do not show regulation by oxygen , but that are regulated by each of these proteins ( or co-regulated ) under anaerobic conditions , suggest that these two proteins may also be important for adaptation to the anaerobic environment .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it seems that ArcA still increases its level of activity slightly in the ECOM4LA aerobic-anaerobic shift .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the change in composition of the quinone pool ( Fig. 4C ) leads to activation of ArcA and subsequent activation of fermentative metabolism during aerobic and anaerobic-growth of the ECOM4LA cell line .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>The principle function of ArcA appears to be as an anaerobic repressor of genes encoding enzymes functional in aerobic metabolism ( 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1592804" target="_blank">1592804</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylated ArcA directly regulates many genes , including those encoding aerobic or anaerobic respiratory enzymes , and typically functions as a repressor ( 19 , 32 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylated ArcA ( ArcA-P ) generally behaves as an anaerobic repressor , negatively controlling aerobic respiration although some genes are activated by ArcA-P [ 15 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8824175" target="_blank">8824175</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA appears to repress mdh transcription under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions , as has also been shown for the gltA and sdhCDAB TCA genes ( 16 , 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592446" target="_blank">7592446</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under anaerobic conditions ArcA mostly negatively regulates genes involved in the TCA cycle and electron transport [ 26-28 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19715602" target="_blank">19715602</a>]<br></li>
<li>The secondary promoter Plpd is under the control of ArcA , which is the global repressor of TCA cycle genes under anaerobic conditions ( 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17513468" target="_blank">17513468</a>]<br></li>
<li>Salmonella species synthesize cobalamin de novo only under anaerobic-growth conditions , and the cobalamin synthetic genes are induced by propanediol during both aerobic ( requiring cyclic AMP [ cAMP ] receptor protein-cAMP complex [ CRP-cAMP ] ) and anaerobic ( requiring CRP-cAMP and/or the ArcA protein ) growth conditions ( 1 , 7 , 12 , 18 , 51 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592411" target="_blank">7592411</a>]<br></li>
<li>When activated anaerobically by the membrane sensor protein ArcB , ArcA typically represses a number of genes involved in aerobic metabolism [ 18 ] and activates genes necessary for anaerobic-growth [ 9,22 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18683632" target="_blank">18683632</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA , which is the regulatory protein of a two-component system , controls-the-activity of many E. coli genes which are repressed under anaerobic conditions ( reviewed in reference 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626294" target="_blank">8626294</a>]<br></li>
<li>These operons were also repressed signiﬁcantly under anoxic conditions , indicating activity of ArcA during anaerobic-growth consistent with that for WT E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of arcZ is repressed by the aerobic/anaerobic-sensing ArcA -- ArcB two-component system under anaerobic conditions and adds translational regulation to the ArcA -- ArcB regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under anaerobic conditions , ArcA , the response-regulator of the two-component ArcA-ArcB system , represses many genes for aerobic functions and activates transcription of some other genes ( 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923108" target="_blank">12923108</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcZ is negatively regulated by the ArcB/ArcA two-component system ; ArcA-P is formed under anaerobic-growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23659637" target="_blank">23659637</a>]<br></li>
<li>In anaerobic-growth conditions , RpoS was not detect-able in exponential phase , even in the absence of ArcA ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) , and the fusion was too low to measure .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recently , Liu and De Wulf ( 22 ) identified 234 ORFs as being repressed by ArcA under anaerobic conditions in a microarraybased study .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the gatZYABC operon , negatively controlled by CsgD ( 10 ) ( Table 2 ) is repressed by ArcA in anaerobic conditions ( 60 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17873038" target="_blank">17873038</a>]<br></li>
<li>In those studies , it was suggested that ArcA represses fadK transcription under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Induction was dependent on the transcriptional-regulator ArcA , with a second transcriptional-regulator , FNR , playing a negative role speciﬁcally under anaerobic conditions ( S. Darie and R. P. Gunsalus , J. Bacteriol .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8550494" target="_blank">8550494</a>]<br></li>
<li>These pattems were essentiaiiy the same under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and they suggest that ArcA represses P/pa but not Ppat , or Pace - FNR appeared to activate Pp ^ h and repress P ^ ce under anaerobic conditions , but these obsen/ations are difficult to interpret since the effects of the fnr mutation were B Fig. 7 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8057842" target="_blank">8057842</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA is the major regulator of aerobic metabolism and represses the genes of aerobic metabolism under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9230919" target="_blank">9230919</a>]<br></li>
<li>FNR and ArcA are involved in sensing the redox status of the cell to regulate genes involved in respiration under aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12582243" target="_blank">12582243</a>]<br></li>
<li>This further supports our previous suggestion ( 1 ) that the FNR , Lrp , and now ArcA regulons reveal overlapping functions under aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the slight increase in cydAB transcripts observed under anaerobic-growth conditions in the microarray data can be explained by ArcA activation , and the increase in cydAB transcripts in the absence of FNR is due to the loss of FNR repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659690" target="_blank">15659690</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the anaerobic repression was mediated by ArcA , as witnessed by the fivefold anaerobic de-repression ( and up to twofold aerobic derepression ) in an arcA mutant ( Table 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9720032" target="_blank">9720032</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of lpdA gene has been shown to be mediated by the repression of ArcA under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>

<li>The anaerobic repression of dctA by ArcA limits the function of DctA to aerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10482502" target="_blank">10482502</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA repression under anaerobic conditions is always greater than that under aerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our ﬁndings demonstrating that ArcA activates the expression of the operon through antagonizing the H-NS mediated repression probably provide a common model that underlies the dynamic and coordinated regulation of gadE-mdtEF in response to different environmental signals .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>The acid resistant island including the gadE-mdtEF operon indeed is one of the acquired gene clusters in E. coli with different GC content from the rest of E. coli genome ; Third , the interplay between the H-NS mediated repression and ArcA mediated antagonizing of the repression is also observed in the case of another gene cydAB which is also involved in adapting E. coli to the microaerobic and anaerobic-growth ( Govantes et al. , 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the three-component arcB/cpxA/arcA system , it would appear that the behaviour of ArcA depends on whether the signal is transmitted by ArcB or CpxA , since mutations in arcB release anaerobic enzyme repression and cause dye sensitivity but do not prevent the synthesis of F pilus , and mutations in cpxA prevent the expression of F-plasmid function but do not impair the other two functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2201868" target="_blank">2201868</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , these data strongly suggested that arcZ expression was repressed , directly or indirectly , by the ArcA / ArcB two-component system , and that the plasmids that increase arcZ -- lacZ expression are titrating ArcA from the arcZ promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>Induction of the expression of arcB from the PBAD promoter with 0.2 % arabinose repressed the arcZ fusion in an arcA-dependent manner on MacConkey lactose plates , suggesting that increased ArcB activates ArcA repression ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>Ubiquinone inhibits the kinase activity of ArcB ( 26 , 27 ) and hence determines the phosphorylation state of ArcA and its ability to regulate gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>As the redox state of the respiratory chain depends on the concentration of the terminal electron acceptor , the activity of the ArcB -- ArcA system is controlled by oxygen supply and is therefore crucially involved in the control of gene expression during transition to anaerobic conditions ( Lynch and Lin 1996a ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , the membrane-bound sensor of respiratory activity and anaerobic metabolism ArcB [ 28 -- 30 ] mediates changes in gene expression through its cognate regulator ArcA when the supply of oxygen is insufficient to fully penetrate the cytoplasm and inactivate the direct oxygen sensor FNR [ 31,32 ] .

<li>Negative regulation of uvrA gene expression by ArcA/ArcB two-component system To clarify the effect of ArcA on uvrA gene expression , E. coli MYuvrA containing pBADarcA was cultured in the presence or absence of arabinose , and uvrA gene expression was measured as b-galactosidase activity .

<li>These results suggest that the response-regulator ArcA regulates expression of enzyme IICBGlc mediating the first step of glucose metabolism in response to the redox conditions of growth in E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA has been well characterized as the response-regulator of the two-component sensory system regulating gene expression in response to the redox conditions of growth in E. coli ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>In Escherichia coli , gene expression in response to changing respiratory conditions of growth is partially mediated by the Arc two-component signal transduction system ( 1 -- 6 ) , which comprises the transmembrane ArcB sensor kinase and its cytosolic cognate response-regulator ArcA ( 7 , 8 ) .

<li>Differential Gene Expression in the Absence of Oxygen and in the Presence and Absence of the ArcA Global Regulatory Protein A comparison of the gene expression levels between cells grown in the absence of oxygen and in the presence or absence of ArcA revealed 2264 genes that exhibited expression levels above the background for all replicates of Experiments 2 and 3 ( O2 , ArcA versus O2 , ArcA ) ( Fig. 1 ) .

<li>Expression Pattern II : Increased Expression during Anaerobiosis and Decreased Expression in an ArcA Strain -- Transcription of the 57 genes of expression pattern II ( Table II ) was both induced in the absence of oxygen and positively regulated by ArcA .

<li>It is uncertain whether the minor effects of ArcA on dcuA and dcuB expression reﬂect a metabolic consequence of deregulation of the arcA regulon or a direct interaction of the dcuA and dcuB genes with the ArcA protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852003" target="_blank">9852003</a>]<br></li>
<li>It was revealed that in microaerobiosis activation of ArcB and the subsequent phosphorelay to its response-regulator ArcA are required for the full expression of the psp genes [ 25 , 26 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21259006" target="_blank">21259006</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the absence of ArcA led to a diminished response of expression onset to external pH and the loss of elevated expression at an acidic external pH. The fermentation end product formate slightly altered hya expression levels but was not required for hya to respond to external pH. In contrast to hya expression , the onset of hyb operon expression , encoding uptake hydrogenase isoenzyme 2 , was constitutive with respect to external pH. However , external pH did affect hyb expression levels , which , in contrast to hya , were maximal in alkaline rather than acidic medium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464194" target="_blank">10464194</a>]<br></li>
<li>The immediate response to anaerobiosis of the hya operon could be due to activation of the hya promoter by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071220" target="_blank">8071220</a>]<br></li>
<li>The aceBAK operon is under negative regulation by IclR , FadR ( indirectly by regulation of the iclR expression ( 62 ) , Crp ( 52 ) , and ArcA ( 63 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17426033" target="_blank">17426033</a>]<br></li>
<li>The pfl operon is one of only a few whose expression is regulated positively in response to anaerobiosis by ArcA .

<li>The majority of other ArcA or FNR regulated genes studied so far are either repressed anaerobically by ArcA or activated anaerobically by FNR , although three examples are known whose expression is repressed by FNR anaerobically ( 14 , 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1592804" target="_blank">1592804</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression and transport data are consistent with each other insofar as Dcu transport activity and the combined dcuA-and dcuB-lacZ activities are activated anaerobically by FNR , repressed anaerobically in the presence of nitrate by NarL , increased by fumarate or succinate , and weakly affected by ArcA ( 8 , 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852003" target="_blank">9852003</a>]<br></li>
<li>The lacZ fusion data revealed that expression of ptsG is negatively regulated by ArcA , and this effect is independent of Mlc ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>The elevated level of hemA expression seen in the absence of added 8-ALA somehow requires the ArcA protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071201" target="_blank">8071201</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that the presence of a null mutation in arcA leads to an increase in ptsG expression regardless of Mlc suggests that ArcA should be the direct repressor of ptsG .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fnr mutant strain exhibited only a slight reduction in hyb expression , while the loss of ArcA function surprisingly led to an approximate 60 % increase in expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>
<li>The aerobic expression was seemingly poised in the working range of ArcA because the activity was enhanced 1-25-fold in the a r c A deletion strain but repressed 2-fold in the multicopy arcA host ( Fig. 6b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regulation of acnA gene expression by CRP , ArcA and FNR The 0-galactosidase activity expressed from a single-copy A.acnA-lacZ fusion prophage in the crp ' parental strain was reduced 3-5-foldin the crp deletion strain but restored by the presence of a multicopy crp + plasmid ( Fig. 5a ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>Without ArcA , hya expression appeared to respond primarily to changes in growth rate and not external pH. ArcA regulates gene expression in response to changes in the respiratory state of the cell ( 16 ) and may be activated by the accompanying decline in Dp ( 8 , 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464194" target="_blank">10464194</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , except in the case of growth on acetate , either ArcA must exist in a partly activated state ( e.g. , a phosphorylated form ) which can bind to the DNA , or , alternatively , the nonphosphorylated form of ArcA must be able to effectively bind DNA and regulate gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Anaerobic induction of hya expression was dependent on the ArcA and AppY regulators , which conﬁrms earlier observations by other authors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>
<li>We have recently shown that the induction of AppY-responsive operons by different environmental stimuli is partly mediated by an increase in the level of expression of the appY gene and that the ArcA respiration response-regulator is involved in induction by anaerobiosis and growth-phase ( 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8655536" target="_blank">8655536</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nuoE gene also appeared to be subject to FNR regulation in our previous work ( 1 ) , but the effect of FNR may be indirect as a consequence of its role in regulating ArcA expression ( 39 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to regulation by ArcA and FNR , ndh expression is repressed by the pyruvate-responsive TF PdhR ; repression is relieved by pyruvate [ 40 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>This would de-repress ndh expression to oppose ArcA and FNR-mediated repression , maintaining relatively constant ndh expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>This pattern of expression results from ArcA activation as O2 becomes limited , while FNR represses cydAB as O2 is depleted .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659690" target="_blank">15659690</a>]<br></li>

<li>Nevertheless , it is clear that FNR and ArcA work together to coordinate gene expression in response to the availability of oxygen ( 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21252224" target="_blank">21252224</a>]<br></li>

<li>Transcription of ndh is repressed by FNR [ 38 ] and gene expression profiling suggests that it is activated by ArcA [ 39 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results indicate that the anaerobic repression of dctA is mediated primarily by ArcA , with a minor contribution from FNR that is likely to be related to the activation of arcA expression by FNR ( 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10482502" target="_blank">10482502</a>]<br></li>
<li>Compared to the lpd promoter , there was no ArcA - or FNR-dependent anaerobic repression , no glucose repression , nor any other common feature that could provide a mechanism for co-regulating sucABCD and l p d A expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9720032" target="_blank">9720032</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here it has been shown that the anaerobic transcription factor FNR is the major activator of yﬁD expression , but that the extent of FNR-mediated activation can be modulated by the indirect oxygen sensor ArcA and the pyruvate sensor PdhR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11932447" target="_blank">11932447</a>]<br></li>
<li>Despite the activation of the repressors ArcA and FNR by the withdrawal of oxygen in the aerobic -- anaerobic transition , ndh expression did not decrease ( figure 6b ) , consistent with the microarray data ( figure 4c ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>3474 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ArcA and FNR are required for complete anaerobic pfl operon expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1592804" target="_blank">1592804</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , this does not seem to be the case because FNR and ArcA are both essential for the anaerobic activation of pfl expression ( Sawers an 00 M. A. Quail .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8057842" target="_blank">8057842</a>]<br></li>
<li>Anaerobic induction of each of these promoters requires FNR and ArcA ( 35 ) , and anaerobic expression is further increased by growth in media containing pyruvate ( 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8376324" target="_blank">8376324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also , the absence of a fumB transcript in the aerobic sample is consistent with previous studies showing anaerobic induction of fumB-lacZ fusions of up to 5-fold and 3 - to 10-fold reductions in anaerobic expression in the absence of FNR and/or ArcA ( 41 , 44 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852003" target="_blank">9852003</a>]<br></li>
<li>Se-cond , multiple copies of the fnr ' gene lowered aerobic and anaerobic expression to 68 % and 58 % of the respective parental levels , suggesting that in the absence of ArcA , amplified FNR can interact negatively at the acnB promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previous transcriptional fusion studies have reported a 3-fold increase in the expression level of this gene during aerobic-growth , and this decreased expression during anaerobiosis is independent of FNR , as well as ArcA ( 38 ) .

<li>Mean gene expression data ( fold change ) , acquired from the WT and ECOM4LA strains grown in triplicate , for all genes that are known to be regulated by the anaerobic regulator FNR or ArcA according to RegulonDB were compared to the reported function of the regulator ( activator or repressor ) .

<li>To investigate the effects of ArcA , RpoS , and FNR on dctA expression , arcA , rpoS , and fnr deletions were transferred from the respective donor strains , ECL585 , RH90 , and JRG1728 , by P1vir-mediated transduction , to the dctA-lacZ fusion strain , JRG3351 , generating strains JRG4011 , SCA345 , and JRG4013 , respectively ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10482502" target="_blank">10482502</a>]<br></li>
<li>Deletion of arcA had no signiﬁcant effect on FNR-mediated expression from FF-41 .5 at both pH 7 ± 2 and pH 6 ± 3 , and thus the ArcAmediated enhancement of yﬁD expression ( Table 2 ) is probably mediated by ArcA competing with FNR for occupancy of the ® 93 region of the yﬁD promoter , where FNR can act negatively and ArcA positively , and that the positive effects of ArcA are magniﬁed by the presence of arcA in multiple copies .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11932447" target="_blank">11932447</a>]<br></li>
<li>Loss of FadR increased fadH expression 7 - to 8-fold , in general agreement with the data obtained by the RT-qPCR assay ( Fig. 4 ) , whereas loss of ArcA increased expression 4 - to 5-fold ( Fig. 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20622065" target="_blank">20622065</a>]<br></li>
<li>As a result , uvrA expression was remarkably repressed by induction of ArcA with arabinose ( Fig. 1A ) , but in the arcA and arcB-defective strains , it increased more than in the wild-type strain ( Fig. 1B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140472" target="_blank">16140472</a>]<br></li>
<li>In anaerobiosis , fur and arc mutations have a synergistic effect on sodA expression , showing that either Fur or ArcA alone almost completely represses sodA ( Tardat and Touati , 1991 ) , The relative importance of these two repressors in sodA regulation when both are present and active in the cell is still unknown .

<li>1991 ) , Fur couples sodA expression to the intraceilular iron concentration and ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>In aerobiosis , ArcA repression of sodA is totally relieved , but Fur can still partially block sodA transcription , modulating its expression in response to the iron concentration of the environment .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the PTS plays important roles in carbohydrate metabolism , we thought that ArcA might be involved in the regulation of PTS expression in response to the cellular redox status .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA ( or SfrA , for sex factor regulation ) is also required for expression of the tra ( DNA transfer ) genes of the F plasmid .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon phosphorylation , ArcA binds extensively across the ge-nome , regulating the expression of ~ 100 operons and acting predominantly as a global repressor of nonfermentative carbon oxidation pathways ( 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25161193" target="_blank">25161193</a>]<br></li>
<li>Only one gene in this expression pattern , glcC , was also identified in the study by Liu and De Wulf ( 22 ) ; however , their results indicated that glcG is repressed by ArcA ( 2.6-fold ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this study , uvrA gene expression was repressed when ArcA was induced in E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140472" target="_blank">16140472</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this study , we used DarcA , DfadR and DarcA/DfadR mutants to analyse the roles played by ArcA and FadR on gene expression of the fad regulon in response to oxygen .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Based on the position of the putative FadR binding site , it seemed likely that FadR and ArcA negatively regulate fadH expression , as previously reported ( 8 ) , whereas CRP activates fadH transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20622065" target="_blank">20622065</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , the transcription of glpF and glpK is regulated by CRP and GlpR , whereas the expression of glpD is regulated by CRP , GlpR and ArcA , as proposed elsewhere [ 1,5 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22513097" target="_blank">22513097</a>]<br></li>
<li>We then measured the level of transcription of acs by RT-PCR and found that lack of ArcA results in elevated expression of the gene in both the lipA and wt strains ( Figure 1D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707605" target="_blank">20707605</a>]<br></li>
<li>We next examined the expression of the arcA-tac fusion in a AarcA genetic background to test for effects of ArcA on its own transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA is shown to antagonize H-NS action to render cydAB expression insensitive to H-NS repression in anaerobiosis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that H-NS has the potential to regulate cydAB expression negatively in both aerobiosis and anaerobiosis , but ArcA antagonizes its action in the absence of oxygen .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , ArcA represses sodA transcription in anaerobiosis , coupling its expression to aerobic respiration ( 56 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20075074" target="_blank">20075074</a>]<br></li>
<li>MraZ activates the expression of both fadB and fadE when overexpressed early in the highly aerobic log phase , when ArcA is not phosphorylated and is inactive as a repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24659771" target="_blank">24659771</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , at any given time in a population of cells , fadH expression would be regulated by FadR in one cell subpopulation and ArcA in another .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20622065" target="_blank">20622065</a>]<br></li>
<li>Deletion of the arcA gene caused about a 2-fold increase in the ptsG expression , and overexpression of ArcA significantly decreased glucose consumption .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>If ArcA is the direct repressor for ptsG expression , it was expected that utilization of glucose might be more significantly inhibited than that of other sugars by overexpression of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>Seven are members of pattern II ( increased expression during anaerobiosis and decreased expression in an ArcA strain ) : yddS , ftsW , hyaD , ldcC , ybdA , yhgE , and yrbF .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whereas maximal hya expression required AppY , RpoS , and ArcA , the response of hya to pH was e most strongly affected by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464194" target="_blank">10464194</a>]<br></li>
<li>Response of hya expression to pHe in the absence of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464194" target="_blank">10464194</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA is required for hya to respond to pHe and to achieve maximal expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464194" target="_blank">10464194</a>]<br></li>
<li>Other RRs also control ﬂagellar expression : ArcA and AtoC both activate it , while CitB and YpdB both repress it ( 330 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15755952" target="_blank">15755952</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphor-ylated ArcA , in turn , positively or negatively modulates the expression of many operons .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16980446" target="_blank">16980446</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA also serves to negatively regulate fumC expression from the fumC promoter ( Fig. 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592392" target="_blank">7592392</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under these conditions there is insuficient active FNR to occupy the low afinity upstream repressing FNR site ( FNR II ) , and the data presented here suggests that ArcA binding to this region ensures that this is so , thereby facilitating maximal yﬁD expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11932447" target="_blank">11932447</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together with the expression data discussed above , it is clear that ArcA directly represses gene expression of fadJ and fadI by binding to their promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together with the expression data discussed above , the results indicate that ArcA directly represses the gene expression of fadL and fadD by binding to the promoter regions under anaerobic conditions .

<li>DELETION OF EvgA , YdeO , H-NS DOES NOT HAVE OBVIOUS EFFECT ON THE TRANSCRIPTION FROM INDIVIDUAL PROMOTERS UNDER ANAEROBIC CONDITION Our investigation above showed that ArcA and MnmE are the major activators responsible for the expression of gadE-mdtEF under anaerobic condition , whereas other regulators tested did not show obvious regulatory effects .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , our β-galactosidase activity results showing that mnmE does not have any effect on two different ArcA dependent promoters ( PicdA and PlpdA ) suggested that MnmE does not affect the production and/or activity of ArcA under anaerobic conditions , and thus the observed reduction of gadE-mdtEF expression in mnmE strain was not due to its potential effect on ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA ANTAGONIZES THE H-NS MEDIATED REPRESSION OF gadE-mdtEF DURING THE TRANSITION FROM AEROBIC TO ANAEROBIC GROWTH Our results above showed that the expression of gadE-mdtEF is largely repressed by the DNA silencer H-NS under aerobic conditions in M9 glucose medium , whereas under anaerobic condition in the same medium its expression is activated primarily in an ArcA dependent manner .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results together suggested that the regulatory network of mdtEF expression under anaerobic condition is different from that under aerobic condition , and anaerobic activation of mdtEF is largely dependent on ArcA and MnmE .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggested that anaerobic expression of the gadE-mdtEF operon is primarily regulated by ArcA in both log phase and stationary phase under anaerobic condition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that ArcA has a negative effect on the expression of these genes during the transition from aerobic to microaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>

<li>The fact that the control of this promoter was independent of ArcA and Fnr ( Table 4 ) suggests that the prior observation by Iuchi et al. ( 9 ) that an arcA mutant was elevated for a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity when grown under anaerobic conditions is accounted for by the regulated expression of the sucAB genes from the upstream sdhC promoter .

<li>ArcA has been shown to negatively regulate arcB mRNA levels , particularly at low oxygen , ( Shalel-Levanon et al , 2005 ) ; based on our observations ( anaerobic conditions ) , it represses arcZ expression , therefore allowing higher ArcB expression and thus its own activation .

<li>The sensor ± regulator pair , ArcB ± ArcA , is responsible for the microaerobic activation of the cydAB operon , whereas the anaerobic regulator Fnr represses its expression in the absence of oxygen .

<li>Maximal expression under intermediate ( microaerobic ) oxygen levels is achieved by the counterbalance of activation by phosphorylated ArcA and repression by H-NS under aerobic conditions and repression by Fnr under anaerobicity [ 60 ] .

<li>It was also concluded that any involvement of FNR must be indirect ( or operational only in the absence of ArcA ) , because a c n A expression was not enhanced in an fnr mutant , but it was partially repressed under aerobic conditions by fnr + amplification in an arcA + strain ( Gruer & Guest , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>]<br></li>
<li>We also saw no effect of expression of ArcA at higher levels than normally found in cells , even to levels that inhibit growth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8550494" target="_blank">8550494</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the conditions of growth that minimize Dp also maximize hya expression , it is plausible that the hya response to pHe is at least partially mediated by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464194" target="_blank">10464194</a>]<br></li>
<li>Instead , the complete Cre regulon is seen only under conditions where CreC is activated and the activity of ArcA ( and possibly other regulators ) is also modi-ﬁed , perhaps releasing a block on activation of gene expression by CreB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20418396" target="_blank">20418396</a>]<br></li>
<li>These include sev - ArcA because the anaerobic induction eral of the symbiotic N2-fixation genes of cyd expression is significantly re - ( fix ) , which are probably regulated by duced in an arcA mutant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1957353" target="_blank">1957353</a>]<br></li>

<li>These data indicate that ArcA regulation requires P7 and that P7 or DNA sequences in the vicinity of P7 are involved in modulating anaerobic induction of pﬂ expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7665524" target="_blank">7665524</a>]<br></li>

<li>Identification of Differential Gene Expression Patterns Resulting from Two-variable Perturbation Experiments To identify the global changes and adjustments of gene expression patterns that facilitate a transition from aerobic to anaerobic-growth conditions and to determine the effects of genotype on these gene expression patterns , we analyzed E. coli gene expression profiles obtained from cells cultured under aerobic ( O ) or anaerobic ( O ) growth conditions 2 2 and under anaerobic-growth conditions in the presence ( O , 2 ArcA ) or absence ( O , ArcA ) of ArcA , the global regula-2 tory protein for anaerobic metabolism .

<li>Apparently a portion of the ArcA protein can exist in a phosphorylated state during aerobic-growth conditions such that icd-lacZ expression remains partly repressed except when cells are grown on substrates such as acetate or succinate ( Table 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9209047" target="_blank">9209047</a>]<br></li>
<li>This repression of mdh-lacZ expression by ArcA under aerobic conditions is thought to be caused by a fraction of the ArcA protein that exists in a partially phosphorylated state under these conditions ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592446" target="_blank">7592446</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , the lldPRD operon is proposed to be under the control of the global regulator ArcA , which binds to positions 14 to 3 with respect to the transcriptional start site , corresponding to the proposed P2 promoter , and represses the expression of this operon under anaerobic conditions ( 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18263722" target="_blank">18263722</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the expression of the cyd operon has been shown to be activated by ArcA during anaerobic as well as aerobic-growth ( 25 ) and to be repressed by Fnr during anaerobic-growth ( 12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>This operon is induced under an-aerobic conditions in the presence of formate or fumarate , repressed in the presence of nitrate , and requires acidic pH , ArcA , and AppY for optimal expression ( 12 , 21 , 32 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14702328" target="_blank">14702328</a>]<br></li>
<li>The effects of nitrate ( via NarL ) and anaerobic derepression ( ArcA dependent ) appeared to be additive , as shown by the high expression of nuoy ^ ^ / lB ' in the arcA background after anaerobic-growth with nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565112" target="_blank">7565112</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results clearly demonstrate that ArcA represses expression of arcZ during anaerobic-growth , the expected condition for ArcA to be active .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>( B ) The ArcA regulon shows greater differential expression and greater consistency for the WT aerobic/anaerobic shift and in the comparison between aerobic WT and aerobic ECOM4LA , thereby suggesting that ArcA is active in ECOM4LA , even under aerobic-growth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>The residual anaerobic repression suggests that other regulators may either repress acnA under anaerobic conditions ( especially in the absence of ArcA ) or activate a c n A expression under aerobic conditions both in the presence and absence of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>The apparent surprise is the stringent repression by ArcA seen under anaerobic conditions even in the absence of FadR because E. coli has a pathway to degrade fatty acids under anaerobic conditions [ 34 ] and low expression of FadD and FadL would seem likely to compromise function of the anaerobic pathway .

<li>Expression Pattern I : Decreased Expression during Anaerobiosis and Increased Expression in an ArcA Strain -- Among the 175 genes displayed in the clustering procedures described above , 37 showed decreased expression under anaerobic conditions due to regulation by ArcA ( Table I ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>The arcA mutant , which is deﬁcient in the O2-responsive regulator ArcA ( 9 ) , showed only a twofold decrease in dcuC9-9lacZ expression under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10368146" target="_blank">10368146</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression Pattern IV : Increased Expression during Anaerobiosis and No Change in an ArcA Strain -- The six genes of this cluster ( Table IV ) showed elevated expression under anaerobic-growth conditions , but were not affected by deletion of the arcA allele .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>To explain the peak of cyd expression observed under microaerobic conditions , it was hypothesized that the two regulatory proteins act in competition at the cyd promoter and that under strictly anaerobic conditions the relatively weakly acting FNR protein out-competes the ArcA protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1957353" target="_blank">1957353</a>]<br></li>
<li>Other than its effect on the rpoS regulon , CsgD expression appears to regulate a subset of anaerobiosis-dependent genes , such as ompW and pﬂB , both induced in anaerobic conditions by FNR , either alone or in concert with ArcA ( 18 , 61 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17873038" target="_blank">17873038</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this same report , FNR and IHF were reported to have roles as weak repressors under anaerobic conditions , and it was suggested that the effect of FNR may be indirect as a consequence of its role in regulating ArcA expression ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12754220" target="_blank">12754220</a>]<br></li>
<li>FnrS is involved in gene regulation after the shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions , and its expression is activated by the transcription factors FNR and ArcA ( 20 , 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23980183" target="_blank">23980183</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , it was reported recently that ArcA and FNR repressed the expression of puuA when E. coli was grown under anaerobic conditions and that there are putative binding motifs of ArcA and FNR upstream of the open reading frame of puuA ( 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18495664" target="_blank">18495664</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rather , hya expression in S. enterica is regulated not by IscR or ArcA but , rather , by FNR under anaerobic conditions ( 38 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>is repressed by FNR and stimulated by ArcA under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9230919" target="_blank">9230919</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of cyd is thus stimulated by ArcA under microaerobic conditions and repressed by FNR unde anaerobic conditions , resulting in a maximal expression under microaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11931557" target="_blank">11931557</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA alone appears to slightly repress PhyaA under anaerobic conditions , since a strain containing deletions of appY and iscR ( ArcA ) showed an intermediate expression level ( Fig. 1A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA and AppY had no effect on PhyaA expression under aerobic conditions , as expected ( Fig. 1C ) , since ArcA is not active aerobically and since AppY is poorly expressed under these growth conditions ( 1 , 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regarding ArcA , the effect of ArcA on ndh expression was studied under anaerobic conditions in LB medium which was supplied with 20 mM xylose ( Liu and De Wulf , 2004 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it is possible that under our experimental conditions the effect of ArcA on ndh expression is negligible .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , FadR and ArcA seem to act synergistically in fadBA expression under anaerobic conditions in that loss of either repressor results in only a small ( 3 - to 4-fold ) increase in expression whereas loss of both repressors results in a 12-fold increase in expression ( Fig. 6B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20622065" target="_blank">20622065</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previous studies ( 5 , 31 ) showed that deletion of ArcA or AppY results in decreased expression of PhyaA under anaerobic conditions , which led to the hypothesis that ArcA and AppY activated PhyaA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , under anaerobic conditions , the expression of fadK is independent of FadR and ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the expression data , we saw that ArcA activation in ECOM4LA is likely responsible for the anaerobic phenotype under aerobi conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under aerobic conditions , ArcA + in a fur - fnr + background allowed for higher expression of sodA-lacZ ( compare NC439 vs. NC417 ; Table 3 , column 3 ) , while this was not the case in afur-fnr - background ( compare NC412 and NC419 ; Table 3 , column 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>This proposal is consistent with the findings of our hemA-lacZ experiments , which indicate that ArcA is functioning to activate hemA expression during aerobic-growth conditions ( Table 3 ) while the major contribution of ArcA is seen anaerobically ( e.g. , best visualized in an fnr mutant , in which a 12-fold aerobic-anaerobic difference in hemA expression is seen ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071201" target="_blank">8071201</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previous studies with fnr ' strains indicated that CRP and ArcA have no direct effect on aerobic or anaerobic ndh expression , and that NtrA ( a ^ ) enhances ndh expression about two - to threefold , but only under aerobic conditions ( Spiro et ai .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8065261" target="_blank">8065261</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA functions as a repressor of gtA expression under each set of conditions : in a 1arcA strain , glA-lacZ expression was elevated to levels two - and eightfold higher than those seen in a wild-type strain under aerobic and anaerobic conditions , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>]<br></li>
<li>As another transcription regulator that controls fatty acid metabolism , ArcA has been shown to strongly ( > 20-fold ) repress the expression of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase encoded by the fadB gene , and to weakly repress acyl-CoA dehydrogenase encoded by the fadE gene , under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA , when activated , can then bind to regulatory DNA sites to mediate both positive and negative control of gene expression ( 8 , 9 ) : cyo-ABCDE expression is repressed under anaerobic conditions , while cydAB expression is activated ( 3 , 4 , 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8576043" target="_blank">8576043</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rationale of Regulatory Patterns Regulatory pattern I ( anaerobic repressed gene expression , i.e. decreased expression in the presence of ArcA ) ( Table I ) and pattern II ( anaerobic activated gene expression , i.e. increased expression in the presence of ArcA ) ( Table II ) are most easily reconciled with previous reports .

<li>not regulated by ArcA but expression is activated by a novel regulator , Arr , which responds to the presence of amino acids during anaerobic-growth ( Green & Guest , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9308170" target="_blank">9308170</a>]<br></li>
<li>Possibly , the differences in anaerobic expression of the hya operon in glucose medium and glycerol medium reflect differences in the levels of expression of the appY gene and/or in the levels of phosphorylation of the ArcA protein during anaerobic-growth in these two media .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071220" target="_blank">8071220</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , aerobic expression of the focA gene was reduced by the p6A mutation , as was the dependence on ArcA for anaerobic induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9084161" target="_blank">9084161</a>]<br></li>

<li>In an attempt to identify possible gene products involved in the tpx gene expression in response to oxygen availability , we measured expression levels of b - galactosidase activity under different conditions of aeration in a series of strains carrying mutations in the genes encoding known aerobic/anaerobic transcriptional-regulator proteins , ArcA and Fnr ( Fig. 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10794600" target="_blank">10794600</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fumA gene transcription is positively regulated by Crp and repressed by ArcA and its expression is predominant under aerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22513097" target="_blank">22513097</a>]<br></li>
<li>The second protein that regulates anaerobic gene expression is ArcA , which was identified as being necessary for repressing expression of the succinate dehydrogenase gene under anaerobic conditions ( 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1592804" target="_blank">1592804</a>]<br></li>
<li>This anaerobic response is modulated by the ArcA protein , which functions as a repressor of mdh gene expression under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592446" target="_blank">7592446</a>]<br></li>
<li>During an-aerobic cell growth conditions , this repression is optimal : under some conditions of aerobic cell growth , ArcA appears to still partially repress gene expression ( ca .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9209047" target="_blank">9209047</a>]<br></li>
<li>Together , these results show that gene expression changes are consistent with ArcA being active in ECOM4LA under aerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>Global gene expression suggests that ArcA is active in ECOM4LA in aerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>Summary The ArcA and Fnr regulators of Escherichia coii , both of which are activated in anaerobic conditions , negatively regulate the sodA gene ( coding for manganese superoxide dismutase ) , but Fnr has no effect on anaerobic sodA expression in a \ arcAAfnr background ( Compan and Touati , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>The aerobic and anaerobic control of gltA4-lacZ expression is due primarily to the arcA gene product ( Table 4 ; Fig. 5 ) , whereas sdhCDAB gene expression is controlled by both ArcA and Fnr ( 25 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>]<br></li>
<li>The differences observed in tpx gene expression during aerobic vs. anaerobic-growth conditions were also reported for several tricarboxylic acid cycle genes , including sdhC , gltA , mdh , and for some respiratory pathway genes , frdABCD , dmsABC , narGHJI although the molecular basis for this ArcA - and Fnr-independent control is not understood ( 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10794600" target="_blank">10794600</a>]<br></li>
<li>The extent of ArcA control of gitA and sdhCDAB gene expression under aerobic conditions is in marked contrast to the lack of Fnr control under the same conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>]<br></li>
<li>The dual control of tpx gene expression regulated by ArcA and Fnr proteins appears to provide maximum protection against the toxicity of oxidative-stress during aerobic and anaerobic-growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10794600" target="_blank">10794600</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fnr represses sdhCDAB expression but oniy during anaerobic conditions , Wby does tbe aerobic/anaerobic control of sdhCDAB gene expression require two regulators , ArcA and Fnr ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7783618" target="_blank">7783618</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to the aerobic increase in FumA and FumC activities , FumB is more abundant under anaerobic conditions and fumB gene expression requires ArcA and Fnr as transcriptional-activators ( Tseng , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752906" target="_blank">22752906</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , these Fnr-independent effects may result from altered ArcA activation , rather than from altered basal promoter activity , as none of the Fnr site mutations altered cyd ± lacZ expression in wild-type cells grown in the presence of oxygen , or in an anaerobically grown DarcA strain ( data not shown ) .

<li>The 12 - to 15-foid anaerobic induction ot pfi Q & r \ e expression is mediated by seven co-ordinately regulated promoters and induction requires the concerted action of the ArcA , Fnr and integration host factor ( IHF ) proteins ( Sawers and Bock , 1988 : 1989 ; Sawers and Suppmann , 1992 ; Sirko etat .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>
<li>Using arcA ~ iac transcriptionai and translational fusions , we show that arcA expression increases ( about fourfoid ) in anaerobiosis and that both Fnr and ArcA are required for fuil expression , in a \ fnr background , there ts no auto-activation , suggesting that ArcA enhances activation by Fnr .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>To determine whether ArcA-dependent Fnr repression of sodA was produced by Fnr activation of arcA transcription , we have investigated the effects of Fnr and ArcA on arcA expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>Positive control ( i.e. , transcriptional activation of gene expression ) is provided by ArcA , while negative control ( i.e. , transcriptional repression of gene expression ) is due to the Fnr protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071201" target="_blank">8071201</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA appears to function as an anaerobic activator of hernA gene expression , while Fnr repression is dependent on ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071201" target="_blank">8071201</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the aerobic/anaerobic control of fumA and fumC gene expression involves ArcA repression at both the fumA and fumC promoters , while Fnr regulates fumC at a distance from the fumA promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592392" target="_blank">7592392</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , these findings indicate that promoter P7 activity accounts for the anaerobic induction of expression in derivative ARM1036 and that ArcA mediates anaerobic induction when the Fnr-dependent P6 promoter is inactivated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9084161" target="_blank">9084161</a>]<br></li>
<li>Maximal anaerobic induction of pfl expression depends heavily on the Fnr protein but in its absence ArcA is still functional in eliciting at least a partial anaerobic induction of expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>
<li>Aerobic expression was also reduced partially by Fnr and ArcA control anaerobic induction of focA the p6-2 mutation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9084161" target="_blank">9084161</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Fnr and ArcA proteins were not required for this anaerobic induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of the appY gene is induced immediately by anaerobiosis , and this anaerobic induction is independent of Fnr , and AppY , but dependent on ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>The anaerobic control of icd expression by ArcA and that by Fnr appear to occur relatively independently of each other .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9209047" target="_blank">9209047</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Fnr protein is responsible for this anaerobic induction , but a twofold reduction in a AarcA background indicates that ArcA contributes to the activation of its own expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , ArcA was required for elevated P1 , P2 , P3 and P4 expression in the absence of Fnr ( Fig. 6 , compare lanes 7 and 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>Additionally , these data indicate that Fnr and ArcA can act independently of each other to control cyo-lacZ expression , in contrast to the requirement of ArcA for Fnr control of cyd-lacZ expression ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8576043" target="_blank">8576043</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fnr bound at the half-site upstream of P7 may function together with bound ArcA ( 5 ) to activate expression from the P7 promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7665524" target="_blank">7665524</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rather , it appears that both ArcA and Fnr can regulate pﬂ expression under particular circumstances in aerobically grown cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7665524" target="_blank">7665524</a>]<br></li>
<li>In strains defective in ArcA and Fnr synthesis , expression was reduced both aerobically and anaerobically .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7665524" target="_blank">7665524</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the Fnr and ArcA proteins appear to function independently of each other to control fumA expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592392" target="_blank">7592392</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similarly , Fnr can function in mediating partial induction of expression in the absenoe of ArcA or IHF .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>

<li>Surprisingly , we also found that even in the absence of AppY and ArcA , wild-type IscR could not repress PhyaA anaerobically as well as an IscR mutant that lacked the Fe-S cluster or as well as wild-type IscR aerobically at the same protein concentrations .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>The repression by IscR in the absence of either ArcA or AppY appears to be a direct result of IscR binding , since the increase in expression observed from a mutation that is known to disrupt the IscR binding site ( C-to-G mutation at position 50 in PhyaA [ PhyaA ( 50G ) ] ) ( 28 ) mimicked the increase in expression of the iscR strains ( Fig. 1B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the decreased expression of PhyaA that arises when strains lack ArcA ( AppY and IscR ) or AppY ( ArcA and IscR ) is reversed by the further elimination of IscR from either strain ( Fig. 1A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although isolation of AppY will be required before we can elucidate how this protein inhibits IscR repression at PhyaA , the simplest explanation is that both AppY and ArcA block IscR binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ability of ArcA and AppY to act as antirepressors of IscR repression of PhyaA depended on IscR levels , suggesting that IscR competes with ArcA and/or AppY for binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , while the role of AppY in preventing repression by IscR is unclear , the simplest model from the combined results is that both AppY and ArcA act as antirepressors , competing with the repressor IscR for binding to PhyaA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>thermore , by similarly increasing the levels of IscR in a strain lacking ArcA and AppY , we found that less IscR was required for repression anaerobically ( Fig. 3C ) than in strains containing AppY and ArcA ( Fig. 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , much greater repression was observed aerobically than anaerobically at the same concentrations of IPTG , consistent with direct IscR repression at PhyaA without competition from ArcA and AppY aerobically .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>In sum , we have found that a combinatorial strategy leads to ArcA and AppY overcoming IscR repression at PhyaA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>To understand the contribution of each DR in ArcA repression of icdA , they were mutated toward or away from 5 = - TGTTA-3 = ( Fig. 1C ) , the most conserved sequence within each ArcA DR element ( hereinafter referred to as the consensus ) and , based on the PhoB DNA cocrystal structure ( 15 ) , the region likely contacted by ArcA in the major groove .

<li>As a working model , it is tempting to speculate that it is only when ArcA repression is relieved , i.e. when toxic oxygen derivatives are produced as byproducts of aerobic metabolism and iron becomes a threat , that Fur would start to play a role in regulating sodA .

<li>ArcA and RssB are phosphorylated and cooperate to keep S levels low by repressing rpoS transcription and stimulating S proteolysis , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>levels increase as rpoS transcriptional repression by ArcA is relieved and S proteolysis is slowed down ( since the cellular level of phosphorylated RssB is limiting for the overall rate of S degradation ) ( Pruteanu and Hengge-Aronis 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test whether the enhanced repression of P1icdA with mutant ArcA binding sites is still dependent on phosphorylation , the aspartate residue at position 54 ( site of phosphorylation [ 19 ] ) in the chromosomal copy of arcA was mutated to yield either alanine or glutamate , preventing phosphorylation from ArcB ( 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25161193" target="_blank">25161193</a>]<br></li>
<li>We expected ArcA ( D54E ) to similarly reduce the repression of P1icdA , since this substitution has previously been shown to prevent both phosphorylation from ArcB and binding to the pﬂ promoter ( 19 ) .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>In conclusion , S accumulation in cells entering into starvation is likely to be controlled by the interference of oxidized quinones with ArcB autophosphorylation and , therefore , reduced phosphorylation of RssB and ArcA , which results in reduced S proteolysis and a relief of rpoS transcriptional repression ( Fig. 7B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>An autoregulatory loop : effects of ArcZ on ArcB and vice versa ArcB leads to the activation of ArcA ( measurable by increased repression of the ParcZ -- lac and of a Psdh -- lacZ fusion ; as expected , this is fully ArcA dependent ) , and therefore tighter repression of arcZ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>During the switch to aerobiosis , it is unclear how stimulation of ArcB-ArcA is relieved when electron transport via the aerobic respiratory chain is still tumed off by ArcA repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the four repressing plasmids seem to activate ArcB signalling to ArcA , resulting in increased repression of arcZ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>In those studies , evidence of both ArcA repression of rpoS transcription and ArcB stimulation of RpoS degradation was found .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA repression of ArcZ provides a third level of negative regulation , and our studies with arcA and arcZ mutations demonstrate that this regulation has a signiﬁcant effect on translation of RpoS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>Another possibility is that the nitrate repression is an indirect effect of ArcA regulation , since the phosphorylation of the ArcA protein by ArcB presumably is dependent on the respiratory state of the cell ( 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071220" target="_blank">8071220</a>]<br></li>
<li>As activation by ArcA is maximal in microaerobiosis ( Tseng et al. , 1996 ) , we favour the hypothesis that ArcA anti-repression prevents H-NS control in microaerobiosis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Once active , ArcA directly binds to the promoter regions of fad regulon genes , resulting in transcriptional repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>There is a physiological rationale for the repression of feaR by PhoB and ArcA : O2 is required for the catab-olism of monoamines , and H2O2 is a threat to membrane integrity during phosphate-starvation ( 20 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24013633" target="_blank">24013633</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that ArcA still has a regulatory role in the absence of H-NS strongly suggests that , in addition to antagonizing H-NS repression , ArcA also directly activates cydAB transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>The addition of DR4 to the 3 = end disrupted promoter function , preventing assessment of ArcA repression ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25161193" target="_blank">25161193</a>]<br></li>
<li>The addition of ArcA caused marked repression of transcription from ssbP3 and weaker repression of transcription from ssbP1 and ssbP2 Fig. 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140472" target="_blank">16140472</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , if this argument holds , then a strain incapable of synthesizing ArcA should show stronger nitrate repression in rich medium than in minimal medium , which is not what is observed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>As ArcA most often acts as a repressor , it is tempting to speculate that ArcA may exert its activation by relieving H-NS repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , we demonstrated that the ArcA dependent activation of the operon is through its antagonistic effect on the H-NS mediated repression of the operon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results do not distinguish direct repression by ArcA from an indirect effect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , H-NS repression of these four promoters is antagonized by ArcA in the absence of oxygen .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA was identified as the dominant repressor , with the major repression occurring at 0 -- 4 % oxygen .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752906" target="_blank">22752906</a>]<br></li>

<li>Several mechanisms are also possible to explain how ArcA relieves H-NS repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>Either of these mechanisms could account for the relief of H-NS repression by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>

<li>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I protection assays indicate that where the phosphorylated form of the ArcA protein ( ArcA-P ) is expected to act as a transcriptional-repressor ( e.g. , of lctPRD and gltA-sdhCDAB ) , the effect is likely to be mediated by sequestration of cis-controlling transcriptional-regulatory elements .

<li>To test whether IscR and ArcA can bind simultaneously , electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with radiolabeled hyaA DNA , IscR , and/or phosphorylated ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since only ArcA-P binds to the DNA and the extent of in vitro phosphorylation of ArcA by acetyl-phosphate has not been determined , the actual concentration of ArcA-P in this experiment could be lower than the total ArcA ( ArcA + ArcA-P ) in the reaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , while chemical cross-linking studies indicate that phosphorylation of the His6-ArcA protein stimulates dimerization of the protein ( 34a ) , the effect appears to be insufﬁcient to explain quantitatively the large differences observed in the in vitro DNA binding properties of the His - ArcA and His-6 6 ArcA-P proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8892825" target="_blank">8892825</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is possible that phosphorylation of the ArcA protein also facilitates cooperative interactions of mol-ecules bound to the DNA , as is apparent in the case of the NtrC protein ( see chapters 5 and 9 in reference 20 ) .

<li>Interpretation of Clustering Results Although some of the genes or operons differentially expressed in the presence or absence of ArcA are expected to be affected only indirectly , others whose expression is directly regulated by ArcA should possess a DNA-binding site ( s ) upstream of their transcriptional start site ( s ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the expression levels of the 40 genes of patterns III and IV were not affected by the presence or absence of ArcA , they are not expected to possess binding sites for this regulatory protein .

<li>De-ﬁning how these ArcA cis-regulatory elements contribute to ArcA DNA binding and repression is critical to understanding how the ArcAB system coordinates this global reprogramming of transcription .

<li>This suggests that , independent of the strength of the binding site , repression is largely dependent on the phosphorylated form of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25161193" target="_blank">25161193</a>]<br></li>
<li>The analysis of the effects of mutations eliminating individual DR elements suggests that DR1 and DR2 determine the overall strength of ArcA binding and that all three DR elements contribute to repression .

<li>In support of this competition model , electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting showed that the ArcA and IscR binding sites overlap and that binding of ArcA and IscR is mutually exclusive .

<li>Based on the DNase I footprint and electro-phoretic mobility shift assays presented in this study , we propose that ArcA antagonizes IscR repression by partially occluding IscR binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21252224" target="_blank">21252224</a>]<br></li>
<li>The predicted ArcA activity profile suggested a linear decrease in activity with increasing aerobiosis , a response similar to that of qacetate , which is the basis of the aerobiosis scale ( Fig. 3A , closed squares ) .

<li>The bet genes belong to the ArcA modulon , consisting of genes repressed by anaerobicity , and the binding of ArcA appears to require a sequence of the betT side of the overlapping promoters ( 20 ) .

<li>The footprints observed with ArcA phosphorylated in vitro were essentially the same as seen wilh untreated ArcA but much less protein ( -- • 10-fold ) was required to produce the same footprint .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results indicated that D1 was signiﬁcantly more active than ArcA as an acceptor and that ArcA was in turn signiﬁcantly more active than H2 ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>

<li>The phosphoryl group is then sequentially transferred to Asp576 and His717 and from there to Asp54 of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10851007" target="_blank">10851007</a>]<br></li>
<li>The triangles below the autoradiograph show increasing concentrations of either ArcA or ArcA-P .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10071223" target="_blank">10071223</a>]<br></li>
<li>The minimum concentration of phosphorylated ArcA required for this protection was about 0.3 µM .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>The phosphorylated ArcA was used immediately .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>The protein concentrations of ArcA and IscR and the iron and sulﬁde content of IscR were determined colorimetrically , as described previously ( 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>

<li>The purified ArcA protein was only active up to a week , as judged by DNase I footprinting assay .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>The phosphorylation level was from 1 % to 10 % for TorR , PhoB , CusR , BasR , RstA , UvrY , ArcA , BaeR , NtrC , KdpE , UhpA , and PhoP ( in decreasing order ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15522865" target="_blank">15522865</a>]<br></li>
<li>The amounts of ArcA were as follows : lanes 1 and 6 , 0 pmol ; lanes 2 and 7 , 1.25 pmol ; lanes 3 and 8 , 2.5 pmol ; lanes 4 and 9 , 5 pmol ; lanes 5 and 10 , 10 pmol .

<li>It also seems possible that an ArcA molecule can be modified by both sensors , thereby acquiring dual negative and positive activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2201868" target="_blank">2201868</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , it is also possible that the output from the cydA-lacZ reporter was influenced by additional regulators , and thus , the direct determination of ArcA phosphorylation reported here is likely to be a more reliable and accurate measure of ArcA activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21252224" target="_blank">21252224</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , ArcA is necessary for the fully extended lifespan of the lipA and lpdA strains and its constitutive activation is sufficient to extend the lifespan of wt .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707865" target="_blank">20707865</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consequently , it would be natural to hypothesize that enzymes involved in the metabolism of other carbon sources requiring activation to acetyl-CoA are also members of the ArcA regulon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur and ArcA proteins were expressed by heat induction , as follows : overnight cultures at 30 ° C in enriched medium fTerB ) plus ampicillin and kanamycin were diluted 1/100 in fresh TerB medium plus ampicillin and kanamycin .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>Other represented functions in our dataset relate to sensing and stimulus responses , mostly proteins belonging to two component systems , such as ArcA , RcsB , CpxR and EvgA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25518064" target="_blank">25518064</a>]<br></li>

<li>Regulator proteins such as CRP and ArcA were added to the reaction as described under `` Results .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>

<li>Thus , it can be inferred that the TCA cycle is predominantly regulated at the transcriptional level by TFs such as ArcA and also allosterically inhibited by ATP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20299454" target="_blank">20299454</a>]<br></li>
<li>This latter promoter is regulated by ArcA since Lpd is also part of the succinate dehydrogenase complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19838295" target="_blank">19838295</a>]<br></li>
<li>The in vitro studies also con cents rmed that P lpd pdh activity is not regulated by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9868788" target="_blank">9868788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , based on this in vitro evidence , it was concluded that Ppdh is not regulated by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9868788" target="_blank">9868788</a>]<br></li>
<li>GatY is a reversible enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of tagatose-1 ,6 phosphate from DHAP and GA3P ; it is regulated by CRP , ArcA and GatR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22513097" target="_blank">22513097</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thereafter , as cultures progressed into stationary phase , the absence of ArcA abrogated elevated hya levels in acidic medium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464194" target="_blank">10464194</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , Acs also sensitized cells lacking ArcA to heat-shock , in the absence of extracellular acetate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707605" target="_blank">20707605</a>]<br></li>
<li>We tested tbe effect of incubating ArcA with carbamoyi phosphate prior to its inclusion in a gel retardation assay .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>
<li>An effect of ArcA in contributing to RpoS accumulation in stationary phase has been reported previously ( Mika and Hengge , 2005 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>All these HKs are , however , known to form TCS with the respective cognate RR partner ( ArcA for pArcB ; CheB and CheY for pCheA ; and UhpA for pUhpB ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15522865" target="_blank">15522865</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that the ArcA-II site is required for positive control by ArcA in aerobiosis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>
<li>This may indicate that an oligomeric structure of ArcA is disrupted by incubation at low temperature .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>
<li>This may result from ArcA repression of fnr ( Fig. 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752906" target="_blank">22752906</a>]<br></li>
<li>This possibility was tested by examining the hya response to pHe in the absence of ArcA ( Fig. 2C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464194" target="_blank">10464194</a>]<br></li>
<li>This ability of ArcA to-bind to DNA in absence of its auxiliary kinase when present in large amount , is in agreement with genetic observations .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fractions containing ArcA were pooled , dialysed against buffer B and concentrated to a protein concentration of approximately 4,5 mgmr ' using a Centricon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>
<li>Incubation of His6-ArcA protein in buffers containing 10 to 50 mM acetyl phosphate or carbamoyl phosphate resulted in precipitation of the protein when the concentration of the protein exceeded 100 mg/ml ( 3.5 mM ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8892825" target="_blank">8892825</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylated ArcA retarded the Ppdh fragment , but only in direct proportion to the protein concentration , indicating that the binding is non-speci cents c .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9868788" target="_blank">9868788</a>]<br></li>
<li>This group is subsequently transferred to an aspartate residue in the ArcA protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8226939" target="_blank">8226939</a>]<br></li>
<li>This DNase I protection is specific for ArcA-P , and ArcA protein by itself did not protect moe DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>In theory , cells deficient in ArcA could contain higher levels of intracellular MMS and thus be susceptible to more DNA damage .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18824089" target="_blank">18824089</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the context of conjugal fertility , ArcA responds to signals from another transmembrane sensor , CpxA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1957353" target="_blank">1957353</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this model , a functional ArcA protein is required for the hypothetical regulator to act properly .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071201" target="_blank">8071201</a>]<br></li>
<li>the signal to ArcA by converting it into there being a decreasing preference for Recently , transcriptional-regulators its active ( phosphorylated ) form ( Fig .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1957353" target="_blank">1957353</a>]<br></li>
<li>Site II is bound slightly better by phosphorylated ArcA and may act as a nucleation site ( Fig. 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Assuming tbat ArcA is active only when it is phosphorylated , some fraction of ArcA must be in the active state even wben cells are grown in air-saturated media .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7783618" target="_blank">7783618</a>]<br></li>
<li>This prompted experiments to measure the amounts of phosphorylated ArcA , which did correlate well with ArcA activity predicted by the model .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21252224" target="_blank">21252224</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consequently , the increased level of phosphorylated ArcA activates and represses the synthesis of many enzymes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>
<li>As predicted from the role of activator , only the phosphorylated form of ArcA binds to the moe upstream sequence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus ArcA overproduced in crude extracts could also be phosphorylated by non-specific phospho-donors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , D54E ArcA appears to partially mimic phosphorylated ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25161193" target="_blank">25161193</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it is concluded that ArcA activity inferred from analysis of transcript profiles corresponds to the cellular content of phosphorylated ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21252224" target="_blank">21252224</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the individuai footprints were ill-defined wben the concentration of phosphorylated ArcA exceeded 20 [ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA was phosphorylated using carbamoyl phosphate as the phospho donor as described previously ( 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>In each case , the concentrations of phosphorylated ArcA ( WM ) were ( left to right ) : no protein ; 0.5 ; 1.0 ; and 2.0 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9868788" target="_blank">9868788</a>]<br></li>
<li>AcrA-P refers to phosphorylated His6-ArcA protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Freshly prepared ArcA protein was phosphorylated immediately before use .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the OD420nm of the culture reached 0.7 ( Spectronic 710 ) , ArcA production was induced by isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyra-noside at a final concentration of 0.2 mM .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , during the initial minute , the amount of radioactivity gained by ArcA was approximately equal to that lost by H2-P .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , ArcA is phosphorylated much more rapidly by H2-P than by H1-P .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since D1 , H2 , and ArcA did not autophosphorylate , their abilities to accept the phosphoryl group from H1-P were compared .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>

<li>A quantification of this competition experiment is shown in C , with RssB phosphorylation given as the percentage of maximal phosphorylation in the absence of ArcA , and ArcA phosphorylation given in arbitrary ( PhosphorImager ) units .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>To conﬁrm that H1 can not mediate the phosphorylation of ArcA without H2 , we replaced arcB1 by arcB1 -- 520 , arcB1 -- 661 , arcB1 -- 661 , D576A , or arcBD576A , H717Q .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10851007" target="_blank">10851007</a>]<br></li>
<li>Purification and phosphorylation of ArcA ArcA protein was purified as described previously [ 21 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>This addition rapidly accelerated the phosphorylation of ArcA ( Fig .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>

<li>More studies are required to clarify the relation between polymerization and phosphorylation of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>

<li>As we show here , ArcZ activates rpoS translation , and ArcZ is repressed by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , our data suggest that ArcA should also repress rpoS translation through ArcZ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mo-derate changes in activity for ArcA were predicted , perhaps indicative of membrane effects .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , since our focus is the transient behaviour of Fur and SoxS , we will not investigate ArcA activity any further .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>It appears , therefore , that ArcA can exist in different activated forms .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2201868" target="_blank">2201868</a>]<br></li>
<li>It would appear , therefore , that ArcA , when activated by CpxA or other sensors , represses ompF .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2201868" target="_blank">2201868</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , when nitrate is present ArcA may not be activated to the same extent as when nitrate is absent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071220" target="_blank">8071220</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA was less readily activated by incubation with carbamoyi phosphate after storage at - 2 0 C or - 7 0 C .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>

<li>These results suggested that sodA repression is partially mediated by Fnr and that increased levels of Fnr ( due to the presence of a multicopy plasmid bearing the fnr + gene ) can partially ( -50 % ) substitute for the absence of Fur , ArcA , or both .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>During a study of sodA regulation , we noticed that Fnr repression of sodA was at least partially ArcA dependent ( Compan and Touati , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>Results Fnr modulates ArcA-dependent regulation of the sodA and sdh genes In studies of MnSOD reguiation several observations suggested that Fnr repression of the sodA gene was at least partly indirect and mediated by ArcA : a A ^ nr mutation had no effect in a AarcAAfur background ( Fig. 1 ) ; and , more strikingly , Fnr repression was not completely abolished in constructs in which the putative Fnr-binding sites were destroyed ( Compan and Touati , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , ArcA repression of fumA and fumC at various oxygen concentrations was found to be stronger than that of Fnr .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22752906" target="_blank">22752906</a>]<br></li>
<li>As P1 , P3 and P4 are extremely sensitive to Fnr repression , we propose that the activity of these promoters may peak only under the narrow window of oxygen tensions in which ArcA is active , but Fnr is not .

<li>Regulators such as ArcA , Fur , and Fnr would be found in much lower concentrations in the cell ; thus it is not surprising that their binding activities are not evident in cell-free extracts .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7862094" target="_blank">7862094</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the event that Fnr repression resulted from interaction with RNAP , Fnr binding or activity would have to be directly or indirectly modulated by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10998176" target="_blank">10998176</a>]<br></li>

<li>We first assess whether another gene negatively reguiated by ArcA , ( sdh ) ( luchi and Lin , 1988 ) , is regulated by Fnr in an ArcA-dependent manner .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>This led to the hypothesis that Fnr activates arcA transcription and prompted us to examine the effect of fnr mutations on another ArcA repressed gene , sdh , coding for succinate dehydrogenase ( luchi and Lin , 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>Clearly , il will be necessary to examine the occupancy of site A-1 by ArcA in the presence of RNA polymerase and Fnr before any speculation can be made as to the physiological relevance of this binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>

<li>The focA ± pfl operon is also co-ordinately regulated by ArcA and Fnr ( although both proteins act as activators ) and is also transcribed from multiple ( seven ) promoters ( Sawers and BoÈck , 1989 ; Sawers , 1993 ; Drapal and Sawers , 1995 ) .

<li>This suggests that under these conditions ArcA has a negative effect on gltA while Fnr has a slightly positive effect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that the negative effect of ArcA and Fnr on cyoA is not additive .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>
<li>This , however , should not reverse the autoregulatory effect of ArcA , and it would not account for the Fnr modulation of ArcA regulation of sodA and sdh that we observed in anaerobiosis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>There are also dual effects of Fnr and ArcA which can not be completely explained by arcA regulation and suggest functional Fnr-ArcA interactions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>

<li>One possible explanation for this result is that as a result of the Fnr-2 mutation , Fnr no longer can bind to this sequence , which consequently affects the interaction of ArcA with the P7 regulatory sequences .

<li>This indicates that ArcA activation is not absolutely dependent on Fnr .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that ArcA co-operates with Fnr in Pa activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>

<li>The dual pattern of hemA gene regulation by the Fnr and ArcA regulatory proteins is similar to that seen for the genes for cytochrome d oxidase in E. coli ( Table 3 ) , where Fnr functions to repress cydAB gene expression while ArcA somehow functions to activate their expression ( 6 , 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071201" target="_blank">8071201</a>]<br></li>
<li>Effect of the arcA and fnr gene products on sdhC-lacZ expression As a 10-fold difference in scy/7C - / acZ expression occurred in response to O ^ availahiiity , we tested the effect of the two known aerohic/anaerobic regulatory proteins , Fnr and ArcA , in this process .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7783618" target="_blank">7783618</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the ArcA and/or the Fnr proteins are known to regulate several TCA cycle genes , including the sdhCDAB , mdh , gltA , acnA , and fumAC genes , in E. coli in response to anaerobiosis ( 6 , 8 , 16 -- 19 , 27 ) , we examined the effects of arcA and fnr gene deletions on sucA-lacZ and sdhCDAB-sucA-lacZ expression ( Table 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9209026" target="_blank">9209026</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the ArcA and Fnr proteins are known to regulate a number of E. coli genes in response to anaerobiosis , we examined the effect of deleting each regulatory gene on gltA-lacZ expression ( Table 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , even moderate up-regulation of ArcA ( as observed in stationary-phase cells , see Fig. 6B ) should result in down-regulation of RssB activity and , therefore , S stabilization ( Fig. 6C ; for further discussion , see below ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our third attempt to gain a mechanistic insight into the regulation of lifespan by ArcA and Acs in the lipA strain was based on the published observation of a time-dependent increase in the amount of protein carbonyls during the stationary phase incubation of a wt population ( Dukan and Nystrom , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707605" target="_blank">20707605</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that ArcA , either directly or indirectly , reduces fatty acid transport in the absence of oxygen through the repression of fadL and fadD expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that ArcA , either directly or indirectly , represses the b-oxidation pathway in the absence of oxygen , through the negative regulation of fadE , fadB , fadA and fadH .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of oxygen , the oxygen-sensitive global regulators ArcA and FNR mediate the repression of many TCA promoters , but most dramatically the sdh-suc operon , which encodes SDH , KDGH , and the SCSC ( 104 , 105 , 170 , 293 , 335 , 339 , 406 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15755952" target="_blank">15755952</a>]<br></li>
<li>In summary , we have investigated the regulation of fatty acid metabolism by oxygen , and found that fatty acid transport and degradation is repressed by ArcA in the absence of oxygen .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this investigation we dem-onstrate that regulation of bet by choline , oxygen , and osmotic stress is mediated by three separate mechanisms ; i.e. , BetI , ArcA , and an as yet unidentiﬁed osmotic signal .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626294" target="_blank">8626294</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , in the absence of glucose , ArcA and Fis are the most plausible candidates for mediating the co-regulation of lipoamide dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase synthesis via the respective lpd and sdh promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9868788" target="_blank">9868788</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results support the view that co-regulation of the lpd and sdh promoters is mediated primarily by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9868788" target="_blank">9868788</a>]<br></li>
<li>It was thus concluded that the co-expres-sion of lipoamide dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase involves co-regulation of the lpd and sdh promoters , mediated primarily by ArcA and an ill-de cents ned CRP-independent mechanism of glucose repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9868788" target="_blank">9868788</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , ArcA regulation shows a strong dependence on IHF , indicating that IHF is necessary to allow ArcA to engage in transcriptional activation of this promoter system .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the case of glpD , besides regulation by GlpR , the promoter is subject to regulation by cyclic AMP-CRP and by the ArcA / ArcB systems ( 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8955388" target="_blank">8955388</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this study , we demonstrate that ArcA and ArcB mediate this residual transcriptional activation of the pfl operon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1592804" target="_blank">1592804</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this case , microaerobic activation is mediated by ArcA , P located at 295 relative to the transcript start .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11169114" target="_blank">11169114</a>]<br></li>
<li>To investigate ArcA regulation of the b-oxidation pathway , qPCR was used to measure transcript levels of fadE , fadB , fadA and fadH in the wild type , DarcA , DfadR and DarcA / DfadR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the ChIP results , and the transcript level of fadK in the wild type and DarcA mutant , indicate that its transcription is independent of ArcA regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA can positively or negatively regulate transcription of aerobic enzymes and has been demonstrated to control the resistance of E. coli to specific dyes [ 43 ] , presumably through regulation of envelope proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18824089" target="_blank">18824089</a>]<br></li>
<li>If this extra regulatory loop is conﬁrmed , it would suggest that not only do ArcA and ArcB negatively regulate RpoS , but RpoS participates in the negative regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>In conclusion , our results add the regulation of stationary phase heat-shock resistance to the cellular phenotypes regulated by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707605" target="_blank">20707605</a>]<br></li>
<li>For some of them an oxygendependent regulation was previously reported : TalA and AcnA are negatively regulated by ArcA ( 51 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17015655" target="_blank">17015655</a>]<br></li>
<li>Anaerobic regulation of the cyx-appA operon by ArcA and AppY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>A different pattern was found in the anaerobic regulation of the acid phosphatase operon , suggesting that here ArcA and AppY act coordinately in activating the anaerobic transcription of the cyx-appA operon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>This may be due to the up-regulation of arcA and its gene product ArcA , since cydB operon is under the positive control , while cyoA is under negative control of ArcA ( Additional file 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19055729" target="_blank">19055729</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests a negative role for ArcA in regulation of the hyb operon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , this suggests there is mutual negative regulation of arcB and arcZ RNAs , and this is ArcA independent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>Oxygen regulation by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626294" target="_blank">8626294</a>]<br></li>
<li>Functionally , the purpose for this regulatory feedback loop may be to provide a homeostatic regulation of the ArcA/ArcB regulon : when ArcZ is highly produced ( aerobic-growth ) , it represses ArcA activation by downregulating the levels of ArcB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>To further validate the activation of ArcA in ECOM4LA during aerobic-growth , we looked at genes previously identiﬁed as direct targets of ArcA regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA was reported to be necessary for the ROS resistance of Haemophilus influenzae due to its regulation of Dps , a ferritin-like small protein that was previously reported to be involved in ROS resistance of Salmonella [ 39,47 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19715602" target="_blank">19715602</a>]<br></li>
<li>For some genes , the observed changes in protein levels were consistent with known transcriptional regulation , such as ArcA activation of the operons encoding yccB and ybgT .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19734316" target="_blank">19734316</a>]<br></li>
<li>, B-Galactosidase specific activity ( 28 ) from a pfl-lacZ fusion was determined for cells grown aerobically ( solid bars ) , anaerobically ( open bars ) , or anaerobically with pyruvate ( stippled bars ) in rich media with the following strains : wt ( wild type ) , parent , RM123 ; himD , IHF - , RM444 ; frzr , FNR - , RM135 ; arcA , ArcA - , RM320 ; fnr himD , FNR - IHF - , RM324 .

<li>Part of the reason may be explained as follows : In the cultivation of cyoA and cydB mutants , cAMP-Crp was down-regulated , where this caused mlc gene to be down-regulated , which caused ptsG and ptsH genes to be up-regulated as seen in Figure 2e , where ptsG is also under control of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21272324" target="_blank">21272324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , to determine whether the observed asymmetry of the ndh response could be accounted for by changes in the activities of ArcA and FNR , a dynamical model was developed based on high-resolution RT-PC data for a training set of genes that were either ArcA - ( hypB and icd ) or FNR - ( dmsB , hybO ) regulated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that we might expect the total number of genes directly activated or repressed by ArcA to be in the range of 290 genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>Liu and De Wulf identified a total of 138 genes as being activated in the presence of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , as suggested previously by us ( 1 ) and Liu and De Wulf ( 22 ) , the total number of genes directly activated or repressed by ArcA and FNR is likely to be much higher than documented previously .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , most of the genes in group III are repressed by the O2-sensing system mediated by ArcA ( 49 , 70 ) , and although not directly demonstrated , the data in this paper suggest that these genes can also be repressed by FNR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659690" target="_blank">15659690</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the transcription factor MarA is not directly regulated by FNR or ArcA , four genes that are activated by MarA ( acnA , fumC , sodA , zwf ) are repressed by ArcA and/or FNR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23980183" target="_blank">23980183</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , all the fad genes repressed by FadR are also repressed by the ArcA transcription factor ( encoded by arcA ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23026122" target="_blank">23026122</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA can therefore function as an activator and as a repressor , and it is particularly interesting that ArcA regulates quite distinct sets of genes in response to signals from different sensors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1957353" target="_blank">1957353</a>]<br></li>
<li>It seems likely that a subset of genes that have been assigned to the ArcA/ArcB regulon are in fact indirectly regulated by ArcA , through ArcZ , but the complexity of the effects of ArcA , RpoS , and the apparent broad effects of ArcZ leave this as an interesting future direction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>Of these 37 genes , 10 have been reported to be directly regulated by ArcA ( 6 ) , and 27 are newly discovered genes that are regulated either directly or indirectly by this global regulatory protein .

<li>Anaerobically , the intracellular concentration of active FNR becomes suficient to allow occupation of the FNRII site by displacing ArcA , and thereby inhibit the transcription activation mediated by the FNR dimer bound at FNR I .

<li>Anaerobically , the intracellular concentration of active FNR is now sufﬁcient to-bind at the FNR II site by displacing ArcA and thereby inhibit the transcription activation mediated by the FNR dimer bound at FNR I .

<li>When iron becomes scarce , Fur becomes inactive , resulting in derepression of sodA transcription ; however , only under conditions in which FNR and ArcA are inactive ( i.e. in presence of O2 ) .

<li>Consistent with this hypothesis , growth in the presence of pyruvate or under microaerobic conditions elevates the level of YﬁD ( 50 , 290 ) , while the pyruvate-sensitive regulator PdhR and the ox-ygen-sensitive global regulators FNR and ArcA control yﬁD transcription ( 290 , 476 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15755952" target="_blank">15755952</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has recently been shown that , under anaerobic-growth conditions , Fpg activity increases in strains deﬁcient in the global regulators Fur , FNR , and ArcA ( 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10400579" target="_blank">10400579</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the regulatory outcome is essentially reciprocal in that FNR usually activates transcription , whereas ArcA generally acts as a negative regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20075074" target="_blank">20075074</a>]<br></li>

<li>Other studies have shown that ArcA functions to activate cy-dAB transcription as oxygen becomes limiting ( 19 , 20 ) , whereas FNR is required for repression when the oxygen tension is decreased further ( 18 , 21 , 22 ) .

<li>Subsequent studies have shown that ArcA functions to anti-repress cydAB transcription when oxygen is limiting ( 46 ) , whereas FNR is required for repression when the oxygen tension is decreased further ( 14 , 17 , 45 ) .

<li>These results indicate that repression by nitrate is independent of the three transcription factors ArcA , IHF , and FNR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nitrate repression is independent of IHF , FNR , and ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>It was anticipated that nitrate repression would not show a dependence on the presence of ArcA , FNR , or IHF , which proved to be the case .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the roles of FNR and ArcA in mediating the changes in transcript profiles necessary for adaptation to growth at different oxygen availabilities are well established ( see above ) , the consequent changes in physiology are expected to modulate the activities of other transcription factors that respond to specific metabolic signals that are affected by oxygen availability .

<li>Regulatory pattern III ( anaerobically repressed , but not affected by ArcA ) and pattern IV ( anaerobically activated , but not affected by ArcA ) are most easily explained as genes controlled by the FNR protein or by an as yet unidentified global regulator such as Lrp , IHF , FIS , or H-NS .

<li>The contiguous fumB and dcuB genes are also in this group and were already known to be regulated by FNR , NarL , and ArcA ( 31 ) ; thus , at this promoter , regulation by NarL might be both direct and indirect ( via the ubiquinol pool and ArcA ) .

<li>Furthermore , these transcripts ( except dadX ) are regulated either by ArcA , FNR , or OxyR , possibly accounting for the increased abundance of these transcripts in the presence of O2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16857675" target="_blank">16857675</a>]<br></li>

<li>Many of the transcriptional changes observed were brought about by global TFs such as ArcA , FNR , CRP , IHF , pdhR and fur in ATPase and NOX ( Fig. 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20299454" target="_blank">20299454</a>]<br></li>
<li>By these criteria , ArcA , CRP , Fis , FNR , H-NS , IHF and Lrp were designated as global TFs in E. coli K-12 [ 24 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , ArcA and FNR regulate respiration in response to oxygen availability ( the variable in these experiments ) , CRP and Lrp sense nutritional state via cAMP and L-leucine concentrations , and Fis , H-NS and IHF modify DNA topology , which is itself dependent on energy status [ 7,25 -- 27 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it is concluded that ArcA , CRP , Fis , FNR , H-NS , IHF and Lrp are truly global regulators , at least as far as the response to oxygen availability is concerned , in the sense that their outputs create the transcriptional framework upon which local regulators operate in response to specific unstable environments Table 1 .

<li>4 Transcript mapping and regulatory studies with a dctA-lacZ transcriptional fusion showed that the dctA gene is monocis-tronic , has a single transcriptional start site , and is activated by cyclic AMP receptor protein ( CRP ) in the absence of glucose , repressed by ArcA during anaerobiosis , and weakly activated by the recently identiﬁed DcuS-DcuR system ( 13 , 57 ) in the presence of C4-dicarboxylates .

<li>In common with Plpd , the sdh promoter has been shown to be anaerobically repressed by ArcA , aerobically activated by Fis , and subject to CRP-independent repression by glucose [ 6 ] , although there are also reports that Psdh is repressed by Fis [ 7 ] and subject to CRP-dependent glucose repression [ 8 ] .

<li>Expressionfrom the suc promoter was repressed by IHF and partially activated by d8but it was not regulated by ArcA , FNR , CRP , FruR or Fis , and not repressed by glucose or anaerobiosis , indicating that the well-established catabolite and anaerobic repression of ODH synthesis is imposed elsewhere .

<li>Incontrast , the / pel promoter was repressed by both glucose ( via a CRP-independentmechanism ) and anaerobiosis ( mediated by ArcA ) , and activated by Fis , but it was not regulated by FNR , FruR , IHF or These observations support the view that transcription of the sucABCD genes is primarily initiated and regulated at the upstream sdh promoter , and that the Ipd promoter is independently co-regulated with Pdh ( primarily by ArcAmediated repression ) rather than with PsucDirect evidence for co-transcription of the entire sdhCDAksucABCD region from PHNw t as obtained by detecting a 10 kb transcript inm c and me mutants , but not inthe parental strains .

<li>It is now apparent from studies with the corresponding l a c 2 fusions that the fumA promoter resembles PacnBin being anaerobically repressed by ArcA , whereas the fumC promoter resembles P2acnAin its dual regulation by ArcA and FNR , although there is evidence that fumC transcription is partially facilitated by readthrough from the upstream fumA gene promoter ( Woods & Guest , 1987 ; Guest & Russell , 1992 ; Gruer & Guest , 1994 ; Park & Gunsalus , 1995 ) .

<li>This showed that the acnB gene is subject to repression by ArcA , Fis and FruR and activation by CRP , whereas the a c n A gene is repressed by ArcA and FNR , activated by FruR , CRP , Fur and SoxRS , and initiated by a38in stationary phase .

<li>Regulation of acnB gene transcription Apart from being activated by CRP and repressed by ArcA , the acnB gene exhibited a very different pattern of regulation to that of acnA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>]<br></li>
<li>Further studies with acn-lac2 gene fusions and a wider range of transcription regulators indicated that acnA expression is initiated by G ~ ~ from PIacnAa , nd from PZacnA it is activated directly or indirectly by CRP , FruR , Fur and SoxRS , and repressed by ArcA and FNR .

<li>M o r e recently , studies with lac2 fusions have shown that sdh gene expression is anaerobically repressed some 70-fold by the combined effects of ArcA and FNR , a n d repressed up to threefold by glucose in a CRP - ( and FruR - ) independent manner ( Iuchi et al. , 1994 ; Park et al. , 1995 ) .

<li>In contrast , inactivation of the fnr gene had no significant effect on expression of the ZpdA-lac2 fusion , but expression was repressed by the multicopy fnr + plasmid , suggesting that excess FNR can either invade the promoter and impair transcription or alternatively function indirectly by activating ArcA synthesis ( Compan & Touati , 1994 ) .

<li>DNase I footprinting analysis revealed that ArcA interacts with two sites in the rpoSp1 region in a phos-phorylation-dependent pattern ( Fig. 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>The rpoSp1 promoter region contains two ArcA-binding sites , which are occupied by phosphorylated ArcA ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>

<li>Furthermore , the majority of ArcA binding sites contain an additional one to three DR elements spaced by approximately one to two turns of the B-form DNA helix ( 11-bp or 22-bp CTC spacing ) from the minimal two DR sites ( 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25161193" target="_blank">25161193</a>]<br></li>
<li>In either scenario , the predominance of three DR sites with 11-bp CTC spacing between each DR in the E. coli genome , together with our previous ﬁnding that ArcA-P did not bind to a predicted DR3 element in which the CTC spacing was separated by an additional bp ( 4 ) , suggests that protein-protein interactions between correctly spaced subunits is important for cooperative ArcA binding to multiple DRs. Because the C-terminal domain of ArcA binds as a dimer to two adjacent DRs , one can envision that binding of an ArcA-P dimer to DR1 and -2 stabilizes a second dimer or a monomer via protein interactions with DR3 .

<li>A search using program PLsearch and alignment using program LOCAL revealed a second domain of about 120 amino acid residues in the C-terminal region that shows homology with the regulator proteins of two-com-ponent systems ( Fig. 6 ) , such as PhoB -LCB- Makino ef ai , 1986a ) , ArcA ( Dye ) ( Drury and Buxton , 1985 ) , Orf2 of the phoM operon -LCB- Amemura ef ai .

<li>D-Lactate inhibits the phosphatase activity that re - moves phosphoaspartate groups from the receiver module in ArcB , and the associated increase in phos - phorylation of this module leads to an activation of transphosphorylationof subsequently added phospho - histidine groups on ArcBto the receiver moduleof ArcA .

<li>An in vivo study utilizing ArcB domains borne by a low-copy-number plasmid led to the conclusion that the phosphoryl group from His292 could be transferred to ArcA and that this transfer was regulated by the nature of the carbon source .

<li>The receiver module with a non-phospho-rylated Asp-576 , however , hinders intermolecular transfer of the phosphoryl group to ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412675" target="_blank">8412675</a>]<br></li>
<li>hen the receiver module is phosphorylated , it allows the transmitter module-P to transfer the phosphoryl group to ArcA , whereas when the receiver module is not phosphorylated , it inhibits this reaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8226939" target="_blank">8226939</a>]<br></li>

<li>In this study , we constructed plasmids for producing and purifying the two proteins ` ArcB ( an ArcB lacking the two transmembrane portions in the N-terminal region ) and ArcA for the purpose of testing ( i ) whether ArcB undergoes autophosphorylation at both His and Asp residues and ( ii ) whether an Asp residue of ArcA can receive a phosphoryl group from ArcB-P .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>Depending on aerobic conditions , ArcA is capable of receiving a phosphoryl group from either the catalytic core or the His-containing phosphotransfer ( HPt ) domain of ArcB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10966457" target="_blank">10966457</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the hybrid kinase ArcB , either His-containing domain ( the dimerization domain or the HPt ) can be phosphorylated from ATP and can donate phosphoryl groups to the RR ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10966457" target="_blank">10966457</a>]<br></li>
<li>The conserved His at position 292 in the sensor domain and the three conserved Asp residues at positions 533 , 576 , and 624 ( Fig. 7 ) suggest that the phosphoryl group at His could be transferred intramolecularly to the regulator domain of ArcB itself and/or to one of the three conserved Asp residues of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2201868" target="_blank">2201868</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , ArcA is a typical regulator protein , with only the receiver-domain containing conserved Asp residues at positions 11 and 54 as potential sites for transphosphorylation by phosphorylated ArcB ( ArcB-P ) ( 4 , 20 ) .

<li>To test whether both a His ( presumably at position 292 in the conserved transmitter domain ) and an Asp ( presumably at position 533 or 576 in the conserved receiver-domain ) of ` ArcB are autophosphorylated and whether only an Asp ( presumably at position 11 or 54 in the conserved receiver-domain ) of ArcA is phosphorylated , we took advantage of the known acidic lability and the alkaline stability of the phosphate link to His in contrast to the instability of the phosphate link to Asp under both conditions ( 5 , 26 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1512197" target="_blank">1512197</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the physiological role of the C-terminal domain is still unknown , the ArcB internal-receiverdomain must be phosphorylated by the kinase domain before transphosphorylation of ArcA can take place ( luchi and Lin , 1992a , b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8809780" target="_blank">8809780</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA , on the other hand , is a cytoplasmic response regulator that is activated for transcriptional control by phosphorylation of an aspartyl residue in its receiver module domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8824175" target="_blank">8824175</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since both ArcB and CpxA are expected to communicate with ArcA , it is tempting to suggest that this region plays a particularly important role in the interaction with the cognate regulator domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2201868" target="_blank">2201868</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA is a component of the ArcBA two-component signal transduction system , with the membrane-associated ArcB tripartite sensor kinase comprising a transmitter domain , a receiver-domain and a phosphotransfer domain ( Ishige et al. , 1994 ; Lin & Iuchi , 1991 ) .

<li>ArcB is the membrane sensor comprising both a transmitter domain and a receiver-domain , and ArcA is the cognate regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8132465" target="_blank">8132465</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this context , it may be significant that ArcB contains a car-boxy-terminal regulator domain resembling ArcA , as well as a typical sensor domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1957353" target="_blank">1957353</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is also possible that the ArcB regulator domain interacts with ArcA so that the phosphorylated product is different from that of CpxA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2201868" target="_blank">2201868</a>]<br></li>

<li>Moreover , while the VirG and ArcA DNA-binding domains cluster fairly closely to each other in the Fig. 6 tree , the PetR domain has a receiver module that clusters with VirG in Fig. 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7699720" target="_blank">7699720</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , it is possible that in the unphosphorylated state , the amino-terminal receiver-domain of ArcA acts as an inhibitory domain which blocks the carboxy-terminal DNA-binding region from site speciﬁcally interacting with DNA .

<li>Alternatively , phosphorylation of the receiver-domain of ArcA may result in a conformational change which facilitates oligomerization of the protein and consequent adoption of a site-speciﬁc DNA-binding mode .

<li>On the basis of additional homology within the carboxy-terminal domain , TorR has been recognized as a member of the OmpR subfamily of response regulators , which includes numerous members in E. coil ( such as ArcA , OmpR , or PhoB ) but also in many other bacterial species ( Aiba et aL , 1993 ; Mills et aL , 1993 ; Nagasawa et aL , 1993 ; Parkinson and Kofoid , 1992 ) .

<li>It is perhaps not surprising that , as a regulator of genes that have fundamental roles in bacterial physiology , ArcB should integrate the response to multiple signals ( e.g. ubiquinone , menaquinone , acetate , and other fermentation products ) ; however , the inverse linear correlation between ArcA activity and aerobiosis suggests that , at least under the conditions used here , the rate of fermentation product synthesis ( qacetate ) exerts a greater influence on ArcA activity than the redox state of the quinone pools .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21252224" target="_blank">21252224</a>]<br></li>
<li>The corresponding regulator is ArcA ( gene product of arcA ) , which acts as a repressor under such conditions ( Iuchi & Lin 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1854188" target="_blank">1854188</a>]<br></li>
<li>The cytoplasmatic ArcA regulator of the ArcAB system ( encoded by the arcA gene , previously known as dye , sfrA , fexA , msp , or seg ( see reference 15 and references therein ) has a pleiotropic effect on a number of cellular functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12486057" target="_blank">12486057</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA is the regulator component of a two-oomponent signai transduction system , which also comprises a histidine kincise called AroB ( luohi and Lin , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>
<li>The response regulator ArcA , which acts as a microaerobic redox regulator , is part of a two-component regulatory system that includes ArcB , a histidine kinase ( Alexeeva et al. , 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849790" target="_blank">16849790</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , we discovered that ArcA , i.e. , the other response regulator served by ArcB , acts as a repressor for rpoS transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rather , ArcA acts as direct repressor at the rpoSp1 promoter even in the absence of ArcB , and ArcB acts as a sensor kinase that directly phosphorylates and thereby activates the response regulator RssB , which targets S for proteolysis .

<li>Model for signal-transduction by the Arc system , with special focus on the reactions leading to the phosphorylation of the response regulator , ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9286997" target="_blank">9286997</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA , on the other hand , is a cytoplasmic response regulator that is activated for transcriptional-control by phosphorylation of an aspartyl residue in its receiver module domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8824175" target="_blank">8824175</a>]<br></li>
<li>This also means that in the presence of a limited ArcB-P supply , RssB phosphorylation is exquisitely sensitive against even small changes in the concentration of competing ArcA ( but not vice versa ) , a feature that the cell may use to control RssB phosphorylation and thereby S proteolysis ( see below ; Fig. 6 ) .

<li>A mutant strain unable to synthesize the membrane-associated histidine kinase ( ArcB ) that has been proposed to activate ArcA showed the same phenotype as an arcA mutant strain , indicating that a functional ArcB protein is also required for wild-type , anaerobic pfl transcriptional activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1592804" target="_blank">1592804</a>]<br></li>
<li>The histidine sensor kinase ArcB not only phosphorylates ArcA , but also the S proteolytic targeting factor RssB , and thereby stimulates S proteolysis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>The histidine sensor kinase ArcB stimulates S proteolysis by a mechanism that involves phosphorylation of RssB but does not require ArcA As the arcB mutant is not affected in rpoS transcription , and in particular , ArcB is not required for ArcA-depen-dent repression of rpoS transcription in vivo ( Fig. 2A ) , strongly increased S levels in the arcB mutant ( Fig. 1 ) indicate that the histidine sensor kinase ArcB also plays a role in the post-transcriptional-control of S. Expression of a translational rpoS lacZ reporter fusion , which reflects rpoS transcriptional as well as translational control , exhibited similar effects of arcA and arcB mutations as the transcriptional fusion , indicating that ArcB does not affect rpoS translation ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has also been shown that metabolites associated with fermentation ( e.g. the reduced fermentation products acetate , D-lac-tate , pyruvate , and NADH ) inhibit the ability of ArcB to dephosphorylate ArcA ( 20 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21252224" target="_blank">21252224</a>]<br></li>

<li>In Escherichia coli two global transcriptional regulatory proteins , Crp and Cra , are known to control transcriptional responses to carbon availability [ 28 , 30 ] , while two other global regulators , Fnr and ArcA , control gene-expression in response to oxygen availability [ 14 , 15 ] .

<li>The acid resistant island including the gadE-mdtEF operon indeed is one of the acquired gene clusters in E. coli with different GC content from the rest of E. coli genome ; Third , the interplay between the H-NS mediated repression and ArcA mediated antagonizing of the repression is also observed in the case of another gene cydAB which is also involved in adapting E. coli to the microaerobic and anaerobic growth ( Govantes et al. , 2000 ) .

<li>The expression of F ( glcD-lacZ ) in this genetic background was no longer repressed under fermentative conditions , indicating that ArcA acts as an anaerobic repressor of the glc operon ( Fig. 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9880556" target="_blank">9880556</a>]<br></li>
<li>This latter result indicated that ArcA suppresses anaerobic hyb expression and that a further factor , which remains to be identiﬁed , is involved in controlling anaerobic induction of operon expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>
<li>As the redox state of the respiratory chain depends on the concentration of the terminal electron acceptor , the activity of the ArcB -- ArcA system is controlled by oxygen supply and is therefore crucially involved in the control of gene-expression during transition to anaerobic conditions ( Lynch and Lin 1996a ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16291649" target="_blank">16291649</a>]<br></li>
<li>As another transcription regulator that controls fatty-acid-metabolism , ArcA has been shown to strongly ( > 20-fold ) repress the expression of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase encoded by the fadB gene , and to weakly repress acyl-CoA dehydrogenase encoded by the fadE gene , under anaerobic conditions .

<li>Identification of Differential Gene Expression Patterns Resulting from Two-variable Perturbation Experiments To identify the global changes and adjustments of gene-expression patterns that facilitate a transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth conditions and to determine the effects of genotype on these gene-expression patterns , we analyzed E. coli gene-expression profiles obtained from cells cultured under aerobic ( O ) or anaerobic ( O ) growth conditions 2 2 and under anaerobic growth conditions in the presence ( O , 2 ArcA ) or absence ( O , ArcA ) of ArcA , the global regula-2 tory protein for anaerobic metabolism .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>The experimental cell-growth conditions were as follows : wild-type E. coli K12 strain ( ArcA ) cultured under aerobic conditions ( O2 Arc ) , wild-type E. coli K12 strain ( ArcA ) cultured under anaerobic conditions ( O2 Arc ) , and isogenic E. coli K12 strain lacking the arcA gene cultured under anaerobic conditions ( O2 Arc ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that ArcA has a negative effect on the expression of these genes during the transition from aerobic to microaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>
<li>Analogous studies on the role of ArcA showed that deletion of the a r c A gene or the presence of an arcA + multicopy plasmid had no significant effect on acnA-lacZ expression under aerobic conditions ( Fig. 5b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>Together , these results show that gene-expression changes are consistent with ArcA being active in ECOM4LA under aerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>Global gene-expression suggests that ArcA is active in ECOM4LA in aerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>In sum , a combination of ArcA and AppY antirepression of IscR function , lower levels of IscR , and weak repression by [ 2Fe-2S ] - IscR leads to increased PhyaA expression under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>hyaA In this study , we examined the roles of IscR , ArcA , and AppY in regulating the expression of the hyaA promoter under aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA , AppY , and IscR act combinatorially to control hyaA promoter expression levels under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>The residual anaerobic repression suggests that other regulators may either repress acnA under anaerobic conditions ( especially in the absence of ArcA ) or activate a c n A expression under aerobic conditions both in the presence and absence of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>FnrS is involved in gene regulation after the shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions , and its expression is activated by the transcription factors FNR and ArcA ( 20 , 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23980183" target="_blank">23980183</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA thus appears to function as a repressor of gltA expression during both aerobic and anaerobic growth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>]<br></li>
<li>This anaerobic response is modulated by the ArcA protein , which functions as a repressor of mdh gene-expression under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592446" target="_blank">7592446</a>]<br></li>
<li>In summary , the results presented here indicate that ArcA and Fnr regulatory proteins play a role in repression of the E. coli tpx gene under anaerobic growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10794600" target="_blank">10794600</a>]<br></li>
<li>A similar pattern of ArcA control was also seen for fumC-lacZ expression during aerobic and anaerobic cell-growth ( Fig. 2C and D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592392" target="_blank">7592392</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two transcriptional regulators , FNR and ArcA , control this anaerobic induction of gene-expression ( 35 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8376324" target="_blank">8376324</a>]<br></li>

<li>ArcA appears to function as an anaerobic activator of hernA gene-expression , while Fnr repression is dependent on ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071201" target="_blank">8071201</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the aerobic/anaerobic control of fumA and fumC gene-expression involves ArcA repression at both the fumA and fumC promoters , while Fnr regulates fumC at a distance from the fumA promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592392" target="_blank">7592392</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results of immunoblotting experiments also demonstrated that ArcA and Fnr regulatory proteins repressed thiol peroxidase gene-expression during anaerobic growth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10794600" target="_blank">10794600</a>]<br></li>
<li>The dual control of tpx gene-expression regulated by ArcA and Fnr proteins appears to provide maximum protection against the toxicity of oxidative stress during aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions .

<li>The aerobic/anaerobic control of sdhCDAB gene-expression is provided by the two cellular regulatory proteins , ArcA and Fnr -LCB- Table 3 , Fig , 3 ) , ArcA functions as a repressor of sc / / 7CD / \ S-operon expression under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7783618" target="_blank">7783618</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fnr represses sdhCDAB expression but oniy during anaerobic conditions , Wby does tbe aerobic/anaerobic control of sdhCDAB gene-expression require two regulators , ArcA and Fnr ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7783618" target="_blank">7783618</a>]<br></li>
<li>Possibly , the differences in anaerobic expression of the hya operon in glucose medium and glycerol medium reflect differences in the levels of expression of the appY gene and/or in the levels of phosphorylation of the ArcA protein during anaerobic growth in these two media .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071220" target="_blank">8071220</a>]<br></li>
<li>The second transcription factor involved in oontrolling anaerobic gene-expression is the ArcA protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565118" target="_blank">7565118</a>]<br></li>
<li>The second protein that regulates anaerobic gene-expression is ArcA , which was identified as being necessary for repressing expression of the succinate dehydrogenase gene under anaerobic conditions ( 13 ) .

<li>Evidence from tpx-lacZ expression and immunoblotting experiments in various genetic backgrounds clearly shows that ArcA and Fnr are involved in aerobic/anaerobic regulation of the E. coli tpx gene as anaerobic repressors .

<li>Apart from its positive role in sex factor functions ( 12 , 14 ) , this is only the second example of ArcA functioning as a transcriptional activator of aerobic or anaerobic gene-expression in E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1592804" target="_blank">1592804</a>]<br></li>

<li>ArcA is the regulatory protein of a two-component signal-transduction-system , ArcA-ArcB , involved in the anaerobic regulation of a number of genes of aerobic metabolism ( luchi and Lin , 1988 ; 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA , which is the regulatory protein of a two-component system , controls the activity of many E. coli genes which are repressed under anaerobic conditions ( reviewed in reference 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626294" target="_blank">8626294</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two regulators involved in adjusting the transcriptional rate of genes of E. coli shifting from aerobic to anaerobic growth have been identified : the fnr gene product and the two-component sensor-regulator system ArcB-ArcA .

<li>E. coli has two distinct regulators that control expression of the many genes involved in the aerobic-anaerobic shift : the ArcB/ArcA two-component system and FNR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li></div>
<li>These include CreB and PhoB of enteric bacteria which are responsive to cytoplasmic catabolite concentrations and extracellular inorganic phosphate , respectively ; OmpR of enteric bacteria , involved in responses to osmotic conditions ; VirG proteins of agrobacterial species , activators of the Ti or Ri plasmid-encoded virulence op-erons ; and ArcA , an E. coli activator of genes encoding proteins which function in aerobic metabolism .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7699720" target="_blank">7699720</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it appears that ArcA , either directly or indirectly , negatively regulates the transcription of the anaerobic b-oxidation pathway genes fadJ and fadI in the absence of oxygen .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of oxygen , ArcA is bound to its cognate sites acting to repress transcription of the fad regulon genes , even under non-inducing conditions ( without fatty acids ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>RESULTS ArcA downregulates the transcription of fatty-acid-transport genes under anaerobic conditions The expression of fadL , which encodes one of the outer-membrane-bound proteins involved in the uptake of fatty acids , is regulated by at least three transcription factors : Crp , OmpR and FadR ( Berg et al. , 2004 ; Busch & Saier , 2002 ; Clark & Cronan , 1996 ; DiRusso et al. , 1992 ; Cronan & Subrahmanyam , 1998 ; Higashitani et al. , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Gene expression proﬁles of deletion mutants ( DarcA , DfadR and DarcA/DfadR ) indicated that ( i ) ArcA is a major transcription factor for the transcriptional regulation of fatty acid metabolism in the absence of oxygen , and ( ii ) ArcA and FadR cooperatively regulate the fad regulon under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>The model presented here is supported by the following evidence : ( i ) FadR repression coincides with ArcA repression for the fatty-acid-metabolism under anaerobic conditions ; ( ii ) ArcA-P is a DNA-binding protein speciﬁc to the upstream of fad regulon genes involved in fatty-acid-metabolism of E. coli ; ( iii ) under anaerobic conditions , transcription of fad regulon genes is increased upon the inactivation of ArcA , whereas , under aerobic conditions , transcription of those genes is not affected by the inactivation of ArcA ; ( iv ) the fadR deletion affects both aerobic and anaerobic transcription of fad regulon genes ; and ( v ) under anaerobic conditions , the transcript levels of fad regulon genes are synergistically increased upon the deletion of both arcA and fadR .

<li>is required for the fully extended lifespan of the lipA and lpdA mutants ArcA is a transcription factor that suppresses the expression of genes involved in respiration and activates genes involved in fermentative metabolism , thus contributing to the adaptation of E. coli to hypoxic conditions ( Iuchi & Lin 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707865" target="_blank">20707865</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under fermentation conditions , it would be plausible that additional transcription factor ( s ) repress the genes for anaerobic fatty-acid-degradation because ( i ) E. coli is unable to utilize fatty acids as a carbon source without a ﬁnal electron acceptor , such as nitrate ( Campbell et al. , 2003 ) , and ( ii ) previous microarray studies have suggested that transcription of fadJ and fadI is repressed in the absence of oxygen , and that ArcA may be involved ( Covert et al. , 2004 ; Iuchi & Lin , 1988 ) .

<li>It is suggested FixK in R. meliloti , and the azurin genes that the cyd operon is activated by ( azu ) of Alcaligenes faecalis and A. deni - ArcA under microaerobic conditions trificans23 , which encode the blue-cop - and repressed by FNR under anaerobic per proteins thought to be involved in conditions , so that this dual control nitrite respiration and therefore likely allows cytochrome d oxidase synthesis to be induced anaerobically .

<li>TorC autoregulation is different from tor anaerobic control The torCAD operon is fully induced in anaerobiosis but , in contrast to all other known anaerobic respiratory systems , this control is mediated neither by FNR , a pleiotropic anae-robic regulator , nor by ArcA , a response regulator involved in redox control of numerous genes ( Simon et al. , 1994 ) .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9230919" target="_blank">9230919</a>]<br></li>
<li>Remarkably , anaerobic control is mediated neither by FNR , the general anaerobic regulator , nor by ArcA , another anaerobic global regulator ( luchi and Lin , 1988 ; Pascal et aL , 1984 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8596446" target="_blank">8596446</a>]<br></li>
<li>Adaptation to anaerobic growth is regulated by two global transcription factors , FNR ( fumarate and nitrate reductase regulator ) and ArcA ( anaerobic respiratory control ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16417494" target="_blank">16417494</a>]<br></li>

<li>This indicates that ArcA probably functions as an anaerobic repressor of acnA transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>

<li>Activated ArcB undergoes a phosphorelay of His292 to Asp576 to His717 , and subsequently activates its cognate transcriptional regulator ArcA by phosphorylating ArcA at Asp54 to repress genes contributing to aerobic metabolism ( e.g. citrate synthase and isocitrate lyase ) and activates genes necessary for anaerobic metab-olism ( e.g. pyruvate formate lyase and hydrogenase ) [ 23,25,30-34 ] .

<li>Thus , it is conceivable that an ArcA oligomer ( which is known to form upon phosphorylation [ Jeon et al. 2001 ] ) binds to both sites and thereby may induce the formation of a DNA loop that includes the rpoSp1 promoter sequence .

<li>In parallel , the role of ArcA changes to that of an agonist of S , as it becomes part of a positive feedback that further stabilizes S ; arcA expression increases in a partially S-dependent manner ( Fig. 6A , B ) , and ArcA plays a positive role in S stabilization in starved cells ( Fig. 6C ) , as even small increases in ArcA concentration efficiently interfere with RssB phosphorylation by ArcB ( especially when phosphorylated ArcB is in reduced supply as in cells that enter into an energy starvation situation ) .

<li>Therefore , it is not possible to locate potential ArcA-binding sites by sequence analysis , although it is presumed that dctA is directly repressed by ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10482502" target="_blank">10482502</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , most of the genes in group III are repressed by the O2-sensing system mediated by ArcA ( 49 , 70 ) , and although not directly demonstrated , the data in this paper suggest that these genes can also be repressed by FNR .

<li>Expressionfrom the suc promoter was repressed by IHF and partially activated by d8but it was not regulated by ArcA , FNR , CRP , FruR or Fis , and not repressed by glucose or anaerobiosis , indicating that the well-established catabolite and anaerobic repression of ODH synthesis is imposed elsewhere .

<li>Incontrast , the / pel promoter was repressed by both glucose ( via a CRP-independentmechanism ) and anaerobiosis ( mediated by ArcA ) , and activated by Fis , but it was not regulated by FNR , FruR , IHF or These observations support the view that transcription of the sucABCD genes is primarily initiated and regulated at the upstream sdh promoter , and that the Ipd promoter is independently co-regulated with Pdh ( primarily by ArcAmediated repression ) rather than with PsucDirect evidence for co-transcription of the entire sdhCDAksucABCD region from PHNw t as obtained by detecting a 10 kb transcript inm c and me mutants , but not inthe parental strains .

<li>Regulation of acnB gene transcription Apart from being activated by CRP and repressed by ArcA , the acnB gene exhibited a very different pattern of regulation to that of acnA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>]<br></li>
<li>Further studies with acn-lac2 gene fusions and a wider range of transcription regulators indicated that acnA expression is initiated by G ~ ~ from PIacnAa , nd from PZacnA it is activated directly or indirectly by CRP , FruR , Fur and SoxRS , and repressed by ArcA and FNR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>]<br></li>

<li>As shown in Figure 7 , as expected , transcription of PicdA-lacZ and PlpdA-lacZ fusions were signiﬁcantly repressed by ArcA under anaerobic condition , since arcA caused de-repression of their transcription under anaerobic condition in M9 glucose medium , the same condition used in this study .

<li>For example , all the fad genes repressed by FadR are also repressed by the ArcA transcription factor ( encoded by arcA ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23026122" target="_blank">23026122</a>]<br></li>
<li>We observed signiﬁcant downregulation of the sdhABCD ( succinate dehydrogenase ) and frdABCD operons , known to be repressed by ArcA , under oxic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of oxygen , ArcA is bound to its cognate sites acting to repress transcription of the fad regulon genes , even under non-inducing conditions ( without fatty-acids ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>More recently , another transcription factor , IscR , has been shown to directly repress the hyaA promoter ( PhyaA ) but only under aerobic conditions when ArcA and AppY are not active ( 14 , 28 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of both of these operons has been shown to be induced under low-oxygen conditions ( 8 , 9 ) and to be activated by the ArcA transcription factor ( 3 , 8 ) ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19734316" target="_blank">19734316</a>]<br></li>

<li>Expression of the E. cofipfloperon is induced by anae-robiosis ( Sawers and B6ck , 1988 ; 1989 ) and regulation is mediated by Fnr functioning in conjunction with the ArcA transcription factor ( for a review see luchi and Lin , 1993 ) .

<li>Data from Cotter and Gunsalus ( 1992 ) showing that fnr transcription is not activated by ArcA seem to exclude an indirect effect mediated by Fnr , It is possible that there is an ArcA feedback loop , but only when a threshold concentration of ArcA protein is reached .

<li>TorC autoregulation is different from tor anaerobic control The torCAD operon is fully induced in anaerobiosis but , in contrast to all other known anaerobic respiratory systems , this control is mediated neither by FNR , a pleiotropic anae-robic regulator , nor by ArcA , a response regulator involved in redox control of numerous genes ( Simon et al. , 1994 ) .

<li>The expression of the appY gene is induced immediately by anaerobiosis , and this anaerobic induction is independent of Fnr , and AppY , but dependent on ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>We found that the anaerobic induction of the appY gene was independent of Fnr and AppY but dependent on ArcA ( Table 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of adhE is about 10-fold higher during anaerobic than during aerobic growth , and this regulation is independent of ArcA and Fnr .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10601216" target="_blank">10601216</a>]<br></li>

Nesbit , * A. S. Fleischhacker , S. J. Teter , and P. J. Kiley Department of Biomolecular Chemistry , University of Wisconsin , Madison , Wisconsin , USA Transcription of the Escherichia coli hydrogenase-1 operon ( hyaABCDEF ) is increased by the transcription factors ArcA and AppY under anaerobic growth conditions .

<li>The anaerobic transcription of the hydrogenase 1 operon is activated by ArcA and AppY , which seem to act independently .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA and AppY activated transcription of the cyx-appA operon during entry into stationary phase and under anaerobic growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results indicate that both AppY and ArcA are involved in activating the transcription of the hya operon during anaerobic growth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071220" target="_blank">8071220</a>]<br></li>
<li>During anaerobic growth , ArcA represses transcription of several genes involved in aerobic metabolism , including the cyo operon ( 23 ) , and activates transcription of the pfl gene ( 35 ) and the cyd operon ( 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071219" target="_blank">8071219</a>]<br></li>
<li>During anaerobic growth , ArcA represses transcription of several genes involved in aerobic metabolism ( 17 ) and activates transcription of the pyruvate formate-lyase ( pfl ) gene ( 30 ) as well as the cytochrome d oxidase ( cydAB ) operon ( 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071220" target="_blank">8071220</a>]<br></li>
<li>In those studies , it was suggested that ArcA represses fadK transcription under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA is the major regulator of aerobic metabolism and represses the genes of aerobic metabolism under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9230919" target="_blank">9230919</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA appears to repress mdh transcription under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions , as has also been shown for the gltA and sdhCDAB TCA genes ( 16 , 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592446" target="_blank">7592446</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , we found that during anaerobic growth the transcription of the appY gene was activated by ArcA ( Table 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>One possibility is that H-NS is inactive under anaerobic conditions and it disassembles from the gadE promoter , allowing ArcA which is active under this condition to bind the promoter of gadE and initiate gene transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>As a result , uvrA expression was remarkably repressed by induction of ArcA with arabinose ( Fig. 1A ) , but in the arcA and arcB-defective strains , it increased more than in the wild-type strain ( Fig. 1B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140472" target="_blank">16140472</a>]<br></li>
<li>Other operons controlled by ArcA , such as lct ( encoding the flavin-linked L-lactate dehydrogenase ) , exhibited expression patterns similar to that of sdh ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1851949" target="_blank">1851949</a>]<br></li>

<li>When cells were grown aerobically or anaerobically , expression in an arcA de-letion strain was essentially the same as in the wild-type strain : ArcA does not appear to regulate expression of aegA ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8955321" target="_blank">8955321</a>]<br></li>
<li>These apparent contradictions can be reconciled by our finding that ArcA represses fadL expression less than fadD expression ( only about 4-fold ) ( Fig. 8B and C ) and that FadK activates oleate poorly [ 35 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23029459" target="_blank">23029459</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , the apparent lack of ArcA regulation of fadK transcription was unexpected , given the previous studies that observed the expression of fadK to be induced by oxygen limitation ( Campbell et al. , 2003 ; Morgan-Kiss & Cronan , 2004 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA has been shown to negatively regulate arcB mRNA levels , particularly at low oxygen , ( Shalel-Levanon et al , 2005 ) ; based on our observations ( anaerobic conditions ) , it represses arcZ expression , therefore allowing higher ArcB expression and thus its own activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results are in contrast to previous works that reported that Fnr represses ndh expression while ArcA induces it ( Meng et al. , 1997 ; Liu and De Wulf , 2004 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , it was previously suggested that ArcA represses nuoA expression ( Bongaerts et al. , 1995 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>
<li>RESULTS ArcA downregulates the transcription of fatty acid transport genes under anaerobic conditions The expression of fadL , which encodes one of the outer-membrane-bound proteins involved in the uptake of fatty-acids , is regulated by at least three transcription factors : Crp , OmpR and FadR ( Berg et al. , 2004 ; Busch & Saier , 2002 ; Clark & Cronan , 1996 ; DiRusso et al. , 1992 ; Cronan & Subrahmanyam , 1998 ; Higashitani et al. , 1993 ) .

<li>is required for the fully extended lifespan of the lipA and lpdA mutants ArcA is a transcription factor that suppresses the expression of genes involved in respiration and activates genes involved in fermentative metabolism , thus contributing to the adaptation of E. coli to hypoxic conditions ( Iuchi & Lin 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707865" target="_blank">20707865</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our studies suggest that neither CRP nor ArcA is this transcription factor even though a previous study indicated that expression of fnr is slightly higher ( approximately twofold ) in ArcA cells under microaerobic growth conditions ( 49 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17293415" target="_blank">17293415</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA ANTAGONIZES THE H-NS MEDIATED REPRESSION OF gadE-mdtEF DURING THE TRANSITION FROM AEROBIC TO ANAEROBIC GROWTH Our results above showed that the expression of gadE-mdtEF is largely repressed by the DNA silencer H-NS under aerobic conditions in M9 glucose medium , whereas under anaerobic condition in the same medium its expression is activated primarily in an ArcA dependent manner .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>Despite the activation of the repressors ArcA and FNR by the withdrawal of oxygen in the aerobic -- anaerobic transition , ndh expression did not decrease ( figure 6b ) , consistent with the microarray data ( figure 4c ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>It seems that the expression level of ndh was independent of the ArcA and FNR regulators as the expression levels were similar in all strains .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140031" target="_blank">16140031</a>]<br></li>

<li>Transcription of ndh is repressed by FNR [ 38 ] and gene expression profiling suggests that it is activated by ArcA [ 39 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also regulation of the expression of puuA was not fully reported except that the regulation of puuA occurring in response to O2 was mediated by ArcA and FNR ( 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18495664" target="_blank">18495664</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to regulation by ArcA and FNR , ndh expression is repressed by the pyruvate-responsive TF PdhR ; repression is relieved by pyruvate [ 40 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22870390" target="_blank">22870390</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that H-NS has the potential to regulate cydAB expression negatively in both aerobiosis and anaerobiosis , but ArcA antagonizes its action in the absence of oxygen .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11123679" target="_blank">11123679</a>]<br></li>

<li>We then measured the level of transcription of acs by RT-PCR and found that lack of ArcA results in elevated expression of the gene in both the lipA and wt strains ( Figure 1D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20707605" target="_blank">20707605</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , ArcA represses sodA transcription in anaerobiosis , coupling its expression to aerobic respiration ( 56 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20075074" target="_blank">20075074</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , the transcription of glpF and glpK is regulated by CRP and GlpR , whereas the expression of glpD is regulated by CRP , GlpR and ArcA , as proposed elsewhere [ 1,5 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22513097" target="_blank">22513097</a>]<br></li>
<li>MraZ activates the expression of both fadB and fadE when overexpressed early in the highly aerobic log phase , when ArcA is not phosphorylated and is inactive as a repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24659771" target="_blank">24659771</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under aerobic conditions , ArcA + in a fur - fnr + background allowed for higher expression of sodA-lacZ ( compare NC439 vs. NC417 ; Table 3 , column 3 ) , while this was not the case in afur-fnr - background ( compare NC412 and NC419 ; Table 3 , column 3 ) .

<li>Taken together with the expression data discussed above , it is clear that ArcA directly represses gene expression of fadJ and fadI by binding to their promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together with the expression data discussed above , the results indicate that ArcA directly represses the gene expression of fadL and fadD by binding to the promoter regions under anaerobic conditions .

<li>The corresponding regulator is ArcA ( gene product of arcA ) , which acts as a repressor under such conditions ( Iuchi & Lin 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1854188" target="_blank">1854188</a>]<br></li>
<li>This was accomplished by the use of DNA microarrays to analyze gene expression profiles in E. coli cells cultured at steady-state growth rates under aerobic ( O2 ) or anaerobic ( O2 ) growth 84 This paper is available on line at http://www.jbc.org conditions and in cells cultured under anaerobic growth conditions in the presence ( O , ArcA ) or absence ( O , ArcA ) of 2 2 the ArcA protein or in otherwise arcA and arcA isogenic strains .

<li>The experimental cell growth conditions were as follows : wild-type E. coli K12 strain ( ArcA ) cultured under aerobic conditions ( O2 Arc ) , wild-type E. coli K12 strain ( ArcA ) cultured under anaerobic conditions ( O2 Arc ) , and isogenic E. coli K12 strain lacking the arcA gene cultured under anaerobic conditions ( O2 Arc ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>These experiments show that about one-half of the genes whose expression levels are affected by aerobic to anaerobic transitions are also affected by the ArcA protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results of the gene expression profiling experiments further show that as many as two-thirds of the genes whose expression levels are affected by the ArcA protein are also affected by the FNR protein ( 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that aerobic expression is also reduced in the arcA mutant ( Table 1 ) indicates that ArcA is also involved in aerobic expression of pﬂ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7665524" target="_blank">7665524</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that the control of this promoter was independent of ArcA and Fnr ( Table 4 ) suggests that the prior observation by Iuchi et al. ( 9 ) that an arcA mutant was elevated for a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity when grown under anaerobic conditions is accounted for by the regulated expression of the sucAB genes from the upstream sdhC promoter .

<li>Expression Pattern IV : Increased Expression during Anaerobiosis and No Change in an ArcA Strain -- The six genes of this cluster ( Table IV ) showed elevated expression under anaerobic growth conditions , but were not affected by deletion of the arcA allele .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>Deletion of the arcA gene caused about a 2-fold increase in the ptsG expression , and overexpression of ArcA significantly decreased glucose consumption .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15252051" target="_blank">15252051</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this study , uvrA gene expression was repressed when ArcA was induced in E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16140472" target="_blank">16140472</a>]<br></li>
<li>Only one gene in this expression pattern , glcC , was also identified in the study by Liu and De Wulf ( 22 ) ; however , their results indicated that glcG is repressed by ArcA ( 2.6-fold ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the aerobic/anaerobic control of fumA and fumC gene expression involves ArcA repression at both the fumA and fumC promoters , while Fnr regulates fumC at a distance from the fumA promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592392" target="_blank">7592392</a>]<br></li>
<li>This control is complex : it involves action by ArcA and Fnr as negative regulators of fumA and fumC expression from the fumA promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592392" target="_blank">7592392</a>]<br></li>

<li>The remaining gene , frdB , is a member of pattern VII ( decreased expression during anaerobiosis and decreased expression in a ArcA strain ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>

<li>The ArcA control of fumC gene expression is also complex : it requires the combined interactions of ArcA at both the fumA and fumC promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7592392" target="_blank">7592392</a>]<br></li>
<li>By contrast , the recently observed Fnr-dependent control of arcA gene expression has subjected models for Fnr and ArcA control of gene expression to reevaluation ( 3 , 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>

<li>Thus , for maximum aerobic expression of the sodA gene both ArcA and Fnr must be present , while Fur must be absent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>A mechanism for Fnr control of icd gene expression is less clear than for the ArcA protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9209047" target="_blank">9209047</a>]<br></li>

<li>As another transcription regulator that controls fatty acid metabolism , ArcA has been shown to strongly ( > 20-fold ) repress the expression of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase encoded by the fadB gene , and to weakly repress acyl-CoA dehydrogenase encoded by the fadE gene , under anaerobic conditions .

<li>Apart from its positive role in sex factor functions ( 12 , 14 ) , this is only the second example of ArcA functioning as a transcriptional activator of aerobic or anaerobic gene expression in E. coli .

<li>ArcA , when activated , can then bind to regulatory DNA sites to mediate both positive and negative control of gene expression ( 8 , 9 ) : cyo-ABCDE expression is repressed under anaerobic conditions , while cydAB expression is activated ( 3 , 4 , 8 ) .

<li>In summary , the results presented here indicate that ArcA and Fnr regulatory proteins play a role in repression of the E. coli tpx gene under anaerobic growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10794600" target="_blank">10794600</a>]<br></li>
<li>The differences observed in tpx gene expression during aerobic vs. anaerobic growth conditions were also reported for several tricarboxylic acid cycle genes , including sdhC , gltA , mdh , and for some respiratory pathway genes , frdABCD , dmsABC , narGHJI although the molecular basis for this ArcA - and Fnr-independent control is not understood ( 17 ) .

<li>Summary The ArcA and Fnr regulators of Escherichia coii , both of which are activated in anaerobic conditions , negatively regulate the sodA gene ( coding for manganese superoxide dismutase ) , but Fnr has no effect on anaerobic sodA expression in a \ arcAAfnr background ( Compan and Touati , 1993 ) .

<li>The ArcA and Fnr proteins provide anaerobic control of sucA expression at a distance as revealed by analysis of the larger sdhCDAB-sucA-lacZ fusion ( Fig. 2 , Table 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9209026" target="_blank">9209026</a>]<br></li>
<li>The aerobic and anaerobic control of gltA4-lacZ expression is due primarily to the arcA gene product ( Table 4 ; Fig. 5 ) , whereas sdhCDAB gene expression is controlled by both ArcA and Fnr ( 25 ) .

<li>In contrast to the aerobic increase in FumA and FumC activities , FumB is more abundant under anaerobic conditions and fumB gene expression requires ArcA and Fnr as transcriptional activators ( Tseng , 1997 ) .

<li>Fnr represses sdhCDAB expression but oniy during anaerobic conditions , Wby does tbe aerobic/anaerobic control of sdhCDAB gene expression require two regulators , ArcA and Fnr ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7783618" target="_blank">7783618</a>]<br></li>
<li>The dual control of tpx gene expression regulated by ArcA and Fnr proteins appears to provide maximum protection against the toxicity of oxidative stress during aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions .

<li>The extent of ArcA control of gitA and sdhCDAB gene expression under aerobic conditions is in marked contrast to the lack of Fnr control under the same conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8051021" target="_blank">8051021</a>]<br></li>
<li>The aerobic/anaerobic control of sdhCDAB gene expression is provided by the two cellular regulatory proteins , ArcA and Fnr -LCB- Table 3 , Fig , 3 ) , ArcA functions as a repressor of sc / / 7CD / \ S-operon expression under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7783618" target="_blank">7783618</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , aerobic expression of the focA gene was reduced by the p6A mutation , as was the dependence on ArcA for anaerobic induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9084161" target="_blank">9084161</a>]<br></li>
<li>Aerobic expression was also reduced partially by Fnr and ArcA control anaerobic induction of focA the p6-2 mutation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9084161" target="_blank">9084161</a>]<br></li>

<li>The results clearly demonstrate that ArcA represses expression of arcZ during anaerobic growth , the expected condition for ArcA to be active .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20683441" target="_blank">20683441</a>]<br></li>
<li>Possibly , the differences in anaerobic expression of the hya operon in glucose medium and glycerol medium reflect differences in the levels of expression of the appY gene and/or in the levels of phosphorylation of the ArcA protein during anaerobic growth in these two media .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071220" target="_blank">8071220</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA protein , the product of the arcA gene , is known to repress the expression of many genes of E. coli that are not required for anaerobic growth ( 23 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA represses anaerobic gene expression in E. coli ( 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14996819" target="_blank">14996819</a>]<br></li>
<li>It was also concluded that any involvement of FNR must be indirect ( or operational only in the absence of ArcA ) , because a c n A expression was not enhanced in an fnr mutant , but it was partially repressed under aerobic conditions by fnr + amplification in an arcA + strain ( Gruer & Guest , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been reported that FNR is able to sense oxygen directly ( 47 ) , while the ArcB/ArcA system responds to the content of the quinone pool ( 4 , 5 , 17 ) and switches on the expression of fermentation genes and represses aerobic pathways when E. coli encounters low-oxy-gen growth conditions ( 21 , 22 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20709841" target="_blank">20709841</a>]<br></li>
<li>This residual induction was imparted by ArcA , since no anaerobic induction occurred when expression from this mutant promoter derivative was examined in a strain that can not synthesize ArcA -LCB- Fig. 4C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7934836" target="_blank">7934836</a>]<br></li>
<li>These include sev - ArcA because the anaerobic induction eral of the symbiotic N2-fixation genes of cyd expression is significantly re - ( fix ) , which are probably regulated by duced in an arcA mutant .

<li>not regulated by ArcA but expression is activated by a novel regulator , Arr , which responds to the presence of amino acids during anaerobic growth ( Green & Guest , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9308170" target="_blank">9308170</a>]<br></li>
<li>Cho and coworkers [ 12 ] initially used quantitative RT-PCR to assay regulation of fadL and fadD by FadR and ArcA under anaerobic conditions and reported that deletion of either arcA , fadR alone , or both arcA and fadR resulted in increased fadL expression by 34 - , 4 - or 69-fold , respectively , whereas fadD transcription increased 69 - , 4.5 - , and 84-fold .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23029459" target="_blank">23029459</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA DIRECTLY BINDS TO MULTIPLE SITES AT THE gadE PROMOTER TO ACTIVATE THE EXPRESSION OF THE gadE-mdtEF Since ArcA and MnmE were identiﬁed as transcription activators of the gadE-mdtEF operon , we next asked how these two regulators activate gadE expression , i.e. , through which promoters these two regulators affect the transcription of the gadE-mdtEF operon under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , the lldPRD operon is proposed to be under the control of the global regulator ArcA , which binds to positions 14 to 3 with respect to the transcriptional start site , corresponding to the proposed P2 promoter , and represses the expression of this operon under anaerobic conditions ( 13 ) .

<li>3474 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ArcA and FNR are required for complete anaerobic pfl operon expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1592804" target="_blank">1592804</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggested that anaerobic expression of the gadE-mdtEF operon is primarily regulated by ArcA in both log phase and stationary phase under anaerobic condition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874328" target="_blank">23874328</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA and AppY had no effect on PhyaA expression under aerobic conditions , as expected ( Fig. 1C ) , since ArcA is not active aerobically and since AppY is poorly expressed under these growth conditions ( 1 , 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consistent with the notion that PhyaA expression is regulated by IscR repression aerobically and by ArcA and AppY antirepression of IscR anaerobically , PhyaA-lacZ expression levels in the absence of any transcription factors were similar under anaerobic and aerobic conditions ( Fig. 1A and C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA alone appears to slightly repress PhyaA under anaerobic conditions , since a strain containing deletions of appY and iscR ( ArcA ) showed an intermediate expression level ( Fig. 1A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>The residual anaerobic repression suggests that other regulators may either repress acnA under anaerobic conditions ( especially in the absence of ArcA ) or activate a c n A expression under aerobic conditions both in the presence and absence of ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , under anaerobic conditions , the expression of fadK is independent of FadR and ArcA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16849788" target="_blank">16849788</a>]<br></li>
<li>ArcA , AppY , and IscR act combinatorially to control hyaA promoter expression levels under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>Other than its effect on the rpoS regulon , CsgD expression appears to regulate a subset of anaerobiosis-dependent genes , such as ompW and pﬂB , both induced in anaerobic conditions by FNR , either alone or in concert with ArcA ( 18 , 61 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17873038" target="_blank">17873038</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this same report , FNR and IHF were reported to have roles as weak repressors under anaerobic conditions , and it was suggested that the effect of FNR may be indirect as a consequence of its role in regulating ArcA expression ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12754220" target="_blank">12754220</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , it was reported recently that ArcA and FNR repressed the expression of puuA when E. coli was grown under anaerobic conditions and that there are putative binding motifs of ArcA and FNR upstream of the open reading frame of puuA ( 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18495664" target="_blank">18495664</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rather , hya expression in S. enterica is regulated not by IscR or ArcA but , rather , by FNR under anaerobic conditions ( 38 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>

<li>Expression of cyd is thus stimulated by ArcA under microaerobic conditions and repressed by FNR unde anaerobic conditions , resulting in a maximal expression under microaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11931557" target="_blank">11931557</a>]<br></li>
<li>tpx has been reported to be negatively regulated by ArcA ( Kim et al , 1999 ) ; as regulation by ArcZ is also negative , this regulatory circuit would suggest interlocking mechanisms for keeping tpx expression relatively low under most conditions ; it would be transcriptionally repressed under anaerobic growth conditions by ArcA , and translationally repressed under aerobic conditions by ArcZ .

<li>In contrast , the gatZYABC operon , negatively controlled by CsgD ( 10 ) ( Table 2 ) is repressed by ArcA in anaerobic conditions ( 60 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17873038" target="_blank">17873038</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of F ( glcD-lacZ ) in this genetic background was no longer repressed under fermentative conditions , indicating that ArcA acts as an anaerobic repressor of the glc operon ( Fig. 3B ) .

<li>The immediate response to anaerobiosis of the hydrogenase 1 operon and of the appY gene could be mediated by ArcA alone .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>The pfl operon is one of only a few whose expression is regulated positively in response to anaerobiosis by ArcA .

<li>The dual pattern of hemA gene regulation by the Fnr and ArcA regulatory proteins is similar to that seen for the genes for cytochrome d oxidase in E. coli ( Table 3 ) , where Fnr functions to repress cydAB gene expression while ArcA somehow functions to activate their expression ( 6 , 10 ) .

<li>However , from the present study , it is apparent that Fnr and ArcA can act relatively independently of one another to negatively control icd expression ( Table 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9209047" target="_blank">9209047</a>]<br></li>

<li>To determine whether ArcA-dependent Fnr repression of sodA was produced by Fnr activation of arcA transcription , we have investigated the effects of Fnr and ArcA on arcA expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022271" target="_blank">8022271</a>]<br></li>
<li>Anaerobic induction of operon expression is dependent on the ArcA and Fnr transcription factors ( 10 , 12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7665524" target="_blank">7665524</a>]<br></li>
<li>Aerobic expression was independent of ArcA and Fnr , but induction of cydDC by nitrate and nitrite was dependent on NarL and Fnr .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9335308" target="_blank">9335308</a>]<br></li>
<li>Remarkably , in an arcA mutant , expression was derepressed aerobically , indicating that ArcA and Fnr are both involved in regulating this promoter , even when upstream regulatory sequences are missing .

<li>In addition , P1 - and P2-indepen-dent transcription is regulated , albeit weakly , by Fnr and ArcA The cydAB operon is transcribed from multiple promoters To identify other putative promoters for the cydAB operon , total RNA from anaerobically grown lPC64 , lFER20 , lFER94 and lFER95 lysogens was prepared , and the transcript profile of the cydAB promoter element was analysed in primer extension experiments ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10998176" target="_blank">10998176</a>]<br></li>
<li>The focA ± pfl operon is also co-ordinately regulated by ArcA and Fnr ( although both proteins act as activators ) and is also transcribed from multiple ( seven ) promoters ( Sawers and BoÈck , 1989 ; Sawers , 1993 ; Drapal and Sawers , 1995 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10998176" target="_blank">10998176</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although it has been reported that cyd operon is regulated by the interdependency of Cra , Fnr , and ArcA ( Ramseier et al. 1996 ) , the down-regulation of this operon was due to Cra in the present case since fnr and arcA changed little for the continuous culture at the present aerobic condition .

<li>The cydA , B operon is known to be controlled by ArcA and Fnr in response to oxygen limitation , and also controlled by Cra by carbon source availability ( Ramseier et al. 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18648770" target="_blank">18648770</a>]<br></li>
<li>The cydAB operon , encoding the two protein constituents of the Cyd complex , is known to be controlled at the transcriptional level by both ArcA and Fnr in response to oxygen availability [ 6 , 7 , 10 ] .
