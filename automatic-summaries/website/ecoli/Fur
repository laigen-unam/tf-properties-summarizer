				<div class="ACT"><br><ul><li>When FeFur , first incubated with pDT10 , was exposed to three equivalents of NO via DEANO , the 1,781-bp fragment was totally cleaved and generated the 1,530 - and 251-bp fragments , suggesting direct inactivation of FeFur by NO .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>This EPR signal is associated to the presence of the FeFur -- NO complex inside the cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>FeFur Is Sensitive to NO in Vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>To specify the interaction between NO and FeFur , we recorded EPR and UV-visible spectra .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>The solution was frozen in liquid nitrogen before it was added to concentrated FeFur solution ( 6 mM , 50 l ) in anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>The addition of NO gas to an anaerobic solution of FeFur resulted in immediate change from colorless to yellow-green , associated to the appearance of absorption bands in the UV-visible spectra as well as a g 2.03 EPR signal .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>The addition of NO by using NO gas resulted in the immediate complexation of NO with FeFur , yielding a species stable in anaerobic conditions that stood during 1 h in aerobiosis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent data concerning the nature of the ligands coordinated to iron in FeFur are much more in agreement with the environments in these compounds .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>

<li>They are involved in processes as diverse as respiration , gene regulation , cofactor biosynthesis , and DNA-RNA metabolism .7 There is tremendous interest in understanding the mechanisms of Fe-S cluster biosynthesis , one reason being that several human diseases , including Friedreich 's ataxia , are the result of genetic defects in the protein machinery that makes Fe-S clusters .7 10.1021 / pr100920r 2010 American Chemical Society 6740 Journal of Proteome Research 2010 , 9 , 6740 -- 6751 Published on Web 10/11/201 The SUF system of E. coli is comprised of complex protein machinery , which , under the control of OxyR , IHF , IscR , andFur , synthesizes Fe S clusters during the potentially cytotoxic conditions of iron limitation and oxidative-stress .6,11 -14 ,17,18 The SUF system is encoded by the sufABCDSE operon .14 SufS is a cysteine desulfurase that mobilizes inorganic sulfur via a pyridoxal-5 ′ - phosphate cofactor and a conserved cysteine ( C ) residue and transfers the sulfur atom through a proposed persulﬁde transfer mechanism to the conserved C51 residue on the sulfur acceptor protein SufE.19-21 SufB , SufC , and SufD form a complex ( SufBC2D , hereafter referred to as SufBCD ) 22 that stimulates this cysteine desulfurase activity through an unknown mechanism ,21 though SufC is known to be an atypical ABC transporter ATPase .12 In vitro evidence suggests that SufE transfers the sulfur atom to SufB within the SufBCD complex and that SufBCD acts as a scaffold upon which an Fe-S cluster is assembled.22-24 It is not known whether the persulﬁde sulfur on SufE is liberated via nucleophilic attack by the recipient Cys thiol on the terminal sulfur of the persulﬁde , which would result in persulﬁde transfer , or via nucleophilic attack on the bridging sulfur , which would produce a disulﬁde-linked complex between SufE and the recipient protein and liberate sulﬁde that may then bind a free Cys residue for use in assembling an Fe-S cluster .5 It also remains to be determined whether the assembled cluster on SufBCD is transferred to a target apoprotein directly or via SufA.22,25-27 It is possible that SufE transfers sulfur to proteins other than SufB , as both the iron source and the means by which the sulfur on SufE is incorporated into an Fe-S cluster remain unknown .

<li>Thus , we propose that the E. coli response to reactive nitrogen species is brought about by the modification of some transcription factors , such as NorR , that control the expression of NO detoxifying activities and are dedicated to sensing reactive nitrogen species , and other redoxactive transcription factors such as Fur , SoxR , and OxyR , where the reaction with reactive nitrogen species is incidental .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , Fur is activated by OxyR and SoxRS , regulators of the antioxidant defense response in E. coli , thereby reducing the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other toxic oxygen species through the Fenton reaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15878120" target="_blank">15878120</a>]<br></li>
<li>This finding that fur mutants , in which Fur target genes are constitutively derepressed , were hypersensitive to GSNO and NaNO2 is consistent with a prominent Fur role in the E. coli response to reactive nitrogen species , but seems contradictory to the observation that Fur target genes are derepressed on GSNO treatment .

<li>Our data suggest that the immediate increase in SOD activity made possible by the absence of the growth delay is an important ﬁrst-line defense against lethal UVA irradiation ; the absence of elevated SOD activity in Dfur strains under these same conditions can be explained by the fact that since Fur is known to regulate MnSOD and FeSOD [ 2 ] , the absence of the Fur gene product may be interfering with the signaling pathways leading to this response .

<li>In addition to being activated by the SoxRS oxidative-stress regulatory system , the acnA gene appeared to be activated by the ferric uptake regulator ( Fur ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the enzymatic activity of AcnB is lower than that of aconitase AcnA and the sequence homology covers only 17 % [ 49 ] , the protagonistic role of AcnA in at least four global regulatory pathways , cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) - mediated catabolite activation , ArcAmediated anaerobic repression , iron and Fur ( ferric uptake regulator ) - dependent activation and oxidative-stress regulatory system ( SoxRS ) activation , points to the possible effects of binding .

<li>In conclusion , the in vitro transcription experiments indicate that H-NS represses ftnA transcription directly , as reported for other H-NS-controlled genes ( Göransson et al. , 1990 ; Tupper et al. , 1994 ) , and that Fur acts directly as an antirepressor , reversing the effect of H-NS transcriptional silencing .

<li>Model to explain H-NS-mediated Fe2 + -- Fur activation of ftnA H-NS acts as a global repressor of transcription in E. coli and many other bacteria ( Westermark et al. , 2000 ; Hommais et al. , 2001 ; Grainger et al. , 2006 ; Lucchini et al. , 2006 ; Navarre et al. , 2006 ; Stoebel et al. , 2008 ) .

<li>This transport system is induced by the presence of ferric-dicitrate complexes and its expression is negatively controlled by the Fur repressor ( Staudenmaier et al. , 1989 ; Van Hove et al. , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7557462" target="_blank">7557462</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here , we present evidence that RyhB in turn represses translation of sodB , explaining the previously described positive control of sodB by Fur ( Niederhoffer et al. , 1990 ) , i.e. derepression of sodB in the presence of Fur and absence of RyhB .

<li>Fur is a 16.8-kDa protein rich in histidine ( Schäffer et al. 1985 ) that binds 1 mol of Fe2 + or Mn2 + per mol of protein ( De Lorenzo et al. 1987 , 1988 ; Escolar et al. 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9575233" target="_blank">9575233</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , gene expression of sufABCDSE is induced by H2O2 ( Zheng et al. 2001 ) , and oxidant induction of the suf operon is regulated by OxyR , IHF , Fur and IscR ( Lee et al. 2008 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19919618" target="_blank">19919618</a>]<br></li>
<li>d. Also regulated by Crp , IHF , Lrp , CpxR , RstA , Fur as well as sE ( Rhodius et al. , 2006 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18710431" target="_blank">18710431</a>]<br></li>
<li>Contrary to suf , the isc operon is not regulated by Fur but by IscR , a transcriptional-repressor encoded as part of the iscRSUA polycistron ( Schwartz et al , 2001 ; Giel et al , 2006 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19407815" target="_blank">19407815</a>]<br></li>
<li>Lee et al. previously demonstrated that suf transcription is repressed by Fur primarily by antagonizing IscR binding to PsufA ( 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur and IscR are the other global regulators that are perturbed by H2O2 stress ( Varghese et al. , 2007 ; Yeo et al. , 2006 ; Lee et al. , 2008 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21338418" target="_blank">21338418</a>]<br></li>
<li>The biosynthesis of the aerobic manganese-con-taining superoxide dismutase , which involves control by the Fur repressor ( Niederhoffer et al. 1990 ) , responds to positive redox potentials in the medium , as well ( Schiavone & Hassan 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1854188" target="_blank">1854188</a>]<br></li>
<li>The cyoA operon and the narG operon , found to be positively regulated in the study by McHugh et al. ( 31 ) , also showed strong positive regulation by Fur in our experiments but no effect of RyhB ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query / acc.cgi?acc GSE3105 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>The sufABCDSE operon is directly regulated by OxyR , IHF , Fur and an unidentiﬁed oxidant-responsive ( ORE ) activator ( Lee and Roe , 1997 ; Lee et al. , 2003 ; 2004 ; Outten et al. , 2004 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16824106" target="_blank">16824106</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Fur protein is not only auto-regulated and re-gulated by the cAMP-CAP catabolite repression system ( De Lorenzo et al. , 1988 ) , but also by OxyR and SoxRS ( Zheng et al. , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11931550" target="_blank">11931550</a>]<br></li>
<li>The induction of Fur by SoxRS should decrease the generation of HO radicals ( Zheng et al. , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11931550" target="_blank">11931550</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because Fe-Fur may be damaged during oxidative-stress , the residual transcriptional activation of suf seen in the mutant strains ( Fig. 3B ) could be the result of loss of Fur repression of suf upon H2O2 exposure .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15101990" target="_blank">15101990</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because IscR levels and Fe-S cluster occupancy vary depending on the genetic backgrounds used in the previous experiment , we constructed strains where iscR was ectopically expressed to systematically examine the effect of IscR levels on Fur repression of suf .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>We extended this analysis to compare the effects of IscR cluster occupancy on Fur repression of suf by comparing wild-type IscR to IscR-C92A , the variant lacking a Fe-S cluster , as a mimic for the apoprotein form of IscR that is generated in strains lacking the Isc pathway .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>We observed that under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions , Fur repressed expression of PsufA ( bp 393 to 90 ) - lacZ and PsufA ( bp 200 to 40 ) - lacZ as expected , since - galactosidase activity was 6 - to 17-fold lower in the wild-type strain than in a fur mutant ( Fig. 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the case where Fur binding to PsufA was disrupted , providing a measure of only IscR activation , anaerobic - galactosidase activity was slightly increased ( 2-fold ) in the strain expressing IscR-C92A compared to that expressing wild-type IscR ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of Fur , the increase in suf expression could be attributed to both an increase in basal promoter activity and IscR-dependent activation ( Fig. 2 ; compare wild-type , iscR , fur , and fur iscR strains ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , to compare the abilities of holo-IscR and apo-IscR to activate suf , wild-type IscR or IscR-C92A was produced from Ptac and PsufA-lacZ and PsufA ( Fur * ) - lacZ expression was measured .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , suf expression in the wild-type strain reﬂects contributions from both IscR activation and Fur repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , these data show that in the absence of the Isc pathway , suf expression is higher than wild-type levels , which can be explained by both increased IscR activation and diminished Fur repression , providing sufﬁcient suf expression to support viability .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under nonstress conditions , Fur antagonizes IscR binding to PsufA , thus keeping suf expression low under conditions when the Isc system is functional ( 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , under Fe-limiting conditions , loss of the Fur Fe2 cofactor eliminates Fur binding , allowing apo-IscR to fully activate suf expression ( 11 , 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , a mutant lacking Fur and the Isc pathway increased suf expression to the highest observed levels and nearly restored [ 2Fe-2S ] - IscR activity , providing a mechanism for regulating IscR activity under stress conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , in strains lacking the Isc pathway , Fur repressed suf expression only 4-fold , presumably because increased IscR levels are able to compete with Fur for its binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Despite the role of Fur in repressing suf in the absence of IscR , no colonies or only suppressor mutants were recovered when iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx or iscRSUA alleles were introduced into a fur strain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since our data show that IscR-dependent suf activation is increased in the absence of Fur ( Fig. 2 ) , we tested whether this induction resulted in increased [ 2Fe-2S ] - IscR activity in a strain also lacking the Isc pathway .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , Fur derepression was not sufﬁcient for viability in the absence of IscR and the Isc pathway , highlighting the importance of direct IscR activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur derepression is not sufﬁcient for viability when the Isc pathway and IscR-dependent activation of suf are eliminated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Further studies with acn-lac2 gene fusions and a wider range of transcription regulators indicated that acnA expression is initiated by G ~ ~ from PIacnAa , nd from PZacnA it is activated directly or indirectly by CRP , FruR , Fur and SoxRS , and repressed by ArcA and FNR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>]<br></li>
<li>This showed that the acnB gene is subject to repression by ArcA , Fis and FruR and activation by CRP , whereas the a c n A gene is repressed by ArcA and FNR , activated by FruR , CRP , Fur and SoxRS , and initiated by a38in stationary phase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both genes are subject to ArcA-mediated anaerobicrepression and CRP-mediated catabolite repression , but they differ insofar as a c n A gene transcription is activated by Fur , SoxRS and FruR , can be initiated by t ~ a ~ d ~ is r , epressed by FNR , whereas the acnB gene is repressed by Fis and FruR but unaffected by the other regulators .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the wild-type and fur mutant strains showed fully positive responses , the results suggest that Fur and Crp may interact to regulate cellular carbon metabolic activities in previously unrecognized ways .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>Another gene , ompF , encoding an outer membrane porin , showed apparent repression by Crp in the wild-type genetic background and activation by Fur in the same background ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>As for the cspA and ompF genes , Crp appeared to activate transcription of the sdh and suc genes although the activation by Fur was less pronounced .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , the fumA gene , encoding fumarase , shows strong apparent activation by both Crp and Fur , but the loss of both of these transcription factors together , as for the sdh and suc operons , gave a much less than additive effect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , the loss of both Crp and Fur activated a heterogeneous group of genes under S control encoding , for example , the cyclopropane fatty acid synthase , Cfa , the glycogen synthesis protein , GlgS , the 30S ribosomal protein , S22 , and the mechanosensitive channel protein , YggB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Table 1 , genes meeting these criteria can be divided into four categories : A , genes that appear to be repressed by Fur but activated by Crp in a fur background ( i.e. , genes involved in iron sequestration and transport ) ; B , genes that appear to be activated by Fur but repressed by Crp in a fur background ( i.e. , the sodB gene and the aceBAK operon ) ; C Category A aceEd 1,880 8,177 4,520 4,447 5,107 5,046 1,787 2,144 2.7 aceF 1,712 5,255 3,134 2,758 3,920 3,321 1,271 1,596 2.3 genes that appear to be activated by Fur and activated by Crp in a fur background ( i.e. , the cspA cold-shock regulatory gene and the ompF outer membrane porin gene as well as several genes encoding Krebs cycle enzymes ) ; and D , genes that appear to be repressed by both Crp and Fur ( e.g. , the glgS gly-cogen biosynthetic gene and the rpsV ribosomal protein gene ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>There are functional interactions between the carbon and ion utilization regulators Crp and Fur , and it was shown that the TCA cycle was repressed by the loss of both transcription factors [ 25 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21272324" target="_blank">21272324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Additionally , physical interactions between Crp and/or Fur with other regulators such as IHF , Cra , and FadR could be important .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the three other possible consequences of the loss of these two transcription factors in a wild-type background indicate that gene expression can be activated and repressed , activated and activated , or repressed and repressed by Fur and Crp , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcriptional levels of fur gene expression were reported to be repressed by Fur and stimulated by Crp ( 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both Fur repression and Crp stimulation of transcription caused modest changes in fur gene expression during exponential-growth ( 2-fold ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of this gene appeared to be activated by glucose , but also by Fur , and was further activated by Crp ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the sodB gene , encoding superoxide dismutase , and the aceBAK operon , encoding the glyoxalate shunt enzymes , show the opposite responses , being activated by the loss of Crp and repressed by the loss of Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>The aceBAK operon and the sodB gene ( Table 1 ) appeared to be activated by Fur and repressed by Crp in a fur background .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>c While cueO is weakly regulated by RyhB in the fur mutant , it is not repressed by Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>Most strikingly , Crl and Fur regulated their own and each other 's transcription ( Fig. 4 , A and B ) : Crl repressed its own transcription and slightly activated the transcription of fur ; Fur positively auto-regulated itself and repressed the transcription of crl .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the failure of the multicopy fur ' plasmid to reverse the small derepression observed in the fur mutant indicated that acnB is neither activated nor repressed by Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>]<br></li>
<li>Many genes repressed by Fur are activated by GraL in ppGpp background during short-term exposure .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20008510" target="_blank">20008510</a>]<br></li>
<li>As noted above , many genes subject to simultaneous Fur and Crp regulation are apparently repressed by Fur and activated by Crp in a fur mutant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>genes are directly or indirectly repressed by the loss of Fur and activated by the loss of Crp in a fur background .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>

<li>Samples were taken at the time of induction and 20 and 40 min after induction in triplicate for Western blot analysis with anti-Hfq antibodies ( Fig. 3A ) , for the pulse labelling experiment ( de novo synthesis of Fur upon Hfq induction ; Fig. 4 ) as well as for Northern blot analysis ( determination of the steady-state levels of hfq , fur , sodB , RyhB and 5S RNAs ; Fig. 5 ) .

<li>The results clearly conﬁrm the RyhB and Fe2 + -- Fur dependence of bfr expression showing that Bfr levels are decreased either by Dip treatment or by the fur mutation , and that these effects are RyhB dependent in that they are absent in the ryhB mutants ( Fig. 3B ) .

<li>However , the Fe2 + -- Fur dependence of FtnA levels was not notably inﬂu-enced by the ryhB mutation ( Fig. 3A ) strongly indicating , contrary to the previous Northern blotting data ( Massé and Gottesman , 2002 ) , that the Fe2 + -- Fur induction of ftnA expression proceeds via a RyhB-independent pathway .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is worth noting that the decay rates of fur mRNA in the in vitro translation system were comparable in the presence and absence of RyhB ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) , which indicated that inhibition of Fur synthesis results from a RyhB-mediated block of uof translation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>RyhB downregulates the translation of uof and thereby Fur synthesis Hfq led to a comparable increase in translation of the uof-lacZ gene as observed in the absence of RyhB ( Figure 4A ) , suggesting that RyhB-mediated regulation of uof depends on Hfq .

<li>In addition , because Fur directly represses transcription of RyhB ( 32 ) , Fur indirectly affects the stability of the iscSUA-hscBA-fdx transcript , thus promoting Fe-S cluster biogenesis via the Suf pathway when Fe is limiting .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>One possible explanation for this observation was that the absence of RyhB results in higher levels of ironcontaining proteins ( Massé et al , 2005 ) , which would decrease the cellular Fe pool , leading to a reduced Fur 2 þ activity , which in turn could result in derepression of fur transcription .

<li>To date , the structures of several Fur family members , including the zinc response-regulator , Zur , are known in the absence of DNA and the nature of the core DNA element recognized by these proteins remains unclear .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25369000" target="_blank">25369000</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whereas the effect on Fur and FNR caused transcription alterations in the genes under their control , that of SoxR was unexpected ; although a large increase upon the transcription of soxS occurred , a corresponding increase on the SoxRS regulon could not be detected .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15546870" target="_blank">15546870</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is recognized that NO at low concentrations has a protective role for bacteria , as it activates transcription factors , such as SoxRS , OxyR , and Fur , whose regulons encode antioxidant enzymes ( 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22563051" target="_blank">22563051</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , and contrary to SoxRS , Fur and FNR seem to be NO-sensitive regulators resulting in a finely tuned control of their regulons , i.e. they act as multi-responsive regulators .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15546870" target="_blank">15546870</a>]<br></li>
<li>The combination of Δfur and ΔnrdR alleles resulted in a synergistic effect on transcription , indicating that Fur and NrdR repress nrdHIEF independently of one another .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21338418" target="_blank">21338418</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus these three regulatory proteins act independently of one another : NrdR : dATP and Fur : Fe2 + repress nrdHIEF transcription , while apo-IscR activates it .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21338418" target="_blank">21338418</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Table 8 , the promoters of fecI ( A1174T , A1210G ) and fecI ( A1180G ) bound less Fe21 Fur than the fecI ( A1120G ) and wild-type fecI promoters , resulting in an increased concentration of free Fe21 Fur , which could then bind to the fhuF promoter and repress fhuF-lacZ transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11114913" target="_blank">11114913</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fecI promoter mutations that partially restored induction of fecB gene transcription of the inactive fecR mutants bound less Fe21 Fur and consequently led to a higher fecI and fecR transcription than in the wild-type fecIR strain under the same conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11114913" target="_blank">11114913</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the acceleration of trypsin-catalyzed TAME esterolysis is independent of MnC12concentration in the range tested ( see Table I ) , while the degree of acceleration of Fur ' hydrolysis is strongly dependent on metal ion concentration , as is shown in Figure 2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results of a quantitative analysis of the effect of DNA on the rate of Fur trypsinolysis in the absence of metal ( performed in the same manner as the experiments showing the quantitative effect of MnCI2on the rate of Fur trypsino-lysis ) are shown in Table I. DNA lowers the activity of trypsin as determined by the effect on TAME trypsinolysis , but the effect is both of lower magnitude and of different concentration dependence than is observed with Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>As was observed with trypsin , DNA inhibits Fur proteolysis but has a negligible effect on the activity of chymotrypsin ( as measured with CTNE ) , as shown in Table I .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Multicopy fur also increased FtnA levels in the presence of Dip by 10-fold ( Fig. 1B , lanes 5 -- 6 cf. 7 -- 8 ) indicating that ampliﬁcation of Fur levels can partially compensate for the inhibition of FtnA production by Dip .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggested that sodA repression is partially mediated by Fnr and that increased levels of Fnr ( due to the presence of a multicopy plasmid bearing the fnr + gene ) can partially ( -50 % ) substitute for the absence of Fur , ArcA , or both .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>Increasing concentrations of the Fur protein ( 50 -- 450 nM ) in the presence and absence of 0.15 mM MnCl2 were incubated in a solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) , 0.1 mM EDTA , 5 mM dithiothreitol , and 10 % glycerol for 20 min at room temperature .

<li>Fur acts as a classical repressor , blocking transcription in the presence of Fe ( I1 ) or other divalent first row transition elements , although ferrous ion is probably the main metal available to the repressor in the cell ( Bagg & Neilands , 1987a ) .

<li>When Fur was included in the reactions at a concentration of 40 nM , no change in the pattern of cleavage products was observed either in the presence of 2,2 ' - dipyridyl , a synthetic metal chelator , or in the absence of an added metal ion ( Fig. 3 , lanes 2 and 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2644221" target="_blank">2644221</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is apparent that the protective effect of Fur in the presence of 100 jxM Mn2 + was dependent on the concentration of the protein ( Fig. 3 , lanes 7 to 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2644221" target="_blank">2644221</a>]<br></li>

<li>This strengthens the notion that only the presence or absence of divalent cations and not the changes in RNAP versus Fur concentrations is translated into transcriptional repression or derepression of the system .

<li>In the presence of saturating concentrationsof CdSO , , relatively high concentrations of Fur ( about 200 nM ) are required to fully bind thefur operator DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>

<li>Because previous work in our laboratory indicated that Fur activity is not titrated out in the presence of operators carried on multicopy plasmids ( 8 , 34 ) , a pBR322-based construct was employed .

<li>This mechanism seems unlikely since Nakamura has shown that Fur exists as a dimer both in the presence and absence of metal , down to concentrations of 1 pM ( Neilands & Nakamura , in press ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>

<li>As can be seen in Figure 1 , densitometric analysis of the gel reveals that Fur ' is converted to FurT 5.8 times faster in the presence of metal than in its absence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Figure 1 , chymotrypsin cleaves Fur in the presence of saturating MnClzconsiderably faster than in its absence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>

<li>In the presence of both metals , Fur appears to be cut at the same rate that is observed in the presence of cadmium alone .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Solid lines delineate the region of primary protection , and broken lines indicate the region protected only in the presence of higher concentrations of Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8021177" target="_blank">8021177</a>]<br></li>

<li>As shown in Fig. 2A , increasing concentrations of Fur protein in the presence of Mn21 decreased the activity of fepA and fes promoters with respect to a repressorless control .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9573216" target="_blank">9573216</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both the magnitude and concentration dependence of Mn ( I1 ) acceleration of hydrolysis differ significantly for Fur and TAME , suggesting that the increased rate of Fur trypsinolysis in the presence of metal is due to a conformational change in the Fur protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>cleavageof Fur occurs in the N-terminal region of the protein , and , in the presence of activating metal , Fur undergoes a conformationalchange that makes it more sensitive to tryp-sinolysis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results indicate that in the presence of activating metals Fur undergoes a conformational change that renders the N-terminal region of the protein sensitive to proteolytic cleavage .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>

<li>The observation that the ahpC and ryhB genes , which are regulated primarily by OxyR and Fur , respectively , are induced by PMS ( Fig. 8 ) and menadione ( W.

<li>The reduction of siderophores observed in a ΔryhB mutant raises the possibility that , without RyhB , the free intracellular Fe becomes sufﬁciently elevated to activate the Fur repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20696910" target="_blank">20696910</a>]<br></li>
<li>To clarify this issue , we set up a competition assay in which we added increasing RNAP concentrations to a DNA template prebound by Fur ( Fig. 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9573216" target="_blank">9573216</a>]<br></li>

<li>The observation of two gpmA -- Fur complexes is consistent with the presence of two tandem and overlapping Fur boxes ( spanning 25 bp ) for gpmA allowing two Fur dimers to-bind ( forming the g1 complex ) at low Fur concentration and three Fur dimers to-bind ( forming the g2 complex ) at higher concentrations .

<li>This is what is expected , given that Cd ( I1 ) binds Fur much more tightly than Mn ( II ) , if both metals activate Fur protease sensitivity by binding to the same site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>

<li>The Fur-Cd ( I1 ) complex is also less sensitive to trypsinolysis than the Fur-Mn ( 11 ) complex , suggesting that the metal-induced conformational change responsible for increased protease sensitivity is the same as the metal-induced change in Fur that allows DNA binding .

<li>Furthermore , metals that activate Fur for DNA binding [ Mn ( II ) , Ni ( II ) , and Cd ( II ) ] also activate protease sensitivity , while Mg ( I1 ) fails to induce either change in the Fur protein ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Equilibrium dialysis and protease sensitivity competition experiments support the hypothesis that Cd ( I1 ) and Mn ( I1 ) bind to the same sites in the Fur protein , although it is possible that the two metals bind to Fur at different sites and induce conformational changes that prevent binding of additional metal ions .

<li>This change in the metal environment could alter the conformation of the protein and , therefore , modify the ability of Fur to-bind to DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previous research has not examined the structure-function relationships of the Fur protein or the mechanism by which metal activates the ability of the repressor to-bind with high affinity to operator DNA .

<li>The capacity of metal-substituted Fur to-bind DNA was investigated by using the method developed by Bagg and Neilands ( 29 ) , which is based on the protection by the activated Fur protein of a hinfI site located in a Fur box inserted in a plasmid .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>The simplest explanation to account for our results is that Fur behaves as a divalent metal ion binding protein that , in the metal complex form , acts as a transcriptional-repressor by binding at the aerobactin operator site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2823881" target="_blank">2823881</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results are consistent with in vitro studies of Fur demonstrating that binding of metal ion induces a conformational change in the DNA-binding domain of the Fur protein ( Coy and Neilands , 1991 ) .

<li>The acceleration of Fur proteolysis in the presence of metal is analogous to the behavior of the E. coli CRP protein : cyclic AMP binding to the N-terminal domain of CRP induces protease sensitivity in the C-terminal DNA-binding domain ( Heyduk & Lee , 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Fur protein binds to DNA as a dimer , and the binding is metal dependent ( Bagg and Neilands .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>The model for the mechanism of metal ion activation of Fur DNA binding that best explains the data outlined above postulates that metal binding to Fur induces a conformational change that allows the protein to interact with DNA .

<li>' Tyr45 is not conserved across all Fur homologs , but is unique to gram negative Zur protein-DNA recognition , and likely provides discrimination between Zur - and Fur-regulated promoters ( Table S1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25369000" target="_blank">25369000</a>]<br></li>
<li>A likely explan-ation for the discrepancy is that in gel shift experiments the non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel helps to stabilize the protein -- DNA complex , while in footprinting experiments , Fur binds DNA weakly in solution , and the Fur -- DNA complex formed is easily dissociated by DNase I .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is likely that each subfamily of Fur proteins has some unique networks , whether hydrogen bonding or specific salt bridges to stabilize their specific protein-DNA complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25369000" target="_blank">25369000</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , since Fur is a rigid protein , its ability to wrap around DNA is questionable , suggesting that Fur binds only to one side of the DNA helix .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>

<li>This analysis shows that very low concentrations of CdS04 ( X2 .5 pM ) fully activate the Fur protein , in contrast to Mn ( II ) , where 50-80 pM MnC12is required to induce maximum Fur DNA binding ( see Figure 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since high concentrations of cadmium also induce a unique conformation of Fur , as determined by protease sensitivity ( Figure 1 l ) , this suggests that binding of cadmium to the second low-affinity site in the Fur protein may cause the protein to adopt a conformation that has a low affinity for DNA , although this inhibition could also be due to protein precipitation or other effects .

<li>Since the activities calculated here are a proxy for the inferred conentration of protein in the DNA-binding form , this phase is reflected in an increase in Fur activity in Fig. 5 ( d ) over the first 10 min of the transit .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the assay , performed with highly purified Fur protein , DNA , and HinfI restriction enzyme ( which may contain unknown contaminants from Haemophilus influenzae ) , revealed Fur activity , it follows that the Fur protein probably requires only certain divalent metals , and no additional cofactors , for its site-specific DNA binding activity .

<li>Examination of , - galactosidase activity coded from a chromosomal d ( sodA ' - ` lacZ ) fusion suggests that metallated Fur protein acts as a transcriptional-repressor of sodA ( manganese superoxide dismutase [ MnSOD ] ) .

<li>In this case , competition between the RNAP and the repressor for their respective overlapping binding sites , and not any other effect , determines how efﬁciently promoter activity is controlled by the Fur protein .

<li>In the presence of another promoter , which was cloned in a high copy number vector , Fur repressor protein was titrated away from the chromosomal fhuFp-lacZ fusion , leading to increased b-galactosidase activity .

<li>It is possible that the aerobactin-specific , metal-dependent effect of our Fur-enriched extract is not due to the Fur protein itself but rather due to some other factor present in our extract that is induced by overproductionof the Fur protein , or as a result of the addition of nalidixic acid .

<li>The mechanism of this regulation is now understood in broad outline ( 2 , 3 , 9 , 14-16 , 25 , 26 , 39 , 41 , 44 , 46 , 58 , 59 ) : the product of the fur gene , Fur , is a 17-kilodalton polypeptide that binds Fe2 , forming a dimeric protein ( metallated or holo Fur ) that associates with a specific DNA sequence in the operator-promoter regions offur-controlled genes ; there Fur in conjunction with Fe acts as a repressor of transcription ( 16 , 58 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Another sequence that may bind the Fur repressor is predicted to overlap the fepB transcript initiation site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2536681" target="_blank">2536681</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , this seems to be the maximum level as inactivation of the Fur repressor did not increase it .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15853883" target="_blank">15853883</a>]<br></li>
<li>Possibly , new Fur synthesis is required to replace Fur that is damaged by oxidants reacting with metals bound by the repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10419964" target="_blank">10419964</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur is a repressor that binds to specific DNA sequences called Fur boxes , usually located in the promoter region of a target gene .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>in which Fur repressor appears to wra , p around the DNA helix such that single base changes rnxv not , affect repressor -- operator interactions to n sfiniticant degree .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2139473" target="_blank">2139473</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because of this , understanding the mechanism of DNA sequence recognition and ligand activationof Fur will provide valuable information about repressor action in general .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vitro binding of Fur to DNA has been previously studied on a few Fur-regulated genes , but its mechanism is still unclear .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>Most Fur-regulated genes are derepressed in growth at low iron and are repressed under conditions of high iron , and in vitro DNA binding assays suggest that high levels of iron favor Fur association with DNA ( 2 , 3 , 9 , 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10419964" target="_blank">10419964</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , during iron-replete growth , Fur appears to act as a repressor of transcription by blocking formation of a DNA-RNA polymerase complex , analogous to the mechanism previously described for regulation of the aerobactin operon ( V. de Lorenzo , S. Wee , M. Herrero , and J. B. Neilands , J. Bacteriol .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2644221" target="_blank">2644221</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the cellular iron level becomes too low , the active Fur repressor looses Fe2 , its corepressor , and is no longer able to-bind to specific DNA sequences .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore it is reasonable to think that the iron regulation afforded by fur on the aerobactin operon ( and on other siderophore systems ) is mostly due to the changes in the DNA-binding activity of Fur in response to intracellular Fez + concentrations rather than to changes in the levels of Fur repressor itself .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2836193" target="_blank">2836193</a>]<br></li>
<li>Possibly , Fur sequesters iron in order to reduce the levels of DNA-bound iron .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10419964" target="_blank">10419964</a>]<br></li>
<li>For the E. coli Fur repressor whose activity is regulated by cellular iron levels , NO was found to react with the bound iron to form an iron -- Fur -- NO complex and thereby abolish the DNA binding activity of this repressor ( 50 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>Based on the observed regulation by Fur , the presence of a potential nickel-binding region within the YqjI transcriptional-regulator , and the observed regulation of yqjH and yqjI by YqjI , we tested if expression of yqjH is altered by transition metal ions in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097627" target="_blank">21097627</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results are in accordance with the proposed inactivation of the DNA binding capacity of Fur caused by NO ( 8 ) and the concomitant abolishment of Fur-dependent regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15546870" target="_blank">15546870</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since no good Crp or Fur binding sites could be identiﬁed upstream or within the sodB gene , sodB regulation is likely to be indirect and prove complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>Further elucidation of the nature and position of Fur binding sites , as well as of the relationship between Fur/operator binding and aerobactin regulation , will require footprintin and , more importantly , genetic analysis of the operator region .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2823881" target="_blank">2823881</a>]<br></li>
<li>At the fur promoter region , when we added 0.76 M His6-Crl ( 3.6 M Fur in the reaction ) , a slower migrating complex appeared , and the proportion of free DNA decreased 2-fold when 0.88 M or more His6-Crl was included in the reaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>
<li>H-NS and Fur compete for the same binding region on ftnA promoter To further elucidate the mechanism of ftnA regulation by Fur and H-NS , and to determine whether these two DNA-binding proteins do indeed compete for the same site , H-NS and Fur were added in combination to footprinting reactions ( Fig. 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>To investigate this possibility and confirm Fur binding to the Crl promoter , we tested in vitro the influence of Crl on the binding of Fur to two DNA regions , crl and fur promoter regions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>
<li>Binding conditions Mg2 + ions , as magnesium sulphate solution , were added to DNA solutions to make DNA fragments bind to Fur [ 6 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2015825" target="_blank">2015825</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like Dps and Fur , YaaA has the effect of minimizing damage both to DNA and to proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21378183" target="_blank">21378183</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the aromatic region , no significant changes of the DNA resonances are observed when compared to those of the Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2015825" target="_blank">2015825</a>]<br></li>
<li>In these experiments , proteins that bind to DNA ( Fur , Fur ' ) adhere to the blue dye column , while those that do not bind DNA ( FurC , FurT ) are not retained , suggesting that it might be acting as a DNA affinity column .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , competition experiments show that Fur and ArcA binding to the sodA promoter are mutually exclusive and that ArcA can easily displace Fur , but not vice versa .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur and ArcA DNA-binding sequences were found to overlap considerably and competition experiments , in agreement with in vivo results , demonstrate that Fur and ArcA repression of sodA are mutually exclusive .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>When Fur and ArcA are both present , the protected region corresponds either to the Fur or to the ArcA footprint , but clearly never include both , excluding simultaneous binding of Fur and ArcA to sodA DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>Competition between the global regulators Fur and ArcA for binding to DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19400769" target="_blank">19400769</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , competition experiments show that binding of Fur and ArcA are mutually exclusive and that ArcA binds to Fur-coated DNA with about the same efficiency as to naked DNA , whereas Fur does not bind readily to ArcA-coated DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>We have also looked at the binding of [ Cr ( CN ) 6I3 - to Fur with a view to testing whether binding is due to electrostatic interaction between Fur and the negative surface of the DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2015825" target="_blank">2015825</a>]<br></li>
<li>We repeated the analysis , using equally stringent search criteria , for other global DNA-binding proteins ( LexA , Fur , FruR , FNR , CRP , NarL and Fis ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18515344" target="_blank">18515344</a>]<br></li>
<li>When Fe is scarce , Fur loses its DNA-binding activity , the Fur regulon is de-repressed and Fe is taken up by the cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>There does seem to be some specificity in Fur ' DNA binding since it has higher affinity for operator-containing DNA than for nonspecific vector DNA , unlike FurN , which binds to both with about equal affinity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the protection by DNA of the N-terminus of Fur from protease digestion and the loss in binding affinity and specificity observed in Fur ' all indicate that the N-terminal region of is necessary for DNA binding , they do not show whether the N-terminal region of Fur is sufficient for DNA binding , since FurN does binds to DNA with low affinity and no detectable specificity .

<li>Iron starvation , through either exhaustion of extracellular iron or the presence of extracellular chelators , prevents DNA binding by Fur , apparently by diminishing the pool of iron available for it to-bind .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10368155" target="_blank">10368155</a>]<br></li>
<li>Additionally , we have examined the binding of manganese ions to Fur in the presence of the DNA fragment and go on to discuss the likely way in which the Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2015825" target="_blank">2015825</a>]<br></li>
<li>analysis of Fur DNA binding in the presence of cadmium , as measured by DNase I footprinting , is shown in Figure 11 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Figure 7 shows that Fur ' is able to-bind DNA in the gel shift assay , but the specificity and the affinity of binding is lower than that seen with native Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>DNA complex responds to metal-ion binding to Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2015825" target="_blank">2015825</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both metals probably bind to the same pocket in Fur because each can induce both DNA binding and protease sensitivity B8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the appearance of all shifted bands depends upon the presence of Fur in a binding medium containing MnCl2 , so for the purposes of comparing the relative affinities of the repressor for each of the three operator variants , all shifted fragments were considered to be bound by Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8021177" target="_blank">8021177</a>]<br></li>
<li>DNase I footprint analysis revealed binding of Fur to the fecABCDE and fecIR promoters that depended on the presence of the co-repressor Mn2 + , which had been used instead of Fe2 + .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9575233" target="_blank">9575233</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of Fe2 , mntH is repressed primarily by Fur , acting through a Fur-binding motif overlapping the 35 region .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of Fe2 + -- Fur , H-NS sites II -- VI are occupied by multiple Fe2 + -- Fur dimers which prevents cooperative binding of H-NS at other sites ( I , V and VI ) , thus relieving the H-NS-dependent repression of ftnA transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also , Fur was only able to displace H-NS in the presence of MnCl2 ( not shown ) , which supports results obtained using in vitro transcription ( provision of Fur without Mn2 + produced no Fur footprints such that only the H-NS binding sites were visible ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>There is the formal possibility that repression involves some other protein which is expressed only in the presence of Fur ; however the same uncertainties as to the cis-acting binding motif apply to it as well .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Data are derived from Figs 8A , 9A and 10A ( sense strand only ) and show the footprints obtained : ( i ) in the absence of any binding protein , ( ii ) in the presence of H-NS , ( iii ) in the presence of Mn2 + -- Fur , and ( iv ) in the presence of both H-NS and Mn2 + -- Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>Most likely , binding at Fur box II would encourage subsequent cooperative binding of Fur at the adjacent sites which would further depend upon relatively high Fe2 + -- Fur levels .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is clear that increased negative supercoiling resulting from an aerobic to anaerobic shift does not enhance Fur binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>In summary , if anaerobic repression of tonS were due to increased negative supercoiling , we would expect the repression to be manifested by either decreased activity of the promoter or increased binding of Fur protein to the operator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our results ruie out both supercoilingmediated decreased promoter function and increased Fur binding as mediators of anaerobic repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>The anaerobic repression is not due to decreased promoter function owing to changes in supercoiling or increased Fur binding at the operator , but rather appears to involve an upstream sequence and an additional , uncharacterized factor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Given that a single dimer of Zur can bind to the pliG operator and the precedence for single dimer Fur repression [ 64 ] , it is possible that future studies will identify additional Zur operators , including those that contain only a single dimer binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25369000" target="_blank">25369000</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since there is a predicted Fur binding site in the mntP promoter , one possibility is that , akin to the partial repression of mntH by Mn-loaded Fur , Mn-Fur partially activates mntP transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21908668" target="_blank">21908668</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since anaerobic repression is Fur dependent , we wanted to determine where Fur binds and whether the extent of Fur binding could account for anaerobic repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>This was surprising because the iron-dependent repressor Fur , whose higher-afﬁnity binding at the sufA promoter should occlude IscR binding , showed only partial repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the contrary , in vitro , Fur is not dependent on iron for either DNA binding or transcriptional repression ( Bsat and Helmann , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18176545" target="_blank">18176545</a>]<br></li>
<li>Involvement of Fur in expression control of rcnA suggested that RcnR -- Fur interaction is required for promoter binding or for functional alteration of Fur except for overproduction of RcnR in a Dfur strain still inhibited rcnA expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17120142" target="_blank">17120142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regulators such as ArcA , Fur , and Fnr would be found in much lower concentrations in the cell ; thus it is not surprising that their binding activities are not evident in cell-free extracts .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7862094" target="_blank">7862094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Each binding reaction contained 0.1 pmol of the labelled HindIII-XhoI fragment from pITS343-0 , pITS343-13 , or pITS343-16 and varying concentrations of Fur in a volume of 20 , ul .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8021177" target="_blank">8021177</a>]<br></li>
<li>Assuming that the iron box of sodA is the binding site of holo Fur , the affinity of Mn2 ' - Fur for the sodA promoter is significantly less than for the iucA promoter ; we believe this results from the different sequence of the sodA iron box and reflects nonoptimal solution conditions for Mn2 + - Fur binding to sodA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , one would expect that rather different conditions must be found to optimize the binding of Fur to this promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>This weaker binding is also apparent in an increased diffuseness of the bands we believe to be Fur : sodB complexes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Scanning for Fur binding sites Fur in high concentration can bind weak sites , while in low concentration it binds only strong sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>
<li>It was predicted that the AT changes would increase Fur binding at all three sequences ; however , only 43-7 was affected by this change .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , as demonstrated by footprint data , Fur binding can extend to ﬂanking regions that bear little resemblance to the strong Fur binding sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>

<li>Because these footprints were performed in vivo , they should accurately reflect the biologically relevant degree of Fur binding to its operator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>

<li>Fur binding to this site was unaffected by Crl .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , gel shift studies demonstrated that the Fur -- promoter complexes exhibit a unique hierarchy of binding , with distinct species forming at increasing concentrations of Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>
<li>We reasoned that if Fur can inhibit binding of polymerase to the aerobactin promoter , it might also inhibit binding of the restriction enzyme HinfI to a specific site between the -35 and -10 regions of that promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2823881" target="_blank">2823881</a>]<br></li>
<li>tively , the presence of potential promoter and Fur repressor binding sites just 59 to the putative initiation codon of exbD has led to the suggestion that exbB and exbD could be independently expressed ( 8 ) .

<li>Crl Modulates the Binding Ability of Fur on DNA by a Direct Protein-Protein Interaction -- Fur regulates transcription of target genes by binding to specific sites upstream or overlapping the promoter , whereas Crl physically interacts with RpoS ( and not with 70 ) and increases its activity ( 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>
<li>We show that NO inhibits Fur repressor activity in vivo and Fur DNA-binding activity in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vitro Fur DNA-binding activity , as measured by protection of restriction site in aerobactin promoter , is directly sensitive to NO .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>In agreement with in vivo assays , we observed that a 3-fold excess of NO was sufficient to switch off Fur binding to the aerobactin promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>which can also bind Fur , has been substituted as a co-repressor in in vitro experiments performed so far owing to the difficulties in maintaining an environment compatibie with Fe '' binding ( DeLorenzo et ai , 1987 ; 1988 ; Griggs and Konisky , 1989 ; Brickman etai , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Such a position is unusual for a functional Fur binding site as Fur typically binds within the promoter region between or on the promoter elements of the genes it regulates ( e.g. cir , aer , cva , cvi and sodA genes ; Griggs and Konisky , 1989 ; Tardat and Touati , 1993 ; Escolar et al. , 1997 ; Boyer and Tai , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that Fur may mainly act as a direct repressor of genes by binding to and blocking the promoters , and that direct activation by Fur through binding to the region upstream of a promoter , as suggested in Neisseria meningitidis by Delany et al. ( 59 ) , may not be a common mechanism of Fur regulation in E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been suggested that in N. meningitidis Fur can also directly activate genes by binding to the region upstream of the promoters ( 59 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regulatory binding sites for MetR , PurR , and Fur boxes are in - Galactosidase activity of ( hmpEc - ` lacZ ) and ( hmpSt - ` lacZ ) transcriptional fusions in E. coli The DNA sequence analysis of the regulatory regions of both hmp genes led us to think that , notwithstanding the lack of evidence from the transcriptional fusion of hmpSt , ( Crawford and Goldberg 1998a , 2006 ) , both this and the E. coli gene might be regulated by the NO-sen-sitivity of Fur ( D'Autreaux et al. 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17024490" target="_blank">17024490</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is likely that each extension to the Fur box would allow a further Fur dimer to-bind , thus six Fur dimers would be anticipated to-bind at the ftnA Fur binding site observed here ( Escolar et al. , 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur binds as a dimer to DNA , and iron binding to Fur appears to trigger conformational changes , which are required for a tight interaction with the ` Fur-boxes ' on DNA ( Gonzalez de Peredo et al , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>The internal symmetries in the Fur box consensus facilitate the formation of overlapping arrays , and observations on Fur binding to DNA are consistent with cooperative binding of multiple repressors on overlapping binding sites ( de Lorenzo et al. , 1988 ; Le Cam et al. , 1994 ; Escolar et al. , 1998 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10411720" target="_blank">10411720</a>]<br></li>
<li>It will be of interest to determine whether in these conditions of presumably low concentrations of active Fur only the first binding site , which does not encompass the - 1 0 position , is occupied .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results also rule out models invoking increased binding owing to greater concentrations of active Fur repressor , such as the possibility that anaerobic conditions increase the F8 '' / Fe '' ' ratio .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also ruled out is the idea that anaerobic repression resuited from an increase in active Fur levels ( with correspondingly tighter binding ) owing to increased Fe '' levels under anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , under our NMR experimental conditions , Fur dimer , prepared in the absence of DTT and without strictly respecting anaerobic conditions , slowly and irreversibly formed some monomeric species .

<li>Increased repression of tonB under anaerobic conditions is not due to changes in DNA supercoiling or increased levels of Fur , ArcA , or Fnr It has been suggested that repression of tonB under anaerobic conditions is due to increased negative supercoiling ( Dorman et ai , 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>To determine if anaerobic repression of tonB under anaerobic conditions might be due to increased levels of Fur in the cell , strain KP1027 carrying fur on a multicopy plasmid ( pMH15 ) was assayed under aerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like repression of tonB under aerobic conditions ( Postle , 1990a ) , Fur was necessary for the increased repression of tonB expression under anaerobic conditions , but , as will be discussed later , it was by itself not sufficient .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur activation is equally efﬁcient under aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ﬁndings that Dfur mutants are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and show increased oxidative DNA damage and mutations under aerobic conditions have implicated Fur in the defenses against oxidative-stress ( 32 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10419964" target="_blank">10419964</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that the aerobic repression ratios remained the same whether or not Fur was overexpressed suggested that increased levels of Fur were probably not the mechanism of anaerobic repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>The present findings ( Fig. 3 and Table 3 ) show that Fur acts as a negative regulator ( i.e. , repressor ) of sodA under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>The degree of Fur protection of guanosine residues at - 1 3 and - 2 0 on the non-coding strand was essentially identical under aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>The binding is , if anything , weaker under anaerobic conditions , indicating that anaerobic repression is not mediated through Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that the degree of Fur binding under anaerobic conditions was equal to or less than that seen under aerobic conditions rules out the possibility that supercoiling causes tighter Fur binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that mutations which inactivate one promoter have such strikingly different effects on the intact opposing promoter under conditions when Fur should be active suggests that there is a fundamental difference in the way that the fepA and fes promoters respond to Fur repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8021177" target="_blank">8021177</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that only a subset of guanosine residues are differentially protected in the presence and absence of O2 suggests that while tighter binding is not the cause of increased anaerobic repression , Fur may undergo a conformational change , Upstream of the Fur-binding site , protection of residues at positions - 8 5 and - 8 6 compared to the in vitro control reaction , which indicates all possible DMS reactive residues , was observed under all conditions ( except Anaerobic repression of tonB transcription 947 anaerobicaiiy when iron was present in excess ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , under anaerobic conditions , addition of Fur without any additional iron results in some repression of the aerobactin , but not lac , promoter ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2823881" target="_blank">2823881</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur binds tonB DNA at a site between the - 10 and ~ 35 regions of the promoter under aerobic and anaerobic conditions Discussion The phenomenon of anaerobic repression has been previously observed in the iron-regulated genes cir , fhuA , exbB and tonB ( Hantke , 1981 ; Braun , 1985 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>The pattern of guanosine residues protected from methylation indicated that Fur bound between the - 1 0 and - 3 5 regions of the tonB promoter under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions , but only when iron was present in excess ( Fig. 6 , A and B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>in vivo DMS protection footprinting indicated that Fur protein bound a single site between the - 1 0 and - 3 5 region of the tonB promoter under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions when iron is present in excess .

<li>It has recently been shown that , under anaerobic-growth conditions , Fpg activity increases in strains deﬁcient in the global regulators Fur , FNR , and ArcA ( 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10400579" target="_blank">10400579</a>]<br></li>
<li>10 1 0 0 .1 - a I .01 ' 1200 RESULTS Qualitative indications of MnSOD and FeSOD levels in CD 800 cell extracts of isogenic strains BN402 ( Fur ' ) and BN4020 ( Fur - ) grown to stationary phase under anaerobic , aerobic , and aerobic plus pQ2 + conditions are shown in Fig. 1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because MnSOD activity was greatly enhanced by pQ2 + in Fur - cells and because MnSOD was not present at significant levels in Fur - cells grown under anaerobic conditions ( Fig. 1 ) , it is likely that the fur locus is not the major controlling factor of the cell of sodA expression ; by contrast , fur must be regulating sodB expression in a very robust manner .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the experiment shown in Fig. 4 , conditions of increased Hfq concentration in the cell were mimicked , and Fur synthesis was shown to be inversely correlated with Hfq synthesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14617150" target="_blank">14617150</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , upon addition of the chelator , Fur synthesis increased up to 8 min in the ryhB strain and then decreased to comparable levels , as observed in the ryhB þ strain ( Figure 5A ) even though the fur mRNA levels increased under these conditions ( see Figure 1A and B ) .

<li>Under Fur − conditions , plating eficiency on tetracycline medium of the cells containing the plasmids was increased by greater than 10 % - to 10 & - fold compared to Fur + conditions , which conﬁrmed the involvement of Fur in the regulation of the activity of promoters preceding the nrdHIEF , pgm , nohA and yhhX genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11101675" target="_blank">11101675</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , since high levels of cAMP resulted in increased synthesis of the Fur repressor , it was expected that the activity of genes such as cir would be decreased , if affected at all , under these conditions .

<li>Fur then should down-regulate ryhB ( not present in the microarray slides , since it is found inside the intergenic region between the yhhX and yhhY open reading frames ) , and those genes down-regu-lated by RyhB should then be induced .

<li>On the other hand , aconitase genes ( acnA and acnB ) are transcriptionally regulated by a variety of global regulatory genes , where acnB expression is activated by Crp and repressed by ArcA , Fis , and Cra , while acnA expression is initiated by r38 , activated by Crp , Fur , SoxR/S , Cra and repressed by ArcA and Fnr ( Cunningham et al. 1997 ) .

<li>Accordingly , 101 genes 2 were found to be regulated by the Fe - Fur complex of which 53 were repressed and 48 induced .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>A microarray analysis by McHugh et al. found 101 genes to be regulated by Fur , 53 of which were repressed and 48 activated ( 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>
<li>A wide variety of genes involved in various mechanisms such as oxidative and acid stresses are under Fur control .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>Other genes involved in general metabolism , pathogenicity , and defense against oxidative and acid stresses are also regulated by Fur ( 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , Fur may be overexpressed in E. coli upon the induction of foreign genes through pleiotropism and in response to acid-shock stress .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16814929" target="_blank">16814929</a>]<br></li>
<li>Namely , Fur senses the reductive stress and represses genes in which Fe-S clusters are safe from damage by reactive oxygen species .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21272324" target="_blank">21272324</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is possible that under oxidative-stress the Fe21 associated with Fur is oxidized to Fe31 , which leads to the derepression of Furrepressed genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , genes encoding several transcriptional factors , such as Fur , RcsA , SoxS , and ZraR , are up-regu-lated , and others , such as GadE , GadX , GcvA , and MetR , are down-regu-lated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16418169" target="_blank">16418169</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , SoxS primarily functions as an activator whereas Fur mainly acts to repress genes under its control ( Supplementary Table S2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression levels of all of the genes listed in Table 1 are signiﬁcantly altered in response to the lack of Fur and Crp .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , when Fe is plentiful , regulatory sites in Fur will be occupied , and Fur binds to DNA and functions as a repressor of genes involved in Fe uptake .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fe-complexed Fur binds to the promoters of a number of genes involved in Fe uptake to repress transcription initiation ( 20 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20696910" target="_blank">20696910</a>]<br></li>
<li>Supporting this hypothesis , the transcript level of the Fur : Fe - repressed genes entB and fhuF increased 2 + and catalase activity decreased after 1.5 h wrwycr treatment .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22096151" target="_blank">22096151</a>]<br></li>
<li>There may be only weak repression of these genes by Fur , as none of them were signiﬁcantly repressed by Fur according to microarray analyses ( 13,60 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , at low Fe concentrations , Fur becomes inactive , which relieves the repression of genes involved in the biosynthesis , export , and import of siderophores .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20696910" target="_blank">20696910</a>]<br></li>
<li>2 Other Fe - Fur-regulated Genes -- Forty-six genes , from var-2 ious other functional categories , were also Fe - Fur controlled ( Table IV ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>This low Fe availability leads one to expect that , in the ΔryhB mutant , the Fur repressor must be inactive and Fur-regulated genes are fully derepressed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20696910" target="_blank">20696910</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , even if intracellular Fe is low enough to inactivate Fur repression , we nevertheless observe signiﬁcant repression of many Fur-regulated genes in ΔryhB cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20696910" target="_blank">20696910</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , changes in oxygen availability ( sensed directly by FNR , and indirectly by ArcA ) affect the redox state of the system , leading to consequences for metal ion homeostasis ( copper , molybdate , iron ; sensed by CusR , ModE and Fur ) , iron -- sulphur cluster turnover ( sensed by IscR ) , ribonucleotide reductase activity 20 0 31 0 10 aerobiosis ( % ) time ( min ) Figure 1 .

<li>However , such a mechanism could explain the Fe2 + -- Fur induction effects observed in other cases since while the contribution of Fur to iron induction is often clear , the involvement of an additional repressor may not be appar-2 + ent : unless direct Fe -- Fur activation can be demonstrated in vitro , then the potential for the involvement of additional factors can not be excluded .

<li>The suf system in E. chrysanthemi is also regulated by Fur in response to iron availability ( Nachin et al. , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15101990" target="_blank">15101990</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur-independent induction of sufA by oxidants As the suf operon is negatively regulated by Fur in response to iron availability ( Patzer and Hantke , 1999 ; Lee et al. , 2003 ) , and as the Fur regulon overlaps with oxidative-stress regulons ( G. Storz , personal communication ) , we examined whether the oxidant induction of sufA is mediated through Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15009899" target="_blank">15009899</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been demonstrated previously that Fur regulates this operon in response to iron ( Patzer and Hantke , 1999 ; Lee et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15009899" target="_blank">15009899</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ﬁnding that Fur , originally deﬁned as an iron-response-regulator , is a third control system involved in protection against oxidative damage ( Niederhoffer et al. , 1990 ; Foster & Hall , 1992 ; Tardat & Touati , 1991 ; Stojiljkovic et al. , 1994 ) further highlights the link between oxidative-stress and yodA expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12480884" target="_blank">12480884</a>]<br></li>
<li>A third system , Fur , controls sodA ( Niederhoffer et al. 1990 ; Tardat and Touati 1991 ; Beaumont and Hassan 1992 ) in response to iron concentration ( Bagg and Neilands 1987 ; Hantke 1981 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7862094" target="_blank">7862094</a>]<br></li>
<li>While Fur regulates the amount of incoming iron , RyhB aids degradation of certain transcripts to direct available iron away from non-essential uses ( such as iron storage or incorporation into non-essential proteins ) in low-iron conditions , thus ensuring that the limited amount of iron is put to the most beneficial use ( Massé et al. , 2005 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22096151" target="_blank">22096151</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that production of FtnA is dependent on the presence of both iron and Fur , and thus match previous reports ( Abdul-Tehrani et al. , 1999 ; McHugh et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since Fur is a transcriptional-repressor utilizing ferrous iron as co-repressor ( de Lorenzo et al. , 1987 ; Escolar et al. , 1997 ; 1998 ) , it appears likely that the Fe2 + -- Fur complex transcriptionally activates ftnA by acting either directly or indirectly .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of Fe2 + , metallo-Fur acts as a transcriptional-repressor of genes involved in iron uptake ( Escolar et al. , 1999 ; Hantke , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14617150" target="_blank">14617150</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of iron ( þ Fe ) , metallo-Fur functions as a weak repressor of its own mRNA ( De Lorenzo et al , 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>In fact , when iron levels are low , the manganese transporter gene , mntH , is upregulated through derepression of the Fur regulon ( Patzer & Hantke , 2001 ; Kehres et al. , 2002 ) , potentially facilitating this adjustment .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21338418" target="_blank">21338418</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur mainly acts by repressing gene expression under iron-sufficient conditions ; this repression is typically achieved by promoter occlusion ( de Lorenzo et al. , 2004 ; Lee and Helmann , 2007 ; Carpenter et al. , 2009 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>This can be accomplished by the iron-free ( apo ) form of Fur ( as opposed to the ferrous form ) when it directly binds to promoter regions ( e.g. pfr of H. pylori ) causing repression under iron deﬁciency and enabling derepression under iron sufficiency ( Delany et al. , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur is induced in order to restore repression of iron-import proteins ( Varghese et al. , 2007 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21143317" target="_blank">21143317</a>]<br></li>
<li>ftnA -- lacZ expression is dependent on the growth-phase , iron and Fur The cAMP-receptor protein ( CRP ) does not control ftnA or fur expression It was previously reported that the fur gene is induced approximately fourfold during post-exponential-growth in rich medium in a manner that is largely dependent on the cAMP -- CRP ( cAMP-receptor protein ) complex ( de Lorenzo et al. , 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is also interesting because Fur normally acts as an iron-responsive transcriptional-repressor ( Bagg & Nielands , 1987 ) , although it has been reported to activate the iron-containing superoxide dismutase gene , sodB ( Niederhoffer e t al. , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>This observation , along with the results shown above , suggested that in the presence of a divalent ion the RNAP is fully and quickly replaced by Fur , thereby providing a rationale for the quick responses to iron concentration in vivo ( 3 , 9 ) .

<li>We have now found that Fur represses the synthesis of the sRNA ryhB , and RyhB in turn negatively regulates synthesis of at least six proteins that bind iron in the cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown by Massé and Gottesman ( 2002 ) , Fur negatively controls transcription of the sRNA RyhB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14617150" target="_blank">14617150</a>]<br></li>

<li>As fur mRNA levels continued to increase under these conditions ( Figure 1A ) , the decrease in the de novo synthesis of Fur can most likely be attributed to iron-responsive decoding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>These experiments suggested that RyhB somehow counterbalances the increasing fur transcript levels , which under conditions of iron-depletion , results from a lack of metallo-Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>

<li>The global iron regulator Fur is induced by OxyR in response to H2O2 ( Zheng et al. , 1999 ) , which may lead to the repression of iron uptake genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15101990" target="_blank">15101990</a>]<br></li>

<li>The Fur repressor directly represses transcription of iron uptake genes and upregulates iron enzymes and storage proteins when Fe levels are abundant ( McHugh et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16956381" target="_blank">16956381</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our transcription/translation extract is heavily contaminated with iron ( around 200 pM ) , and it is difficult to determine what percentage of this iron is available to the Fur protein ( rather than being covalently bound up in heme or ironsulfide proteins , or present as insoluble ferric hydroxide , or coordinated ( controI ) pMON2064 extracts extracts added addedwlthoul Wlth30pMFe ( ll ) Fe ( ll ) FIGURE 3 : In the absence of oxygen , ur utilizes Fe ( I1 ) to regula e an aerobactin : : ZucZ fusion in vitro .

<li>This is accomplished by induction of the Dps ferritin-like protein , which sequesters unincorporated iron , and by induction of the Fur repressor , which diminishes synthesis of iron importers ( Park et al. , 2005 , Varghese et al. , 2007 ) .

<li>To date the debilitating effects of micromolar H2O2 stress have all been tracked to Fentontype reactions , including the oxidation of DNA ( Park et al. , 2005 ) , the destruction of dehydratase iron-sulfur clusters ( Jang & Imlay , 2007 ) , and the de-regulation of iron homeostasis through the inactivation of Fur protein ( Varghese et al. , 2007 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19400769" target="_blank">19400769</a>]<br></li>
<li>This includes DNA damage ( Park et al. , 2005 ) , which is driven by a Fenton reaction between H2O2 and DNA-bound iron ; dehydratase inactivation ( Flint et al. , 1993 , Jang & Imlay , 2007 ) ; disruption of Fur protein , in which H2O2 apparently oxidizes the ferrous iron cofactor ( Varghese et al. , 2007 ) ; and protein carbonylation , which also arises through Fenton chemistry ( Anjem et al. , 2009 ) .

<li>Fur protein regulates free iron metab-olism in aerobically growing E. coli ; due to the free iron overload , fur mutants are likely to experience increased levels of oxidative damage to DNA ( Touati et al. , 1995 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791149" target="_blank">12791149</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur indirectly increases iron-containing protein levels by repressing the small-RNA ryhB , which destabilizes the mRNAs of iron utilizing proteins ( Masse and Gottesman , 2002 ; Masse et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16956381" target="_blank">16956381</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the enzyme contains zinc in it 's active center ( Porter et al. , 2004 ) , and Fur protein also requires zinc ion for structural integrity ( Jacquamet et al. , 1998 ) and Fe2 + in regulation of iron assimilating genes , various concentration of zinc chloride was supplemented in the growth medium ( Table 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18176545" target="_blank">18176545</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , it has been independently demonstrated ( D'Autreaux et al. 2002 ) that the Fur protein is directly inhibited by nitrosylation of the iron and so , in principle , Fur might act as a transcriptional-regulator of hmp genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17024490" target="_blank">17024490</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to induction by ferric citrate , the fec transport genes are repressed by the iron-loaded Fur protein if sufficient amounts of iron are present in the cell ( Van hove et al. 1990 ; Enz et al. 1995 ; Ochs et al. 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9575233" target="_blank">9575233</a>]<br></li>
<li>As noted above , fusion experiments suggested that the ryhB promoter should be efficiently repressed by Fur protein in the presence of iron ( 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>During normal growth , in the presence of sufﬁcient iron , transcription of the suf operon is directly repressed by the Fur ( ferric uptake regulator ) protein attached to the suf promoter ( Outten et al , 2004 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19407815" target="_blank">19407815</a>]<br></li>
<li>When iron is abundant , Fe2 + - metallated Fur protein binds the promoter region of mntH and represses its transcription ( Kehres et al. , 2000b , Patzer & Hantke , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19400769" target="_blank">19400769</a>]<br></li>
<li>We estimate the `` loosely bound '' , cold acid-soluble ( Brumby et al. , 1967 ) iron content of our transcription/translation mix to be approximately 25 pM , though not all of even this iron may be available to the Fur protein .

<li>A protein band of the predicted size for the Fur ' - ' LacZ protein ( 118 kDa ) was apparent in the catabolite-activation-proficient strain E. coli JK935 and in the Acya mutant E. coli JK936 in the presence of cAMP or cAMP plus the iron chelator 2,2 ' - bipyridyl , while the same band is barely detectable in Acrp and Acya mutants ( E. coli JK937 and E. coli JK936 ) without additions .

<li>In the presence of Fe or 21 Mn and as soon as elongation occurs , the same region may be occupied by a multimer of the Fur protein which nucleates to the sides of the protein bound to the iron box sequence overlapping the promoters ( the stoichiometry of the binding remains uncertain ) .

<li>Dps is a ferritin-like protein that sequesters unincorporated iron and thereby reduces its role in damaging DNA ( 14 , 19 , 40 , 54 ) ; the Fur repressor is also induced ( 56 ) , and it diminishes iron import with the same end effect ( 49 ) .

<li>According to this model , when the internal concentration of iron is high , the Fur protein will complex iron and so become activated to-bind to the putative aerobactin operator , thereby inhibiting the initiation of transcription .

<li>Our data suggest that the iron-sensor protein Fur positively regulates intracellular iron use and storage indirectly , by repression of RyhB in the presence of iron .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>

<li>The use of relatively redox-inert elements such as Mn ( I1 ) greatly facilitates biochemical studies of Fur since the protein is inactivated by iron in aerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>

<li>All functions are co-ordinately regulated by iron availability , being repressed when iron supplies are replete , through the action of holorepressor composed of the protein Fur and the cofactor Fe ( ll ) ( Brickman et ai , 1990 ; Nahlik et ai , 1989 : Ozenberger et ai , 1989 : Pettis et ai , 1988 ) .

<li>A major new role for Fur in iron homeostasis has been demonstrated in which Fur mediates the control of cellular iron-protein levels in response to iron availability .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the intracellular iron concentration is high , iron binds to the Fur protein ( aporepressor ) to make active repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18176545" target="_blank">18176545</a>]<br></li>
<li>Assuming that half this iron is available to the Fur protein , we can estimate a dissociation constant of about M for the Fe ( I1 ) - Fur complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2823881" target="_blank">2823881</a>]<br></li>

<li>We suggest that NorR , and perhaps the unidentified regulators , were evolved to sense reactive nitrogen species , whereas Fur , SoxR , and OxyR were evolved to sense iron and reactive oxygen species and are collaterally activated by reactive nitrogen species .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>These include SoxR , OxyR , FNR , MetR , and Fur ( 5 , 6 , 10 , 12 , 17 ) , though in each case the principal function of the regulator is to sense another signal ( superoxide , hydrogen peroxide , oxygen , homocysteine , and iron , respectively ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16428390" target="_blank">16428390</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , nitrosylation of iron atoms , especially ironsulfur clusters , in enzymes such as aconitase and fumarase or in the transcription factors FNR , Fur , SoxR , OxyR , and NsrR inactivates their functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22029434" target="_blank">22029434</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is interesting to note that NorR , Fur , SoxR , and OxyR all appear to contain redox-active cysteines and , in some cases , iron .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>These iron-responsive regulators , RyhB and Fur also play a crucial role to reduce the response to oxidative-stress , as free iron is susceptible to react with ROS such as superoxide anions and to increase ROS production via the Fenton and Haber Weiss reactions [ 34 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23671689" target="_blank">23671689</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fusion studies further indicated that acnA andfumA are subject to a Fur - and iron-dependent activation , and that acnA and fumC are activated by the SoxRS system in response to oxidative-stress ( superoxide generation ) .

<li>Regulation of the isc operon is mediated by IscR , whereas the suf operon requires OxyR and IHF for the response to oxidative-stress and Fur for induction by iron starvation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15101990" target="_blank">15101990</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the toxicities of both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide are exacerbated by iron , Fur induction by both OxyR and SoxRS reﬂects the chemistry of oxidative-stress .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10419964" target="_blank">10419964</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur , a ferric uptake regulator that negatively regulates this operon in response to iron availability , did not mediate the oxidant induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15009899" target="_blank">15009899</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of fhuF is derepressed by a low iron level in the cell via the iron regulator Fur and repressed by OxyR , an oxidative response-regulator ( 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14756576" target="_blank">14756576</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , we propose that the pathogenic chemotaxis of V.cholerae is induced in response to the iron-restricted environments facing the bacterium within the human body , and Fur is the key regulator that mediates this response .

<li>In Enterobacteriaceae this control is mediated by Fur ( Fe uptake regulator ) and its orthologs ( 2,9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , the rate of Fe uptake was fourfold enhanced by inacti-2 + vation of the fur gene which encodes the global iron-dependent transcriptional-repressor , Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16718600" target="_blank">16718600</a>]<br></li>

<li>In the absence of Fur rcnA and rcnR were both induced by iron To investigate the complex regulation of the genes of the rcnRA-yohN region by Fe ( II ) and Fur , induction was re-examined under conditions when iron-uptake was derepressed and iron-eﬄux was diminished .

<li>Both strains grew on LB and LBD plates supplemented with hemoglobin at concentrations equal to or higher than 1024 M.

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9171402" target="_blank">9171402</a>]<br></li>
<li>This Fe-dependent repression is mediated by a transcriptional-repressor , Fur ( ferric up - take regulation ) , which also controls genes involved in other processes such as iron storage , the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle , pathogenicity , and redox-stress resistance .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggested that not only RcnR but also Fur was involved in iron-dependent negative regulation of rcnA and that the presence of both RcnR and Fur led to repression of DrcnA : : lacZ in the presence of iron .

<li>In the in vitro gel shift and DNase I footprinting assay data presented here , decreased iron regulation for both 43-7 and 43-5 was shown to result from a reduced afﬁnity for Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>
<li>In experiments involving SoxRS regulation , redox-stress was imposed by , adding methyl viologen ( 0.2 mg ml - ' , final concn ) 1h before the cultures were sampled , and in Fur studies , available iron was depleted by adding bipyridyl ( 200 pM , final concn ) at ODG5 ,0.6 , 1h before sampling .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9421904" target="_blank">9421904</a>]<br></li>
<li>To this end , we can only speculate that the complexity of the Fur regulatory circuits demands post-transcriptional regulation to adjust the concentration of this global regulator not only for iron homeostasis but also for its other tasks in cellular physiology .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14617150" target="_blank">14617150</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition the global regulator of iron homeostasis , Fur , was also required to prevent induction of rcnA by iron , exemplifying how the control circuits of metal homeostasis systems overlap to gain speciﬁcity on regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17120142" target="_blank">17120142</a>]<br></li>
<li>To determine whether iron regulation is mediated by Fur , the fur gene on the chromosome of strain SIP879 ( mntH-lacZ ) was inactivated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11466284" target="_blank">11466284</a>]<br></li>
<li>While observing that fur is not activated by treatment with NaSal , it is important to note that modulation by Fur does not account for all the observed regulation of iron uptake .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11395452" target="_blank">11395452</a>]<br></li>
<li>Together , our results indicate that YqjI is re quired for nickel-dependent regulation of yqjH , while Fur is required for iron - and cobalt-dependent regulation of yqjH .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097627" target="_blank">21097627</a>]<br></li>
<li>An ad hoc explanation for their antagonistic regulation by Fur is that an effective concentration of SOD is required in the cell , whatever the iron availability .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur is not likely to regulate mntS directly , since there was no iron regulation independent of MntR ( Fig. 3 , lane 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21908668" target="_blank">21908668</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consistent with positive regulation by Fur and iron , mRNA amounts decrease within 15 of chelator addition ( Fig. 4 , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) and in the fur mutant ( lane 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , SodB production is down-regulated when iron becomes scarce , as expression of the sodB locus is controlled negatively at the posttranscriptional level by the Fur-repressed small RNA RyhB ( 5 , 17 ) ; i.e. when Fur repression becomes inactive , RyhB is rapidly expressed , and the sRNA pairs with sodB-TIR in an antisense manner , which blocks translation ( 60 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20075074" target="_blank">20075074</a>]<br></li>
<li>This difference in basal expression is likely due to the larger amount of iron present in LB ( about 5 M ) than in minimal medium ( below 300 nM ) ( 40 ) , which leads to lower yqjH expression levels in cells grown in LB due to increased repression by Fe2 - Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097627" target="_blank">21097627</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , Fur and iron act together to repress expression of RyhB , which itself promotes degradation of mRNAs encoding iron-utilizing proteins , suggesting a role for the small RNA in prioritizing cellular iron use under iron-limiting conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the .10 - fold increase in expression seen under normally repressing ( high-iron ) conditions suggested that these mutations also resulted in a decreased ability of Fur to control this promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11222606" target="_blank">11222606</a>]<br></li>
<li>As predicted , mutations in the proposed Fur repressor-binding sequences resulted in deregulated expression of the respective fusion gene activities , implicating these sequences in the Fur-mediated repression of the divergent genes under iron-rich conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2139473" target="_blank">2139473</a>]<br></li>
<li>Not all Fur-repressed genes are present in Table 2 , in part because the level of expression was not sufﬁciently high to be detected under our growth conditions or because the degree of Fur repression is not as dramatic ; nonetheless , the iron-sparing effect can be seen for some of these genes as well .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>Most of these genes are repressed by Fur in the presence of excess iron , and therefore showed increased expression in the fur mutant under the growth conditions used .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , deletion of ryhB in the wild-type strain does not significantly increase its resistance to wrwycr , thus the altered expression of ryhB due to its reduced repression by Fur in the iron-limited conditions following wrwycr treatment is not the sole cause of the sensitivity of the wild-type strain to wrwycr .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22096151" target="_blank">22096151</a>]<br></li>
<li>We know that under these growth conditions , iron levels are low and thus , Fur repression is incomplete ; RyhB is expressed constitutively at relatively high levels .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , when iron becomes limiting , Fur repression is alleviated , RyhB synthesis is induced and expression of its targets inhibited .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23671689" target="_blank">23671689</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under low iron conditions , however , Fur releases the transcriptional repression , which allows expression of the suf operon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19407815" target="_blank">19407815</a>]<br></li>
<li>This iron-depleted media condition was employed in order to induce the expression of chromosomally encoded entero-bactin biosynthetic proteins by derepression of Fur Pull-down assays were achieved by binding H6-EntB bait protein to Co2 + - chelate resin , flowing over cell lysates , and gently washing away unbound proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19699210" target="_blank">19699210</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regardless , given the two overlapping OxyR and Fur binding sites , it is clear that fhuF expression is tightly regulated in response to both oxidative-stress and intracellular iron levels .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11443092" target="_blank">11443092</a>]<br></li>
<li>We hypothesize that the Fur protein , onc activated by an increase in the level of free intracellular iron , inhibits the expression of iron-regulated genes by binding to their operator regions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2823881" target="_blank">2823881</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similarly , production of the Fur-regulated RyhB sRNA represses the synthesis of iron-binding proteins , thereby increasing the cellular level of free iron , which will in turn repress the expression of the Fur regulon , which includes RyhB itself ( 50 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18953042" target="_blank">18953042</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although this gene is known to be Fe2 - Fur induced , its expression is RpoS dependent and so is restricted to the stationary phase .2 Thus , the array data are generally consistent with numerous previous expression studies on the Fur-regulated components of iron metabolism .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur recently was found to regulate hmp in Salmonella typhimurium , and in Escherichia coli , the iron-chelating agent 2,2 - dipyridyl induces hmp expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests strongly that the mechanism of induction by NO of hmp expression in S. typhimurium is done by inactivation of Fur , via nitrosylation of the iron of the Fur protein , as demonstrated in this paper for Fur of E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previous studies in E. coli also have shown that rcnA may be regulated by Fur in response to iron and that the RcnR protein ( that represses rcnA expression ) is itself induced by iron via a Fur-independent pathway ( 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097627" target="_blank">21097627</a>]<br></li>
<li>While Fur protein requires iron for the action to the most of the regulating gene , in some instances Fur may not require iron for the control of gene expression ( Foster and Hall , 1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18176545" target="_blank">18176545</a>]<br></li>
<li>This positive iron-regulation was somewhat surprising , because Fur exerts its mode of regulation by repression Fur interacted with the rcnAp promoter in vivo Gene expression of rcnR responded to iron and RcnR may function as a negative regulator .

<li>Subsequent transfer of the F19 fragment into pBR - ∆ in the orientation yielding the ygaC `` -- `` tet fusion and analysis of the tet expression from the pBR - ∆ derivative in Fur + and Fur − strains showed that regulation of the ygaC promoter by iron depends on Fur ( Table 4 ; pBR - ∆ F19-A ) .

<li>To explore the mechanism by which the iron concentration in the growth medium regulates the expression of orf78 and the involvement of Fur in this regulation , the F63 fragment was inserted in pBR - ∆ ( plasmid pBR - ∆ F63-A ) and the expression of the orf78 `` -- `` tet fusion was analysed in Fur + and Fur − backgrounds .

<li>Our results are entirely consistent with their ﬁndings and extend them to demonstrate that the positive regulation by Fur and iron can be mimicked by ectopic expression of RyhB alone .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , given our previous ﬁndings that OxyR regulates the expression of the iron metabolism regulator Fur , possible OxyR regulation of a putative iron reductase was of interest .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11443092" target="_blank">11443092</a>]<br></li>
<li>This direct activation of ftnA transcription by Fe2 + -- Fur through H-NS antisilencing represents a new mechanism for iron-induced gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>If transcription from the ` antisense ' promoter inhibits fzlmA expression , differential effects of Fur on the two converging promoters could provide a mechanism for the Fur - and iron-dependent activation of thefumA gene .

<li>In high-iron conditions , Fur represses transcription of ryhB ( Massé & Gottesman , 2002 ; Vassinova & Kozyrev , 2000 ) , leading to an increase in iron storage and a decrease in shikimate uptake .

<li>However , a remaining paradox in fur auto-repression is that only metallo-Fur is able to-bind efﬁciently to Fur-boxes , that is , the transition from iron-replete to iron-deplete conditions would lead to transcription of fur under conditions where Fur requirement is not obvious .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , in low-iron conditions Fur is predominately in the apo-form , can not bind DNA , and no longer inhibits mntH transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19400769" target="_blank">19400769</a>]<br></li>
<li>In low-iron conditions , Fur no longer binds to the promoters and transcription of these same genes is derepressed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22096151" target="_blank">22096151</a>]<br></li>
<li>When Fur is not bound to iron , as is typical in low-iron media conditions , it does not repress ryhB transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22096151" target="_blank">22096151</a>]<br></li>

<li>Dimethyl sulphate ( DMS ) methyl-ation protection experiments were performed on the tonB * plasmid pKP167 in KP1052 under several sets of conditions : with or without plasmid-encoded Fur ( pMH15 ) , aerobic or anaerobic-growth , and in the presence of excess iron or the iron chelator dipyridyl .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the transcription/translation extract probably contains some free iron that is available to Fur , all anaerobic experiments were run at 35 pM EDTA , while experiments in the presence of oxygen were 10pM in EDTA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2823881" target="_blank">2823881</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , under normal conditions the presence of free iron would signal that iron import systems should be shut down , and Fur would respond accordingly .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10368155" target="_blank">10368155</a>]<br></li>

<li>DISCUSSION In addition to its role in iron acquisition , Fur is postulated to regulate general metabolic processes as well as adaptation to acid stress ( 24 , 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852058" target="_blank">9852058</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , suf is regulated by OxyR and Fur , which are optimized to sense hydrogen peroxide stress and iron starvation , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15101990" target="_blank">15101990</a>]<br></li>
<li>In V.cholerae , viuB belongs to the iron-acquisition locus vuiAiuBviuF shown to be regulated by Fur ( 35 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>In light of this , we would like to suggest another possible role for the observed Fur synthesis under iron-limiting conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>In E. coli moderate levels of manganese rescue the activities of mono-nuclear iron enzymes when iron is scarce , but high levels inappropriately activate Fur and eliminate heme synthesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25774656" target="_blank">25774656</a>]<br></li>
<li>Possibly , ongoing Fur synthesis could ensure a rapid conversion of inactive apo-Fur , synthesized during iron limitation , into metallo-Fur , and thus a quick response to reach iron homeostasis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taking this in consideration , it is conceivable that apo-Fur present or synthesized upon iron limitation ( Figure 7 ) binds to residual metallo-Fur by dimerization , which in turn could lead to non-functional dimers , and thus , to an accelerated uptake of iron .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , in a wild-type strain both RcnR and Fur had to be present to inhibit induction of rcnA by iron ( Figures 5 , 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17120142" target="_blank">17120142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Iron-bound Fur could not have mediated the repressive action of Fur in manganese-replete MntS-overproducing cells , since iron was vanishingly scarce .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25774656" target="_blank">25774656</a>]<br></li>
<li>These incongruous results suggest that while wrwycr treatment caused accumulation of chelatable iron in the cell , iron was not available to-bind to Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22096151" target="_blank">22096151</a>]<br></li>
<li>Combined with our other findings , this suggests that while wrwycr treatment increases chelatable iron in the cell , this iron is not available to Fur or KatG and that additional iron must be imported to rescue cells from the effects of wrwycr .

<li>A further explanation for the activation of Fur is that the sudden increase in intracellular Zn is sensed as a surfeit of iron .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , an increase in Fur levels under these conditions could be adverse , as Fur could compete for intracellular iron with the essential iron-containing enzymes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , genes required for biosynthesis of the siderophore entero-cheiin -- also known as enterobactin -- ( Fleming ef aL , 1983 ) , the high affinity outer membrane receptors for active transport of iron-siderophore compiexes across the outer membrane ( Hantke , 1981 ; Bindereif and Neilands , 1985 ) , and the binding protein-dependent cytoplasmic membrane iron transport proteins are aii negativeiy regulated at the levei of transcription by the Fur repressor protein ( Brickman ef ai .

<li>A similar unspecificity for divalent cations in vitro is exhibited by Fur with Co21 , Cd21 , Cu21 , Fe21 , Mn21 , or Zn21 and by DtxR and IdeR with Cd21 , Co21 , Fe21 , Mn21 , Ni21 , or Zn21 acting as corepressors in DNase I footprinting experiments ( 8 , 24 , 35 , 36 ) , although the response of Fur - or IdeR-regulated genes is clearly iron-specific in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10816566" target="_blank">10816566</a>]<br></li>
<li>Many iron transport genes and several carbon metabolic genes are subject to dual control , being repressed by the loss of Crp and activated by the loss of Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the iron-regulated protein A ( irgA ) in V.cholerae is repressed by Fur and activated by IrgB , the yersiniabactin biosynthesis genes are under negative control by Fur and YbtA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this context expression of both sod genes is under control of the Fur protein , which in the presence of sufficient iron represses the transcription of genes involved in iron assimilation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20075074" target="_blank">20075074</a>]<br></li>
<li>In E.coli , in the presence of iron , Fur binds DNA and represses the transcription of all genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis and transport except for tonB and exbBD ( 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur has been shown to regulate over ninety genes in Escherichia coli in response to changes from growth in iron deplete to iron replete conditions [ 13 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25369000" target="_blank">25369000</a>]<br></li>
<li>Given that 2 + E. coli accrue zinc and iron to similar levels under most growth conditions , the small number of Zur regulated genes stands in contrast to the copious number of genes regulated by E. coli Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25369000" target="_blank">25369000</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although there is a long list of bacterial genes and operons which are regulated by iron by means of the Fur protein ( 14 , 17 , 21 , 27 ) , important features of the repression mechanism remain obscure .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9573216" target="_blank">9573216</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , when iron concentrations fall below a certain threshold , Fur becomes inactive and repression of iron acquisition genes is relieved .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>At the same time , inactivation of Fur repression in low iron will allow the synthesis of iron uptake genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here we show not only that the iron-acquisition systems are Fur-controlled , but also that some of the direct virulence determinants such as adhesins or toxin-production genes probably are under Fur control .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , Fur is able to induce the expression of some genes under high iron conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>

<li>When the intracellular iron has reached a sufficient level , Fur becomes activated and represses the siderophore biosynthesis genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17542919" target="_blank">17542919</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur is known to repress many iron transport system-encoding genes under conditions of iron sufﬁciency ( 50 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>

<li>Under iron shortage conditions , Fur is inactivated by the release of the iron cofactor and the genes under Fur control are induced .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>When iron becomes scarce in the cell , Fur is inactivated by the release of the iron cofactor , and genes under Fur control are transcribed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>In gram-negative bacteria and in gram-positive bac - teria with a low GC content , the genes encoding iron uptake proteins are negatively regulated by Fur ( ferric uptake regula - tor ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11466284" target="_blank">11466284</a>]<br></li>
<li>Increased transcription of known transcriptional factors such as Fur may indicate on one side that genes involved in iron uptake are highly repressed ; accordingly , two of the most Fur-negatively regulated genes , gltA and the operon including sufA , sufB , and sufS , are highly repressed ( 30 ) ( supplemental Table III ; see `` Discussion '' ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16418169" target="_blank">16418169</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since transcription of mntH is additionally repressed by iron via Fur ( 22 , 26 , 38 ) , we next examined whether mntS was also regulated by iron .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21908668" target="_blank">21908668</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of fecIR is repressed by iron and the Fur protein but is unaffected by ferric citrate , while fecABCDE transcription is regulated by iron and Fur and by ferric citrate via FecI and FecR ( 3 , 12 ) .

<li>Formally speaking , the sdhCDAB operon is positively regulated by Fur repressor and iron .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>Later it was found out that Fur in addition regulated genes of the oxidative-stress response , iron metabolism , and virulence determinants from pathogenic bacteria ( Hantke and Braun , 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11931550" target="_blank">11931550</a>]<br></li>

<li>Since members of the Fur modulon are regulated by iron and Fur in conjunction , only those genes that were 2-fold regulated by both dip and the fur mutation are considered further here .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>

<li>fecI and fecR cotranscription is inhibited by the iron-loaded Fur rep-ressor , which then results in a low level of transcription of the fec transport genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8602163" target="_blank">8602163</a>]<br></li>
<li>We found that FecI is essential for transcription of fec transport genes , and that fecI itself is not regulated by FecI , but is regulated by iron via Fe 2 + - Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8602163" target="_blank">8602163</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur , an ironresponsive transcriptional-regulator , plays a key role in this regulation in E. coli by repressing transcription of genes encoding iron-uptake proteins in the presence of sufficient iron ( Bagg & Neilands , 1987 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22096151" target="_blank">22096151</a>]<br></li>

<li>The ferric uptake regulator protein ( Fur ) controls the expression of genes involved in iron transport ( 14 ) , but it is also involved in the response to oxidative-stress through the regulation of superoxide dismutase genes , which , as stated above , protect against ROS ( 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24038693" target="_blank">24038693</a>]<br></li>
<li>The regulation of iron uptake is under negative control by the Fur protein , which , in the presence of its co-represssor Fe2 + , represses the transcription of all genes involved in iron metabolism ; Fur -- Fe2 + also represses the expression of the small RNA RyhB ( Masse et al. , 2002 ; Masse and Gottesman , 2002 ) , a translational repressor of genes coding for a number of iron-containing and iron storage proteins ( Geissmann and Touati , 2004 ) .

<li>Comparison between the results of the study by McHugh et al. and those of ours revealed some genes that were positively regulated by Fur and iron in their experiments but apparently not affected by RyhB expression in our experiments , suggesting that other mechanisms for positive regulation by Fur and iron must exist .

<li>Their regulation by Fur was predicted based on the following observation : the presence of FUR-boxes , the localization of the genes within large iron-acquisition loci and , in the case of its * , the conservation of the site in the genome of V.cholerae .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>Sequences similar to FUR-boxes upstream of genes with no direct function in iron acquisition Three new outer membrane ferrisiderophore and hemin receptors seem to be under Fur regulation in the genomes of Y.pestis and V.cholerae : omrA * , hasR * ( Y.pestis ) and VCA0625 ( V.cholerae ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>We tested whether the iron regulation of hemoglobin utili-zation was also controlled by the Fur repressor , as is the case for many iron-regulated genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9171402" target="_blank">9171402</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because RyhB is normally negatively regulated by Fur and iron , negative regulation by RyhB of this large number of targets would also be expected to be detected as positive regulation by Fur and iron in global examinations of Fur-regulated genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>As the metallo-Fur-Fur equilibrium determines the active state of the repressor , negative regulation of iron acquisition genes by Fur does not occur under iron-lim-iting conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14617150" target="_blank">14617150</a>]<br></li>
<li>This response would be what one would expect , given the requirement for iron for bacterial growth and the regulation of these genes by Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17526711" target="_blank">17526711</a>]<br></li>
<li>Crp regulation of Fur-controlled genes and Fur regulation of Crp-controlled genes could allow integration of signals for iron and carbon sufﬁciency .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the regulation of some iron-storage and intracellular iron-usage genes by Fur was previously recognized , the basis for this regulation is now explained by Fur regulation of RyhB synthesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>The proteins whose synthesis it activates include Dps , which suppresses Fenton chemistry by sequestering unincorporated iron ; Fur , which restores control of iron import ; and the Suf system , which helps to maintain the activities of Fe/S enzymes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19400769" target="_blank">19400769</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , Fur controls the concentration of iron in the cells , while Arc and Fnr control aerobic/anaerobic respiration , which require iron for the synthesis of heme/nonheme proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is remarkable that in vivo Fur oan repress sodA both in anaerobiosis and in aerobiosis , but , whereas anaerobic repression is strong and can almost completely blook transcription , the aerobic repression is weak , presumably because the Fur iron oofaotor , reduced Fe ( ll ) , is less abundant in oxidative conditions ( Compan and Touati , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>In aerobiosis , ArcA repression of sodA is totally relieved , but Fur can still partially block sodA transcription , modulating its expression in response to the iron concentration of the environment .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>As a working model , it is tempting to speculate that it is only when ArcA repression is relieved , i.e. when toxic oxygen derivatives are produced as byproducts of aerobic metabolism and iron becomes a threat , that Fur would start to play a role in regulating sodA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>Cellular responses against ROS include the scavenging of reactive species via peroxidases and superoxide dismutases , the sequestration and storage of free unincorporated iron by proteins ( ferritins , Dps , and bacterioferritins ) ( 4 , 11 ) , the increased import of manganese by MntH against H2O2 stress , and the repression of iron import by the iron regulator Fur ( 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24038693" target="_blank">24038693</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results are consistent with RyhB directly targeting sodB mRNA for rapid degradation by RNase E ( 29 , 33 ) while only indirectly repressing exbBD by increasing available iron and therefore increasing Fur repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of iron ( Fe ) , Fur is inactive , RyhB is synthesized and binds to and inhibits translation of multiple targets , including a number of mRNAs encoding iron-binding proteins as well as of uof .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>We reasoned that RyhB overproduction , by down-regulating the synthesis of many iron-binding proteins , may increase the intracellular iron concentration , thereby leading to more complete Fur repression of these genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nonetheless , we ﬁnd that even within 15 min , there is enough decrease in the synthesis of Fe-binding proteins to lead to increased Fur repression , most probably by intracellular iron sparing .

<li>Instead , the histone-like nucleoid-associated protein ( H-NS ) mediates the Fur dependence of ftnA through a Fur-antagonized repression mechanism : H-NS was found to directly repress ftnA transcription in vitro and this repression was reversed by Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our data suggest that one way the Fur protein mediates this effect on HPI and HPII activity is by repressing the transcription of katE and katG , beginning at log-phase and increasing through stationary phase , and that repression of katG transcription is greater than that of katE .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15878120" target="_blank">15878120</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur counteracts H-NS repression of ftnA transcription in vitro To discover whether interaction of Fur and H-NS with the ftnA promoter region directly affects ftnA transcription , in vitro transcription reactions were performed using a PCR-ampliﬁed ftnA promoter fragment specifying a 370 nt ftnA transcript ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>The reversal of H-NS-mediated repression by Fur was speciﬁc for the ftnA promoter since Mn2 + -- Fur could not reverse H-NS repression of proU in vitro transcription ( not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , reversal of H-NS repression at the ftnA promoter required both Mn2 + and Fur showing that Fur needs its co-effector to achieve the observed antirepression effect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , it is unclear how this effect is exerted , and whether or not H-NS and Fur act directly at the ftnA promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>In summary , the above data suggest that both H-NS and Fur act directly upon the ftnA promoter to mediate iron-dependent induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>The quantiﬁcation of the transcripts with different Fur concentrations ( Fig. 2B ) indicated that repression followed a two-step pattern ; a signiﬁcant decrease in promoter activity was achieved in the range of 100 nM Fur , while further repression required over 300 nM Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9573216" target="_blank">9573216</a>]<br></li>
<li>The DNA changes its mobility from the Fur concentration of 100 nM suggesting that the repression of pyrC activity in the fur + genetic background could be due to the direct interaction of the Fur protein with the regulatory region of the pyrC promoter ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18176545" target="_blank">18176545</a>]<br></li>
<li>The predicted activity profile of Fur exhibits a transient behaviour , with a rapid increase in activity levels followed by a slow decrease to return it close to the initial state after 30 min ( Fig. 5d ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here , the profile is explained by a combination of the two regulators ' profiles ( shown in Fig. 5 ) : for zinT , the initial decrease is given by Zur repression , while the final decline is given by the effect of Fur ( which activates zinT ) .

<li>S4 in the supplemental material ) , - galactosidase activity from PsufA-lacZ never reached levels that occurred in the absence of Fur repression , e.g. , PsufA ( Fur * ) - lacZ ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown in Fig. 2c , the lack of fur caused a three - to fourfold increase in the ( hmpEc - ` lacZ ) activity levels suggesting a role for Fur in hmpEc repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17024490" target="_blank">17024490</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , mntH induction by 2,2 - dipyridyl treatment was increased in the mntR strain , due to an effective lack of both Fur and MntR activities .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21908668" target="_blank">21908668</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , mutating the Fur binding site within PsufA ( 26ATA 24 relative to the TSS was changed to 26TAT 24 ) , which decreased Fur repression of suf ( Fig. 2B and D ) , also had no effect on the ability to recover iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx mutants .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Using fur , mntR , and fur mntR mutant strains as well as mutations in the Fur - and MntR-binding motif elements , we found that Fe2 can also mediate repression through the Mn2 repressor MntR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Yet , ﬁnally , mutation of both the MntR and Fur proteins also abolishes Mn2 repression ( Fig. 4F ) , which implies that Fur is the only other trans-acting factor involved .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , mutation of the MntR-binding motif alone abolishes Mn2 repression ( Fig. 4D ) ; hence the possible interaction of a Mn2 - liganded Fur protein with the Fur-binding motif does not appear to be 2 sufﬁcient to mediate Mn repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Further , mutation of the MntR protein and Fur-binding motif also abolishes Mn2 repression ( Fig. 4F ) ; hence the Fur protein does not appear to mediate repression by binding to the MntR-binding motif .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>While the wild-type mntH : : lacZ reporter was strongly repressed by addition of Fe2 at concentrations of 1 M or greater , this repression was diminished but not eliminated when either the Fur protein or the Fur-binding motif in the promoter or both were mutated ( Fig. 4A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus both the Fur protein and the Fur-binding motif are involved in Fe2 - dependent , but not in acid-dependent , regulation of mntH .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Except for slight differences in dose response among the three Fur circuit mutants in Fig. 4A , our data are consistent 2 with the hypothesis that residual Fe repression of mntH in Fur protein and/or Fur-binding motif mutants is straightforward regulation by MntR , acting through the MntR-binding motif using Fe2 as a cofactor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our results suggest that Fur is required for Crp-dependent repression and that in the absence of Fur , Crp activates gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the absence of Fur resulted in constitutive expression , anaerobic repression was Fur dependent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Glucose-independent highlevel expression in the absence of Crp and Fur may occur if IclR repression is dependent on an interaction with either Crp or Fur or both .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>While the direct target sodB mRNA disappeared within 3 min after RyhB expression , the decrease in exbBD mRNA ( due to increased Fur repression ) was detectable by 7 min .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , repression of the Fur regulon by Fur : Mn also blocked expression of RyhB ( S15 Fig .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25774656" target="_blank">25774656</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , if the binding occurs in vivo , the significantly lower affinity of Fur for the fur promoter will cause a much weaker repression offur gene expression as compared to its aerobactin counterpart .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2836193" target="_blank">2836193</a>]<br></li>
<li>When both fepA promoters were inactivated , however , there was no increase in fes expression , and Fur exhibited a stronger repression of the fes promoter ( 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11222606" target="_blank">11222606</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , in S. enterica serovar 2 Typhimurium , we see signiﬁcant Fe repression when either component of the Fur regulatory circuit has been disrupted ( Fig. 4A ) , but only when the MntR circuit is intact .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , Fe2 repression via the MntR circuit alone produces somewhat different dose-re-2 sponse curves than Fe repression through the Fur circuit alone ( Fig. 4A and C ) ; the E. coli studies examined only a single cation concentration .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , increasing positive values may mean more repression for TFs that act mainly as repressors ( e.g. Fur is primarily a repressor , therefore more activity implies more repression ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>In all repression assays ( the methods used are described in reference 13 ) , Mn21 was used instead of Fe21 as a cofactor for Fur , owing to its superior stability in an aerobic environment .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9573216" target="_blank">9573216</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alternatively , MntS could affect mntH repression by altering cellular manganese pools and global availability , which would perturb MntR and/or Fur activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21908668" target="_blank">21908668</a>]<br></li>
<li>This H-NS-mediated repression was reversed by addition of Mn2 + -- Fur at 100 nM ( Fig. 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>For this set of experiments , 50 % repression was achievedwith 0.72 pg of unpurified Fur , vs. 0.21 pg of purified Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2823881" target="_blank">2823881</a>]<br></li>
<li>Attributing residual Mn2 repression to the normal Fur regulatory circuit is more problematic .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>

<li>This remaining regulation likely is due to mntH repression by Mnloaded Fur protein , given that manganese repression is completely lost in a mntR fur double mutant background ( 22 , 26 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21908668" target="_blank">21908668</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two pathways for Fe2 + -- Fur induction in E. coli It is interesting to note that while many Fe2 + -- Fur-induced genes ( e.g. bfr , acnA , sodB , sdh , nuo ) are RyhB dependent , ftnA is the ﬁrst example of a gene with a deﬁned alternative Fe2 + -- Fur induction pathway in E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>RyhB appears to act as a Fur-repressed repressor mediating the Fe2 + -- Fur induction of gene expression in E. coli ( Massé and Got-tesman , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>Induction of the ferritin gene ( ftnA ) of Escherichia coli by Fe2 - Fur is mediated by reversal of H-NS silencing and is RyhB independent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21908668" target="_blank">21908668</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nearly all of the Fe2 - Fur induced genes in Table II require the anaerobic regulator , Fnr , and anaerobiosis for full induction ( 31 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Fe2 - Fur induced genes listed in Table II are not essential and the observed reductions in their expression during aerobic-growth would not be expected to lead to a major growth defect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>2 The induction of expression by the Fe - Fur complex is likely to be indirect since for most of the Fe2 - Fur induced genes ( Tables I , II , and IV ) , there appear to be no associated Fur boxes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , a heatshock gene cluster ( hslTS-yidE ) was Fe2 - Fur repressed ( average 3.7-fold ) , while a group of cold-shock genes ( cspI , cspB , and cspF ) within a phage gene cluster was induced ( average 2.7-fold ) by the Fe2 - Fur complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>Note that all four of the above Fe2 - Fur repressed gene clusters are associated with predicted Fur boxes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ydiE gene is associated with a well predicted Fur box and its homologue ( hemP ) in S. typhimurium is Fur repressed ( 28 ) , supporting the Fe2 - Fur dependent regulation observed here .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>It has been shown [ 5 ] that Mn2 ' - activated Fur binds to DNA in a similar way to Fe2 + - activatedFur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1849822" target="_blank">1849822</a>]<br></li>
<li>Here we show that the Fur repressor activated by Mn2 + ( used instead of Fe2 + ) binds to the promoter of the regulatory genes fecIR and to the promoter of fecABCDE .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9575233" target="_blank">9575233</a>]<br></li>
<li>What is clear is that a transporter exclusively dedicated to the uptake of Mn2 is repressed strongly , via normal Fur regulation , by the minor and physiologically unimportant substrate Fe2 ( 23a ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>In agreement with the data of Patzer and Hantke ( 34 ) , there is no evidence for metal regulation other than by Mn2 and Fe2 acting through MntR and Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>These authors interpreted their data to indicate that Fur and MntR are strictly speciﬁc for Fe2 and Mn2 , respectively , in E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that the purpose of the adjacent loweraffinity Fur boxes is to block access to an increasing region of DNA surrounding Fur box II , as Fe2 + -- Fur levels rise , to enhance the activation of ftnA expression in a quantiﬁed manner with respect to intracellular Fe2 + concentration .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>This activation appears to be indirect and seems to involve ( at least in some cases ) the Fe2 - Fur repressed regulatory RNA , RyhB ( 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>This seems unlikely , since direct activation of transcription by Fur in E. coli has not been shown conclusively but rather occurs indirectly through the RyhB sRNA or H-NS protein ( 29 , 32 , 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21908668" target="_blank">21908668</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , expression of tonB and exbD/exbB , which are repressed by Fur and encode proteins involved in Fe uptake and enterochelin uptake respectively , decrease up to sixfold between 0 and 10 min but , after 30 min , return to the same level as immediately prior to Zn addition .

<li>To enhance the difference in the level of cat expression between the cells transformed with pUC19 and Fur-box-containing plasmids we tried to ﬁnd a leaky fur mutation that would reduce the afinity of Fur for the fhuA promoter and , thereby , allow Fur to be titrated more easily by a Fur box introduced on a multicopy plasmid .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11101675" target="_blank">11101675</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hfq inhibits fur expression in vivo To verify the observed inhibition of Fur synthesis in vitro ( Fig. 2 ) , we tested whether induction of the plasmid-borne hfq gene in strain IM1101F cents ( see Fig. 3A ) correlates with a decreased de novo Fur synthesis rate in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14617150" target="_blank">14617150</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the level of expression of the sodB ' - ` IacZ gene on pDM28 was only slightly depressed in SodB - strains , sodB is probably not significantly autoregulated ; moreover , this fusion gene was only modestly regulated by fur ( Fur + / Fur - ratio , -3 to 5 ) ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Increasing the concentration of Fe in L broth-glucose from -10 to 50 , uM Fe had no effect on the expression of the sodB fusion gene in any of these strains ( data not shown ) , although treatment of Fur ' cells with DTPA diminished the levels of P-galactosidase to Fur-levels ( Fig. 3 ) ; the latter result suggests that very different observed plasmid copy numbers are not responsible for the differences between Fur ' and Fur - cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Second , by lowering the Fe in the culture medium , through treatment with DTPA , expression of sodB ' - ` lacZ in Fur ' cells was lowered to that in Fur - cells ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>To determine if the Fur protein is involved in an H2O2-dependent pathway that regulates HPI activity through katG transcription , we examined the effect of H2O2 on HPI activity and b-galactosidase expression from a katG : : lacZ promoter fusion in the Dfur mutant and in its isogenic wild-type parent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15878120" target="_blank">15878120</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that an oxyR-dependent antioxidant defense system is essentially unaltered in the Dfur mutant and that the Fur protein is not required for the OxyR-dependent regulation of katG expression leading to HPI activity , although further experiments with oxyR strains need to be performed to conﬁrm this .

<li>Our data , together with the fact that expression of the purR repressor , a regulatory protein for the pur regulon and for genes involved in pyrimidine synthesis ( He et al. , 1993 ) , is under Fur control ( Stojiljkovic et al. , 1994 ) , give evidence in support of the involvement of Fur in the regulation of the synthesis of ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides .

<li>The increased IscR protein levels present in a iscSUA-hscBA-fdx mutant are critical for this regulation ; we demonstrated that by elevating the cellular concentration of IscR , a corresponding increase in suf expression occurs even when Fur is present .

<li>Becausefur plays a dominant role in cellular regulation ( 3 , 9 , 15 , 25 , 28 , 59 ) and null mutations may be highly pleiotro-pic , the question arises as to whether the effect of fur on sodB expression results from a direct interaction of Fur protein with the DNA of sodB , its mRNA , or its apo protein .

<li>Thus , under anaerobic conditions , the simultaneous inactivation of fur and arcA/B genes resulted in expression of sodA-lacZ , which is in agreement with the conclusion that ArcA/B and Fur are negative regulators ( i.e. , repressors ) of the sodA gene ( 18 , 19 ) .

<li>Together with weak Fur DNA direct interaction , it is also possible that Fur indirectly controls PyrC expression via PurR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18176545" target="_blank">18176545</a>]<br></li>

<li>However , open complex formation in the presence of RNA polymerase , which is an indication for active FNR and transcriptional activation , is stimulated by Fe ( II ) Most of the FNR-dependent promoters are regulated by FNR in cooperation with other regulators such as NarL , NarP ( nitrate regulation ) , ArcA , Fur ( ferric uptake regulation ) , or CRP ( cyclic AMP receptor protein , glucose repression ) ( Table 2 ) .

<li>Indeed , the Fe dependence ( metal chelate treatment ) of + ( sodA ' - ` IacZ ) regulation in Fur ' cells and the presence of an apparent iron box in this gene support the notion that repression of sodA by fur occurs through a mechanism similar to that of otherfur-regulated genes ( 2 , 3 , 9 , 14-16 , 25 , 26 , 39 , 41 , 44 , 46 , 58 ) .

<li>We asked whether RyhB could be responsible for the positive regulation of these genes by Fur , as it is for sdhCDAB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is possible that in some cases , regulation is at both transcription initiation , by direct Fur repression , and postinitiation , by positive regulation by RyhB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>This repression is in agreement with the strong Fur regulation reported by Stojiljkovic et al. ( 16 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11443092" target="_blank">11443092</a>]<br></li>
<li>Iron regulation of fecIR transcription and , consequently , of fecABCDE transcription was demonstrated , but whether the fecABCDE promoter responds to Fe2 + -- Fur has not been studied .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9575233" target="_blank">9575233</a>]<br></li>
<li>Effects of deletions in the sodB promoter on sensitivity to Fur regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>While the sodB promoter elements involved in Fur-mediated regulation clearly emerged from our data , the mechanism of Fur activation remains obscure .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , Fur and MntR regulation is sufﬁcient to account for all observed cation regulatory effects .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>

<li>Transcriptional regulation of sitABCD of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium by MntR and Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21908668" target="_blank">21908668</a>]<br></li></div>
<li>It has also an upstream candidate FUR-box and , given its function , is likely to be under the regulation of Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , H-NS negative regulation operated only in the absence of Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>This means that Fur regulation is dependent upon Fe2 + and H ' .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2015825" target="_blank">2015825</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggested that the regulation of ftnA by Fur is indirect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>This precluded a physical interaction with Fur as prerequisite for RcnR-mediated regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17120142" target="_blank">17120142</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , Fur regulation of both promoters was drastically reduced .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , in this case the involvement of Fur in regulation was not conﬁrmed by a more direct fashion .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11101675" target="_blank">11101675</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , when both proteins were added simultaneously the two transcripts were repressed also ( Fig. 3A , lane 3 ) , albeit to a slightly lesser extent than when Fur was added ﬁrst .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9573216" target="_blank">9573216</a>]<br></li>
<li>There is also a discrepancy between the data of Table 2 , according to which FeSOD appears to be strongly repressed ( .20 - fold ) in Fur - compared with Furt cells , and the fusion gene data shown in Fig. 3 , in which the ratio is -2 - to 3-fold .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>As also revealed by the data in Table 2 , the loss of Fur function completely abolished the effect of Cra under both conditions tested .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8824175" target="_blank">8824175</a>]<br></li>
<li>An sodB ' - ` lacZ fusion gene borne on either a low - or high-copy plasmid yielded approximately two-to threefold more j-galactosidase activity in Fur ' compared with Fur - cells ; the levels of activity depended only weakly on the growth-phase and did not change during an extended stationary phase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Indeed , we also find that treating cells with metal-chelating agents that do not inhibit growth , such as DTPA , significantly derepressed sodA ' - ` lacZ in Fur ' but not in Fur-strains ( Fig. 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Second , sodA was substantially derepressed in Fur - cells in comparison with Fur ' cells ; during the period of balanced growth there was approximately threefold more sodA ' - ` lacZ gene product in the Fur - strain than in the Fur ' strain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of the chromosomal fusion gene 4 ( sodA ' - ` lacZ ) as a function of in growth isogenic Fur ' and Fur - strains of E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>The availability of sodA mutants in Fur ' and Fur - cells allowed us to quantify accumulation of FeSOD in stationary-phase cells without interference from MnSOD activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>There appears to be a small decrease in P-galactosidase activity during expo nential growth , with a return of activity as the cells approach stationary phase ; overnight cultures of the Fur ' and Fur-strains had specific activities of 830 + 80 ( Fur ' ) and 340 ± 30 ( Fur - ) U/A6 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Measurement of FeSOD activity in logarithmic growth-phase and in overnight cultures of sodA and fur sodA backgrounds revealed that almost no FeSOD activity was expressed in Fur - strains , whereas wild-type levels were expressed in Fur ' cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>FeSOD levels were atypical in Fur - cells ( virtually absent ) and normal in Fur ' cells , whereas MnSOD levels in both Fur ' and Fur - strains appeared to be roughly equal and typical of cells harvested in the stationary phase of growth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>The approximately fivefold-lower FeSOD activity in cells bearing pMN3 is consistent with the idea that Fur protein may bind to the sodB promoter , although indirect control is not excluded .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>It follows that Fur - cells containing multiple copies of a transcribable DNA molecule capable of lowering the concentration of this putative repressor protein , such as the sodB promoter , should express FeSOD activity ; this did not occur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , if Fur is a direct activator , plasmids able to-bind Fur should lower FeSOD activity in Fur ' cells but have no effect in Furcells ; this was observed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , if the Fur protein is itself an activator of sodB expression , lowering intracellular Fur levels , by transformation with a multicopy plasmid known to-bind holo Fur , should lead to a decrease in FeSOD activity in Fur ' cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur + and Fur - cells bearing the multicopy plasmid pHS1-4 ( sodB + ) expressed approximately sevenfold less FeSOD activity in the fur background , and staining of nondenaturing electrophoretic gels indicates that synthesis of FeSOD protein was greatly reduced in Fur - cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>If Fur is positively regulating sodB at transcription , a plasmid bearing fur ' should restore FeSOD activity in Fur - cells ; this was observed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>As to the well-established inductive effect of pQ2 + , Fur ' and Fur - cells , containing sodA ' - ` IacZ and growing in the same conditions and at the same rates ( Fig. 2 ) , were similarly induced for , B-galactosi-dase in the presence of 20 puM pQ2 + .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>As expected , the absolute level of activity was much lower in anaerobically grown cells ( compare aerobic Fur ' cells grown to an Awo of 1.7 having 320 U/A6 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , in anaerobic conditions , Fur - cells have approximately fourfold more activity than Fur ' cells ( compare Fur - cells grown to an A600 of 1.3 having 34 U/A600 with Fur ' cells grown to an A600 of 1.5 having 7 U/A6w ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>A similar effect was seen in Fur ' cells grown under anaerobic conditions ( compare Fur ' cells grown in the absence of DTPA to an A6 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , at an A600 of -1 , cells growing without and with pQ2 + had increased Pgalactosidase activity ( Fur ' , 300 to 1,600 U/A6o0 ; Fur - , 1,200 to 2,500 U/A600 , respectively ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>When grown on X-Gal plates , Fur - cells bearing this plasmid , pMN3 , were light blue whereas Fur ' cells bearing the plasmid formed dark blue colonies .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Note that there was approximately two - to threefold more P-galactosidase activity in Fur ' cells compared with Fur - cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , Fur ' and Fur - cells grew at essentially identical rates in this medium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>

<li>As expected , the presence of pABN203 ( Furt ) increased the activity of FeSOD in Fur - cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the presence of this plasmid decreased FeSOD activity in Fur ' cells , indicating that the plasmid does not restore the paren-tal condition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>In E.coli it is repressed by Fur , ArcA , Fnr and integration host factor IHF , and it is activated by the product of the soxRS locus and mutated alleles of soxQ locus ( such as CfxB ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>Comparison of the different Fur forms yields essential information on the structural reorganization of this important E. coli global regulator during dimerization and activation processes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16690618" target="_blank">16690618</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our data do not provide overwhelming evidence for direct activation of sodB by Fur , but there are three lines of evidence which support direct control .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>We measured b-galactosi-dase activity from a F ( sodB-lacZ ) 2 fusion in anaerobiosis and found Fur activation by a factor of about seven , as in aerobiosis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , Fur activation was also not affected by the F ( sodB-lacZ ) 11 fusion , in which the 235 box was also deleted ( see below ) , locating cis-acting activation elements downstream from position 225 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>Likewise , H O still activated 2 2 mntH : : lacZ when either the Fur or MntR systems had been inactivated by a cis - or trans-acting mutation ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>DISCUSSION FeSOD synthesis , which was initially thought to be unregulated and then to be possibly activated by Fur ( 29 ) , now appears to be under the control of multiple trans - and cis-regula-tory elements .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>In light of the absence of data suggesting a role for Fur as a positive effector , the activation of the yhhY promoter under conditions when Fur is also active could be explained by participation of another repressor , which in its turn is negatively regulated by Fur , in the regulation of yhhY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11101675" target="_blank">11101675</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to bfr , fhuABCD , and sdhCDAB , there are several other known Fe2 - Fur regulated genes ( acnA , flbB , fumA , fumB , fumC , purR , nohB , sodA , ygaC , and yhhX ) that were not affected by dip and Fur in this study .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to its role as a repressor , Fur was characterized as a positive regulator of genes such as acnA , fumA , ftnA , bfr , and sodB ( 22 , 20 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>From newly developed genome analyses , wide variety of gene group was identified as Fe2 + - Fur regulated in Materials and Methods Bacterial strains and growth conditions Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 .

<li>Fur-dependent promoter activity of new genes belonging to the Fur regulon of E. coli To prove that the chromosomal fragments cloned in FUR-SEL1 possess promoter activities regulated by Fur , the inserts of pEF19 , pEF20 , pEF29 and pEF34 were transferred into the promoter probe vector pBR - ∆ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11101675" target="_blank">11101675</a>]<br></li>
<li>In our MS analysis , we found only five OxyR-regulated proteins ( supplemental Table S1 ) : all three catalases of E. coli ( AhpF , KatG , and KatE ) ; OxyR itself , which is down-regulated by oxi-dative stress ; and Fur , which is up-regulated by OxyR but is also a usual contaminant during His tag purification ( 32 , 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23139412" target="_blank">23139412</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , the expression of Dpr in S. mutans was differentially increased by acid exposure ( 54 ) , and in Salmonella , Dps was reported to be regulated by Fur ( 28 ) , which was shown in an earlier study to be essential for acid resistance ( 63 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20305033" target="_blank">20305033</a>]<br></li>
<li>Increasing concentrations of 2,29-dipyridyl ( 0.05 to 0.50 mM ) did not cause an increase in the expression of F ( cydD-lacZ ) either aerobically or anaerobically ( data not shown ) , and cydDC expression was not regulated by the repressor protein Fur ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9335308" target="_blank">9335308</a>]<br></li>
<li>Note that the Fe2 - Fur regulated promoter originally identified upstream of yhhX ( 8 ) appears to be specific for ryhB ( 11 ) , which would explain its lack 2 of Fe - Fur control in this work .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>It did not respond to manganese availability ; it was not induced by redox-cycling drugs , which indicates that it is not regulated by SoxR ( 16 , 47 ) ; it was not affected by Fur , IscR , Hfq , RpoS , or YaaA itself .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21378183" target="_blank">21378183</a>]<br></li>
<li>For comparison , we analysed the induction of ahpC transcripts , which are regulated primarily by OxyR , and the ryhB transcripts regulated by Fur ( Masse and Gottesman , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15009899" target="_blank">15009899</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the only OxyR target genes , sufA and fhuF , showing 5-fold induction by GSNO or NaNO2 , are known to be regulated by both Fur and OxyR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur - In a similar manner we validated the FnrS-mediated downthermore , our proteome analyses resulted in three negatively regulation of the expression of sodB , encoding the alternative and one positively regulated candidate targets .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20075074" target="_blank">20075074</a>]<br></li>
<li>In fact , whereas sodB is positively regulated by Fur , sodA ( MnSOD ) is negatively regulated ( 37 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is unexpected because , to our knowledge , almost every gene involved in siderophore biosynthesis and export is known to be regulated at the promoter level by Fur ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20696910" target="_blank">20696910</a>]<br></li>
<li>One more siderophore-biosynthesis gene cluster alcABC * is probably regulated by Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , the mntH , yebN , and dps promoters are all thought be regulated by Fur and/or OxyR in addition to MntR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21239586" target="_blank">21239586</a>]<br></li>
<li>Among these proteins , the synthesis of Fur , FeSOD and MetF was negatively controlled by Hfq , whereas the synthesis of GapA and PpiB was positively regulated by Hfq ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14617150" target="_blank">14617150</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of FeSOD and MnSOD are regulated by Fur ( ferric uptake regulon ) [ 1,2 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16183297" target="_blank">16183297</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whereas FeSOD is positively regulated by Fur , MnSOD is negatively regulated by this protein ( 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>Of these , only nrdH , sodB , and yhhY have previously been reported to be Fe2 - Fur regulated ( 8 , 39 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>clusters are preceded by candidate FUR-boxes and their transcription is likely to be Fur regulated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>E. coli are being shown to be Fur regulated [ 26 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15878120" target="_blank">15878120</a>]<br></li>
<li>In Y.pestis , the hms-phenotype was shown to be regulated by Fur ( 39 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>These findings suggest that pyrC is regulated by PurR , which in turn would be controlled by Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18176545" target="_blank">18176545</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , this ﬁnding suggests that the FetA and FetB transporter is not regulated by Fur directly .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24038693" target="_blank">24038693</a>]<br></li>

<li>It is predicted that correction of one of the defective hexamers would result in additional critical contacts and increased afﬁnity for Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is possible that other proteins designated as Fur homologues will turn out to be Zur proteins .

<li>It was shown previously that O-2 deactivates Fur after its conversion to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase , through Fenton reaction [ 62 ] ( H O 2 + • 2 2 + Fe ® HO + OH - + Fe3 + ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21272324" target="_blank">21272324</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is noteworthy that the single cysteine residue of P. aeruginosa Fur was shown to be dispensable for the in vivo activity of P. aeruginosa Fur by site-directed mutagenesis ( 12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16690618" target="_blank">16690618</a>]<br></li>
<li>Combination with inability to convert NADH to NAD + , a decrease in endogeneous O-2 would cause reductive stress , which may activate Fur [ 61 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21272324" target="_blank">21272324</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , a decrease in endogeneous O-2 generation would increase the availability of Fe2 + , through a decrease in H2O2 level , and in effect activate Fur relative to control [ 30 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21272324" target="_blank">21272324</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is concluded that Fur acts as a classical negative repressor that , under in vivo conditions , uses ionic Fe ( I1 ) as a corepressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2823881" target="_blank">2823881</a>]<br></li>
<li>RyhB sRNA is speciﬁcally expressed under low Fe conditions through Fur to help the cell adapt to depleted Fe conditions ( 24 -- 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20696910" target="_blank">20696910</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data indicate that even in low Fe conditions , when Fur is inactive , RyhB has a critical role in biosynthesis and/or secretion of siderophores .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20696910" target="_blank">20696910</a>]<br></li>
<li>This 2 + raises the questions : why is Fe -- Fur induction of ftnA not achieved by the RyhB route , and what distinguishes FtnA from proteins in the RyhB-dependent group ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>Simulation of the transition using equation ( 2 ) consistently shows a transient activation of Fur and an elevated final concentration of Fe , which is robust to changes in the parameters across an order of magnitude .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>Potential relationships between pQ2 + , Fe , and Fur will be difficult to sort out in a chemically defined medium , such as M9 , as Fe deficiency and pQ2 + ( 19 ) have profound effects on cell growth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur has a significantiy lower affinity for Fe ' '' ( Bagg and Neilands , 1987b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Third , Fur binds Fe '' in a pH-dependent fashion ( Saito etai , 1991b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , we can not conclude that siderophore production decreases in the ΔryhB mutant because of increased free Fe and Fur activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20696910" target="_blank">20696910</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that Fur is still active under low Fe in a ΔryhB mutant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20696910" target="_blank">20696910</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Interaction of Cadmium with Fur A study of the interaction of cadmium with Fur has provided evidencethat supportsthe model of Fur functional organization and activation outlined above .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>These examples of analogousbiochemical behavior suggest that our model of Fur functional organization and mechanism of activation is valid .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur binds to PsufA with higher afﬁnity than does holo - or apo-IscR in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , consistent with previous in vitro studies ( 15 ) , the higher binding afﬁnity of Fur can not be outcompeted by physiological changes in IscR levels .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25266384" target="_blank">25266384</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , in vivo as well as in vitro assays and spectroscopic studies suggested that a fast and irreversible inhibition of Fur occurs by nitrosylation of FeII .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur-regulated lacZ fusions were used to probe Fur activity against NO in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>To assay Fur activity against NO , a range of NO concentrations close to the estimated intracellular Fur concentration was used .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of NO , only a basic level of - gal activity was observed as a result of Fur repressor activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>We now establish direct inhibition of E. coli Fur activity by NO .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to the in vitro assays , Fur was inactivated directly by a small excess of NO .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>Results In Vivo , the Activity of Fur Repressor Is Sensitive to NO .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur Is Nitrosylated by NO Inside the Cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although these experiments showed inhibition of Fur activity , indirect Fur inactivation mediated by NO could not be ruled out ; thus , in vitro assays were performed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>To fully explain in vivo observations , we wondered how the interaction of NO with FeFur could lead to the inactivation of Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>This interaction was corroborated by the co-puri-fication of Fur with His6-Crl and the activation of fur transcription by Crl and Fur observed in - galactosidase assays .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , as uof and fur are translationally coupled , either event would have the same consequence , that is , a decrease in Fur synthesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>Crl binds to Fur at the fur and crl promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>
<li>This mutation does prevent Fur from protecting downstream of FBS 2 , resulting in an altered species 30 , and suggesting that Fur does not bind tightly in the downstream region .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>
<li>This indicated that Fur was unable to-bind to its target sequence in the region when polymerase was engaged with the DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9573216" target="_blank">9573216</a>]<br></li>
<li>This indicated that Fur bound to the rcnR-rcnA intergenic region ( Figure 1 ) in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17120142" target="_blank">17120142</a>]<br></li>
<li>This acceleration of trypsinolysis is too small ( 1.37-fold effect for TAME ) to account for the effect observed with Fur ' trypsinolysis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>This seems somewhat less likely , since Fur is quite effective in situations when opposing promoters are not a consideration .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8021177" target="_blank">8021177</a>]<br></li>
<li>This method was applied to the isolation of Fur targets in P. aeruginosa .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11101675" target="_blank">11101675</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that Fur activation mechanisms may be different in different species .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>
<li>This indicates that one metal ion per Fur monomer is required to activate protease sensitivity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that Fur assumes a unique conformation when more than one cadmium per monomer is bound .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the case of 43-1 versus 43-1AT and 43-5 versus 43-5AT , Fur showed similar afﬁnity for both sequences at all Fur concentrations , but with 43-7 , Fur afﬁnity was slightly higher for its AT counterpart .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the fur-28 allele , nucleotides ( nt ) 2284 to 2215 of section 62 are deleted , giving rise to an inactive Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11466284" target="_blank">11466284</a>]<br></li>
<li>In summary , our data suggest that Grx4 may be involved in an irondependent function that is independent of Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15833738" target="_blank">15833738</a>]<br></li>
<li>In 1990 , it was suggested that FeSOD synthesis is positively controlled by Fur ( 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>In our normal growing conditions , Fur was active .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>In lane A8 , Fur runs as a double band , corresponding to native Fur and His6-Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , in the absence ofoxygen both Fur and Fnr will contain Fe2 ' and will act as repressors of sodA with Fur being dominant over Fnr .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>In conclusion , Fnr , Arc , and Fur act as anaerobic repressors of sodA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>

<li>On the contrary , when Fur was added ﬁrst , transcription was signiﬁcantly and proportionally inhibited from both promoters fepA and fes ( Fig. 3A , lane 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9573216" target="_blank">9573216</a>]<br></li>
<li>Global transcription factors such as ArcA , Fnr , IHF , Fur , and CRP respond to both NADH and ATP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20299454" target="_blank">20299454</a>]<br></li>
<li>Together , these results conﬁrm that both Fur and YqjI repress transcription of yqjH .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097627" target="_blank">21097627</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thermoregulation of cirA and fes transcription occurs independently of Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17526711" target="_blank">17526711</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , we found that Fur continued to regulate nrdHIEF transcription when this sequence was removed ( Fig .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21338418" target="_blank">21338418</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , because Fur autoregulates its own transcription , Crl might act by interaction with Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , RNA polymerase seemed not to gain access to any of the promoters when Fur was bound to its target site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9573216" target="_blank">9573216</a>]<br></li>

<li>To determinewhether the effect of metal on Fur digestion by protease is specific for trypsin , the effect of MnC12 on chymotrypticcleavageof Fur was studied .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>

<li>In experiments whose results are not shown here , we titrated the structural fragments ( see Materials and Methods ) of sodA and sodB with Mn2 ' - Fur and found a small amount of nonspecific binding at 100 nM Mn2 ' - Fur and complete nonspecific binding at 500 nM protein ; the Kapp of Mn2 + - Fur to the structural fragments is -100 to 500 nM .

<li>At Fur concentrations below 10 nM , little or no binding was observed ; we therefore estimate that the concentration of Fur which results in half-maximal occupancy of the operator ( i.e. , Kd ) under these conditions is between 10 and 20 nM .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2644221" target="_blank">2644221</a>]<br></li>
<li>This efficient competition of AroA is not the consequence of non-specific competition due to the other proteins in the crude extract ; the Fur footprint never faded or disappeared in control experiments using , for competition , orude extracts in which ArcA is not overproduced ( Fig. 6b , lanes 18-20 ) .

<li>They are involved in processes as diverse as respiration , gene regulation , cofactor biosynthesis , and DNA-RNA metabolism .7 There is tremendous interest in understanding the mechanisms of Fe-S cluster biosynthesis , one reason being that several human diseases , including Friedreich 's ataxia , are the result of genetic defects in the protein machinery that makes Fe-S clusters .7 10.1021 / pr100920r 2010 American Chemical Society 6740 Journal of Proteome Research 2010 , 9 , 6740 -- 6751 Published on Web 10/11/201 The SUF system of E. coli is comprised of complex protein machinery , which , under the control of OxyR , IHF , IscR , andFur , synthesizes Fe S clusters during the potentially cytotoxic conditions of iron limitation and oxidative stress.6,11-14 ,17,18 The SUF system is encoded by the sufABCDSE operon .14 SufS is a cysteine desulfurase that mobilizes inorganic sulfur via a pyridoxal-5 ′ - phosphate cofactor and a conserved cysteine ( C ) residue and transfers the sulfur atom through a proposed persulﬁde transfer mechanism to the conserved C51 residue on the sulfur acceptor protein SufE.19-21 SufB , SufC , and SufD form a complex ( SufBC2D , hereafter referred to as SufBCD ) 22 that stimulates this cysteine desulfurase activity through an unknown mechanism ,21 though SufC is known to be an atypical ABC transporter ATPase .12 In vitro evidence suggests that SufE transfers the sulfur atom to SufB within the SufBCD complex and that SufBCD acts as a scaffold upon which an Fe-S cluster is assembled.22-24 It is not known whether the persulﬁde sulfur on SufE is liberated via nucleophilic attack by the recipient Cys thiol on the terminal sulfur of the persulﬁde , which would result in persulﬁde transfer , or via nucleophilic attack on the bridging sulfur , which would produce a disulﬁde-linked complex between SufE and the recipient protein and liberate sulﬁde that may then bind a free Cys residue for use in assembling an Fe-S cluster .5 It also remains to be determined whether the assembled cluster on SufBCD is transferred to a target apoprotein directly or via SufA.22,25-27 It is possible that SufE transfers sulfur to proteins other than SufB , as both the iron source and the means by which the sulfur on SufE is incorporated into an Fe-S cluster remain unknown .

<li>On the contrary to the single cysteine residue of P. aeruginosa Fur that was shown to be dispensable for the in vivo activity of P. aeruginosa Fur also by site-directed mutagenesis ( 12 ) .

<li>It is possible , therefore , that Crp and Fur regulate iclR expression and/or that IclR interacts with Crp and/or Fur as well as with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase alpha-subunit ( 76 ) .

<li>th spectra have been acquired NMR Characterization of Fur ZnSFurD Fur and 1.5 mM for Fur Monomer -- In case of the mono-meric Fur , the backbone resonance assignment could be achieved easily for the N-terminal domain .

<li>It is interesting to note that NorR , Fur , SoxR , and OxyR all appear to contain redox-active cysteines and , in some cases , iron .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14718666" target="_blank">14718666</a>]<br></li>
<li>To avoid formation of the monomer , DTT was added to the Fur dimer samples to maintain the cysteines in their reduced form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16690618" target="_blank">16690618</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that Fur solves the problem of sequence-specific DNA-recognition and ligand-induced activation in a manner similar to that of the classical helix-turn-helix repressors using a very different amino acid sequence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , this region is highly conserved in all Zur sequences and corresponds to the second helix in the proposed helix-turn-helix motif in Fur that has previously been suggested to mediate interactions with DNA ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10816566" target="_blank">10816566</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , a comparison of the three M9 models from these three species shows that these models are highly similar to each other ( Figure 4 ) , suggesting that the Fur -- DNA-recognition mechanism is conserved in even distantly related species .

<li>Additional hydroxyl radical footprinting studies showed dramatically different results in that Fur -- DNA contacts were found mostly on one side of the DNA helix , with the contacts extending at least three consecutive major grooves .13 0022-2836/02 / $ - see front matter q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. .

<li>Subsequent hydroxyl radical footprinting of the aerobactin operator region led to the suggestion that Fur may wrap around the operator DNA , making multiple contacts at evenly spaced ( usually A-T ) doublets on all sides of the helix , with each protected doublet separated by four intervening base pairs ( 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8021177" target="_blank">8021177</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although bases outside the 10 19-bp regions examined may also be involved in Fur recognition , the values in Fig. 4 suggest that the symmetrical adenines and thymines at positions -4 , -5 , -6 , +4 , +5 , and +6 are particularly important and are likely candidates for forming specific contacts with the protein dimer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2644221" target="_blank">2644221</a>]<br></li>
<li>+2 +2 +2 +2 +2 Recent studies have suggested that puriﬁed Fur contains +2 at least one Zn ion as a structural stabilizer ( 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although Fur has two metal-binding sites per monomer , the fact that only one molar equivalent of tightly binding metals such as Cd ( I1 ) or Ni ( I1 ) is necessary to produce maximal protease sensitivity suggests that only one of these sites is actually involved in inducing this conformational change in the protein , although it is possible that activation could actually require binding of two metals to one of the monomeric subunits of a dimeric repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Maximum protease sensitivity is observed in the presence of about one molar equivalent of Cd ( I1 ) per Fur monomer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>This indicates that one metal ion per Fur monomer is required to activate protease sensitivity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alternatively , in the absence of an opposing polymerase , the interaction of RNAP with one of the fepA promoters might be enhanced so that Fur can no longer compete effectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8021177" target="_blank">8021177</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is predicted that correction of one of the defective hexamers would result in additional critical contacts and increased afﬁnity for Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>
<li>This could seem surprising : one might think that Fur would measure the iron content of the putative pipeline that delivers iron to the clusters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10368155" target="_blank">10368155</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fact that only a subset of guanosine residues are differentially protected in the presence and absence of O2 suggests that while tighter binding is not the cause of increased anaerobic repression , Fur may undergo a conformational change , Upstream of the Fur-binding site , protection of residues at positions - 8 5 and - 8 6 compared to the in vitro control reaction , which indicates all possible DMS reactive residues , was observed under all conditions ( except Anaerobic repression of tonB transcription 947 anaerobicaiiy when iron was present in excess ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the transcription/translation extract probably contains some free iron that is available to Fur , all anaerobic experiments were run at 35 pM EDTA , while experiments in the presence of oxygen were 10pM in EDTA .

<li>Indeed , spectroscopic data on cobalt - and iron-substituted Fur indicated that the metal is hexacoordinated with one ligand at a longer distance and only nitrogen and oxygen donor ligands including two ( or three ) histidines and one ( or two ) aspartate or glutamate ( 20 , 21 ) .

<li>Because most Fur proteins contain the conserved cysteines found to be bound to the structural zinc in the E. coli protein , it seems essential to study the structural properties of the biochemically well characterized E. coli Fur .

<li>The array of histidine residues [ including the sequence His-His-His-Asp-His in the Fur protein ( Schaffer et al. , 1985 ) ] affords a likely site for coordination of transition metal ions , although this remains to be demonstrated by biophysical and chemical methods .

<li>This interaction was corroborated by the co-puri-fication of Fur with His6-Crl and the activation of fur transcription by Crl and Fur observed in - galactosidase assays .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Interaction of Cadmium with Fur A study of the interaction of cadmium with Fur has provided evidencethat supportsthe model of Fur functional organization and activation outlined above .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>The immuno-blot analysis of the imidazole eluted fraction did not reveal the presence of Fur , suggesting that the interaction between Crl and Fur is specific .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>
<li>Molecular analyses , including EMSA1 and Western blotting , suggested a possible protein-protein interaction between Crl and Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>

<li>FurC is relatively resistant to trypsinolysis ( see Figure 3C ) , which also indicates that it may be able to adopt a structure similar to the Cterminal region of intact Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>

<li>The resulting Fur ' - ` LacZ fusion protein ( predicted molecular mass , 118 kDa ) retains only 29 amino acid residues from the Fur protein ( 148 amino acids [ 9 ] ) and therefore it would not be expected to afford any Fur-related function .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2836193" target="_blank">2836193</a>]<br></li>
<li>This difference may reflect the ratio of cysteines vs histidines in each protein : Fur has 12 histidines and only 4 cysteines out of 148 amino acids , while Zur has 9 cysteines and 9 histidines out of 171 amino acids .

<li>The mode of Fur-mediated activation is unknown , but there are two potential Fur sites upstream of two putative a c n A promoter sequences in the 1004 bp y s E a c n A intergenic region ( Prodromou e t al. , 1992 ) .

<li>The acnA and oppA Fur clusters are both strong ; the former cluster has three overlapping sites of 17.6 , 9.8 and 14.2 bits , and the latter has two overlapp-ing sites of 21.5 and 9.6 bits ( Table 4 ) .

<li>The E. coli 24-site M9 model predicts two separated Fur binding clusters in the fhuF promoter region ; one cluster contains three strong sites of 16.1 , 20.8 and 22.3 bits , and the other contains two weaker sites of 14.6 and 9.3 bits ( Figure 5A ) .

<li>The predicted strong Fur binding cluster covers 91 % of the high-afinity footprinted region , and the weak Fur cluster covers 66 % of the low-afinity region ( Table 3 , Figure 5A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>

<li>The fhuF oligo used in the gel shift experiments in Figure 3 only contains the strong Fur cluster .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>
<li>The garPLRK operon has a weak Fur cluster that contains one major site of 10.4 bits .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition to a functionally important regulatory iron-binding site in the dimerisation domain , Fur also contains a structural zinc-binding site that is crucial for its function in vivo ( shown in Fig. 2 ) .

<li>The aromatic region is shown and the resonances affected are labelled Spin label binding Fur contains four reduced - SH groups , C92 , C95 , C132 and C137 , to which spin label can be covalently linked .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1849822" target="_blank">1849822</a>]<br></li>
<li>The C-terminal half of Fur contains a little histidine cluster and four cysteines two of which are binding zinc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11931550" target="_blank">11931550</a>]<br></li>
<li>The structural zinc-binding site contains a zinc ion in a tetrahedral geometry bound to two glutamic acids ( Glu80 and Glu100 ) and two histidines ( His32 and His89 ) and is therefore different from the one in E. coli Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16690618" target="_blank">16690618</a>]<br></li>

<li>The protection of these residues was independent of Fur binding , suggesting that a second factor bound to this region ( Fig. 6C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>

<li>In binding Mn ( I1 ) either the cysteines of Fur may interact very weakly with the metal so deprotonation does not take place , analogous to the interaction of Mn ( I1 ) with water at neutral or acidic pH , or an intervening water molecule is perhaps bound by Mn ( I1 ) so that cysteine does not act as a direct ligand or the metal interacts with cysteinesin some other manner .

<li>Experiments equivalent to those with the Fur protein and Fur-binding motif mutants were performed with an MntR protein mutant and an inverted-repeat motif ( MntR-binding motif ) mutant , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , mutation of the MntR-binding motif alone abolishes Mn2 repression ( Fig. 4D ) ; hence the possible interaction of a Mn2 - liganded Fur protein with the Fur-binding motif does not appear to be 2 sufﬁcient to mediate Mn repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Further , mutation of the MntR protein and Fur-binding motif also abolishes Mn2 repression ( Fig. 4F ) ; hence the Fur protein does not appear to mediate repression by binding to the MntR-binding motif .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1849822" target="_blank">1849822</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since a plausible Fur-binding motif is apparent in the mntH promoter , cis - and trans-acting Fur mutants were evaluated in add-back experiments with each metal .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is interesting to note that two of the four cysteines in Fur are found in the motif CysXYCysGly , which is present in the metal-binding centers of ferredoxins and many other metal-binding proteins ( del Cardayre & Neilands , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>This extension of protection is much shorter than the original protected sequence , and can best be explained by some overlapping of bound dimers in an interaction that is highly reminiscent of the DtxR -- DNA interaction in Corynebacterium diphtheria and other Gram-positive bacteria .28,29 Like Fur , DtxR is an iron-responsive dimer that , under high iron conditions , binds Fe ( II ) and undergoes a conformational change , allowing the protein to interact with 19-bp consensus sequences on DNA .30 -- 34 Though both proteins share little sequence homology , both are predicted to have similar secondary structures , especially in the N-terminal DNA-binding regions .35 Recent evidence has shown that both contain non-classical helix-turn-helix motifs for DNA-binding that undergo similar conformational changes upon the addition of metal .35 The crystal structure of DtxR on DNA has been solved , and it appears that two DtxR dimers recognize the 19-bp consensus sequence with each dimer associating on opposite sides of the DNA helix in an overlapping fashion .28,29 Based upon the similarities between Fur and DtxR , we predict that Fur may associate with its 19-bp consensus in a similar fashion ( Figure 7 ( a ) ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>
<li>DtxR displays little or no sequence similarity to Fur , but like Fur , has an N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain ( Pohl et al. 1998 ; 1999 ) followed by a central dimerisation domain containing two metal-binding sites one of which provides iron-sensing capability ( Figure 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16718600" target="_blank">16718600</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that the two peptides bind to Mn ( I1 ) at the same sites and that a C-terminal domain is responsiblefor metal-binding in intact Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>E. coli Fur is mainly described as a dimeric protein containing two metal-binding sites per subunit .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16690618" target="_blank">16690618</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data and the lack of internal homologies in the Fur amino acid sequence indicate that Fur probably has two nonidentical metal-binding sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>A comparison of the metal-binding sites in Zur with its Fe ( II ) - sensing homologue Fur provides clues as to why these two proteins with similar structures respond to two very different metal ions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11523983" target="_blank">11523983</a>]<br></li>
<li>A comparison of the amino acid sequences and metal-binding sites of Fur and Zur highlights a few similarities and some important differences between the two proteins ( Figure 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11523983" target="_blank">11523983</a>]<br></li>
<li>The isolation of an Nterminal fragment that binds to DNA in a manner similar to intact Fur or an X-ray structure of the ternary Fur-metal-DNA complex would be required to thoroughly test for direct metal involvement in DNA-binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>The structure of the Helicobacter pylori ferric uptake regulator Fur reveals three functional metal-binding sites .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>
<li>( A ) The crystal structure of Fur with zinc ions bound at sites 1 and 2 ; in the native state these metal-binding sites bind to iron and zinc , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16814929" target="_blank">16814929</a>]<br></li>
<li>cleavageof Fur occurs in the N-terminal region of the protein , and , in the presence of activating metal , Fur undergoes a conformationalchange that makes it more sensitive to tryp-sinolysis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>As the DNA-recognition domain in the Fur protein has a non-clas-sical , not absolutely understood structure ( 29 ) , these amino acids might play some role in the sequence-specific-DNA-binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results are consistent with in vitro studies of Fur demonstrating that binding of metal ion induces a conformational change in the DNA-binding domain of the Fur protein ( Coy and Neilands , 1991 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>Evidence will then be presented that supports the following model of the functional organization and mechanism of metal ion activation of Fur : metal is bound to a C-terminal domain of the protein , and this induces a conformational change in the N-terminal region that allows it to bind to operator DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>The model for the mechanism of metal ion activation of Fur DNA-binding that best explains the data outlined above postulates that metal-binding to Fur induces a conformational change that allows the protein to interact with DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>This may be because FurN does not contain all the sequence necessary to form a complete DNA-binding domain , although it is possible that the C-terminal metal-binding domain of Fur is also involved in the interaction of the protein with DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Isolation and characterization of biochemically generated fragments of Fur as well as other data indicate that the N-terminal region is necessary for the interaction of the repressor with DNA and that a C-terminal domain is sufficient for binding to metal ions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>These data are consistent with our model of Fur having a C-terminal metal-binding domain since all of the cysteines are located in this region of the protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>This study has revealed that , upon metal-binding , Fur undergoes a structural transition in which the N-terminal part of the protein becomes protease sensitive .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>The acceleration of Fur proteolysis in the presence of metal is analogous to the behavior of the E. coli CRP protein : cyclic-AMP-binding to the N-terminal domain of CRP induces protease sensitivity in the C-terminal DNA-binding domain ( Heyduk & Lee , 1989 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>The structure of P. aureaginose Fur is 40 % helical and 18 % β-sheet , encompassing an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and C-terminal dimerisation domain [ 18 : pdb entry 1MZB ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16814929" target="_blank">16814929</a>]<br></li>
<li>Metal binding results in enhanced cleavage of the N-terminal region of Fur by trypsin and chymotrypsin .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>The loss of eight or nine amino acids from the N-terminus of Fur thus results in a loss of 2-3 orders of magnitude in DNA-binding affinity and a considerable reduction in binding specificity , indicating that the N-terminal region of Fur is important for the interaction of this protein with DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the assay , performed with highly purified Fur protein , DNA , and HinfI restriction enzyme ( which may contain unknown contaminants from Haemophilus influenzae ) , revealed Fur activity , it follows that the Fur protein probably requires only certain divalent metals , and no additional cofactors , for its site-specific DNA-binding activity .

<li>A comparison of the activitiesof Cd ( I1 ) and Mn ( I1 ) with Fur also shows that metal-binding affinity and the ability of a metal to promote DNA-binding are not related .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1868094" target="_blank">1868094</a>]<br></li>

<li>Within the first 10 min of Zn addition , it appears that Fur senses extra iron ( from unknown sources ) , reflected in an increase in DNA-binding activity ( Fig. 5d ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22016571" target="_blank">22016571</a>]<br></li>

<li>For example , hydroxyl radical footprinting of the iucA promoter showed a phased pattern of protection throughout the FBS , with contacts occurring on opposite faces of the DNA helix , suggesting that Fur wraps around the DNA to make these contacts .10,16 In contrast , other studies have shown that Fur is too rigid to wrap around DNA .12 The overlapping dimer binding model assembles both of these seemingly contradictory pieces of data .

<li>The extent of the cir operator defined by footprint analysis ( 43 to 48 bp ) suggests that binding of two repressor dimers occurs if Fur conforms to the structural motif observed for most procaryotic repressors , in which each dimer contacts successive major groove turns on the DNA helix , thereby protecting about 20 bp for each dimer bound ( 25 , 27 ) .

<li>They are involved in processes as diverse as respiration , gene regulation , cofactor-biosynthesis , and DNA-RNA-metabolism .7 There is tremendous interest in understanding the mechanisms of Fe-S cluster biosynthesis , one reason being that several human diseases , including Friedreich 's ataxia , are the result of genetic defects in the protein machinery that makes Fe-S clusters .7 10.1021 / pr100920r 2010 American Chemical Society 6740 Journal of Proteome Research 2010 , 9 , 6740 -- 6751 Published on Web 10/11/201 The SUF system of E. coli is comprised of complex protein machinery , which , under the control of OxyR , IHF , IscR , andFur , synthesizes Fe S clusters during the potentially cytotoxic conditions of iron limitation and oxidative stress.6,11-14 ,17,18 The SUF system is encoded by the sufABCDSE operon .14 SufS is a cysteine desulfurase that mobilizes inorganic sulfur via a pyridoxal-5 ′ - phosphate cofactor and a conserved cysteine ( C ) residue and transfers the sulfur atom through a proposed persulﬁde transfer mechanism to the conserved C51 residue on the sulfur acceptor protein SufE.19-21 SufB , SufC , and SufD form a complex ( SufBC2D , hereafter referred to as SufBCD ) 22 that stimulates this cysteine desulfurase activity through an unknown mechanism ,21 though SufC is known to be an atypical ABC transporter ATPase .12 In vitro evidence suggests that SufE transfers the sulfur atom to SufB within the SufBCD complex and that SufBCD acts as a scaffold upon which an Fe-S cluster is assembled.22-24 It is not known whether the persulﬁde sulfur on SufE is liberated via nucleophilic attack by the recipient Cys thiol on the terminal sulfur of the persulﬁde , which would result in persulﬁde transfer , or via nucleophilic attack on the bridging sulfur , which would produce a disulﬁde-linked complex between SufE and the recipient protein and liberate sulﬁde that may then bind a free Cys residue for use in assembling an Fe-S cluster .5 It also remains to be determined whether the assembled cluster on SufBCD is transferred to a target apoprotein directly or via SufA.22,25-27 It is possible that SufE transfers sulfur to proteins other than SufB , as both the iron source and the means by which the sulfur on SufE is incorporated into an Fe-S cluster remain unknown .

<li>Yet , ﬁnally , mutation of both the MntR and Fur proteins also abolishes Mn2 repression ( Fig. 4F ) , which implies that Fur is the only other trans-acting factor involved .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029030" target="_blank">12029030</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is unexpected because , to our knowledge , almost every gene involved in siderophore-biosynthesis and export is known to be regulated at the promoter level by Fur ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20696910" target="_blank">20696910</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , at low Fe concentrations , Fur becomes inactive , which relieves the repression of genes involved in the biosynthesis , export , and import of siderophores .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20696910" target="_blank">20696910</a>]<br></li>

<li>While Fur regulates the amount of incoming iron , RyhB aids degradation of certain transcripts to direct available iron away from non-essential uses ( such as iron storage or incorporation into non-essential proteins ) in low-iron conditions , thus ensuring that the limited amount of iron is put to the most beneficial use ( Massé et al. , 2005 ) .

<li>The functions of the identified proteins are diverse : CysK and Mdh are part of the central metabolism , OmpA is a porin ( therefore involved in the response of the cell to environmental modifications ) , and Crl and Fur are regulators of gene-expression .

<li>Hence , we hypothesize that iron-respon-sive decoding of uof-fur , and by inference that of other genes ( see Supplementary Figure S4 ) , serves in addition to RyhB as a back-up mechanism to downregulate the synthesis of Fur and other non-essential iron-containing proteins during iron limitation ( Figure 7 ) .

<li>Although there was no previous research suggesting a thermoregulatory role for Fur , we investigate whether Fur might have a dual regulatory role in sensing both iron concentration and temperature to control fes and cirA transcription .

<li>DISCUSSION In addition to its role in iron acquisition , Fur is postulated to regulate general metabolic-processes as well as adaptation to acid stress ( 24 , 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852058" target="_blank">9852058</a>]<br></li>
<li>A wide variety of genes involved in various mechanisms such as oxidative and acid stresses are under Fur control .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>All genes involved in iron acquisition are Fur regulated ( 5 ) , along with many other genes , for which the reasons for iron regulation are more or less obvious , including regulators of general metabolism , pathogenicity genes , and genes for defense against oxidative and acid stresses ( 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>Other genes involved in general metabolism , pathogenicity , and defense against oxidative and acid stresses are also regulated by Fur ( 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>Later it was found out that Fur in addition regulated genes of the oxidative stress response , iron metabolism , and virulence determinants from pathogenic bacteria ( Hantke and Braun , 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11931550" target="_blank">11931550</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , besides its regulatory role in iron metabolism , Fur also mediates the response to acidic and oxidative stress ( for a review , see Hantke , 2001 ) , and is important for the regulation of the acidic tolerance response in Salmonella typhimu-rium , even though the respective genes are not regulated by iron ( Hall and Foster , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14617150" target="_blank">14617150</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur links iron metabolism and the regulation of oxidative stress defenses .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12475930" target="_blank">12475930</a>]<br></li>
<li>One target gene , identiﬁed using this approach and experimentally conﬁrmed to be regulated by OxyR , encodes the iron metab-olism regulator Fur , demonstrating coordinate regulation between oxidative stress response and iron metabolism ( 23 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11443092" target="_blank">11443092</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to sequence similarities , Zur is considered to be a member of the Fur family of metalloregulatory proteins , which include the Fur ( ferric iron uptake regulator ) proteins of E. coli and other bacteria involved in iron regulation ( 10 ) as well as PerR of B. subtilis , which controls the peroxide stress response ( 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10816566" target="_blank">10816566</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is clearly different than the iron regulation where Fur ( or DtxR in certain gram-positive bacteria ) acts as a global regulator of many genes related to iron uptake and the oxidative stress response ( Hantke & Braun 2000 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11831459" target="_blank">11831459</a>]<br></li>
<li>To this end , we can only speculate that the complexity of the Fur regulatory circuits demands post-transcriptional regulation to adjust the concentration of this global regulator not only for iron-homeostasis but also for its other tasks in cellular physiology .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14617150" target="_blank">14617150</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition the global regulator of iron-homeostasis , Fur , was also required to prevent induction of rcnA by iron , exemplifying how the control circuits of metal homeostasis systems overlap to gain speciﬁcity on regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17120142" target="_blank">17120142</a>]<br></li>
<li>As YtfE is an iron-containing protein and because of its putative involvement in iron metabolism , the possible control exerted by the global regulator of iron metabolism Fur was also analysed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16553864" target="_blank">16553864</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , given our previous ﬁndings that OxyR regulates the expression of the iron metabolism regulator Fur , possible OxyR regulation of a putative iron reductase was of interest .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11443092" target="_blank">11443092</a>]<br></li>
<li>A major new role for Fur in iron-homeostasis has been demonstrated in which Fur mediates the control of cellular iron-protein levels in response to iron availability .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our previous data suggested that YaaA helped to control the iron level during peroxide stress ; hence , we wanted to check whether YaaA worked with other proteins that also control iron-homeostasis during the OxyR response , including the iron uptake regulator ( Fur ) , iron-scavenging protein ( Dps ) , and manganese transporter ( MntH ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21378183" target="_blank">21378183</a>]<br></li>
<li>This Fe-dependent repression is mediated by a transcriptional repressor , Fur ( ferric up - take regulation ) , which also controls genes involved in other processes such as iron storage , the Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle , pathogenicity , and redox-stress resistance .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggested that not only RcnR but also Fur was involved in iron-dependent negative regulation of rcnA and that the presence of both RcnR and Fur led to repression of DrcnA : : lacZ in the presence of iron .

<li>Moreover , this approach also identiﬁed several indirect RyhB targets , suggesting that the small RNA RyhB plays a major role , along with the Fur protein , in the regulation of iron metabolism .

<li>Discussion Fur protein has long been recognized as a central regulator of iron metabolism in the cell , repressing various iron acquisition systems when iron is abundant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11917098" target="_blank">11917098</a>]<br></li>
<li>fhuF encodes a protein involved in acquiring iron from ferrioxamine and is known to be repressed by Fur ( 45 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is possible that there are trans-acting components in addition to the Fur protein involved in the regulation of iron-transport .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2823881" target="_blank">2823881</a>]<br></li>
<li>This regulation is accomplished by the general regulator of iron metabolism , the Fur protein , which acts as a repressor with iron as corepressor [ 5 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12781516" target="_blank">12781516</a>]<br></li>
<li>The simplest model for the regulation of iron-transport therefore places the Fur protein in the role of a classical repressor that binds iron as a corepressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2823881" target="_blank">2823881</a>]<br></li>
<li>The regulation of all iron-transport systems depends on the iron supply mediated by the Fur repressor protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2836368" target="_blank">2836368</a>]<br></li>
<li>`` Missing T '' assays revealed that the A and T resi-dues at positions 5 and 6 of the hexamer were the predominant Fur contact points , while the A and T residues at positions 2 and 3 played a minor role .15 Similar studies with the natural iucA Fur operator suggested that this arrangement of adjacent hexamers exists and is the functional Fur-binding sequence .16 Fur also regulates genes within the enterobactin system ,17 -- 20 the primary system for iron uptake in E. coli , involving the secretion of a catechol sidero-phore that chelates ferric ion with high afﬁnity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both in E. coli and in other genera , Fur appears to control not only siderophore production and iron-transport but also bacterial virulence determinants ( 19 ) for animal and plant tissues , thus suggesting a key role of this protein in survival and proliferation on the cells in a hostile environment .

<li>Our macroarray-based global analysis of iron - and Fur - dependent gene-expression in E. coli has revealed sev - eral novel Fur-repressed genes likely to specify at least three additional iron-transport pathways .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>This study provides additional evidence that the Fur gene product , in addition to its known regulatory effect on the expression of SOD and iron uptake mechanisms , also regulates HPI and HPII activity levels in E. coli .

<li>The ferric uptake regulator protein ( Fur ) controls the expression of genes involved in iron-transport ( 14 ) , but it is also involved in the response-to-oxidative-stress through the regulation of superoxide dismutase genes , which , as stated above , protect against ROS ( 4 ) .

<li>It is also interesting to note that the expression of gpmA ( encoding phosphoglycerate mutase in the glycolytic pathway ) and gltA ( encoding the TCA-cycle enzyme , citrate synthase ) is repressed by the Fe2 - Fur complex ( Table II ) , whereas acnA ( encoding the TCA-cycle enzyme aconitase A that converts citrate into isocitrate ) is known to be induced by Fe2 - Fur , suggesting that E. coli may respond to iron restriction by producing citrate to mediate iron uptake .

<li>Because Fur senses intracellular iron levels and adjusts gene-expression accordingly , it is assumed to be the master regulator of bacterial iron-homeostasis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16199566" target="_blank">16199566</a>]<br></li>

<li>A possible explanation may be that since the control of iron metabolism in E. coli is linked with the antioxidant response [ 26 ] , the absence of Fur may trigger constitutive expression of shock proteins that act as chaperones for the reconstruction of the tertiary structure of proteins observed in cells under oxidative stress [ 27 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16183297" target="_blank">16183297</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , expression analysis has demonstrated that the suf operon is controlled by OxyR and Fur , an H2O2-sensing regulator and an iron-dependent repressor , respectively , suggesting a stress response function for the SUF machinery under conditions of oxidative stress and iron limitation ( 36 , 37 ) .

<li>It was found that acnA resembles other citric-acid-cycle genes in being subject to CRP-mediated catabolite repression and ArcA-mediated anaerobic repression , and that it is positively regulated by the ferric uptake regulator ( Fur ) , which normally functions as a repressor , and by the oxidative stress regulatory system ( SoxRS ) .

<li>Recently , genomic studies have reported several genes that are up-regulated by Fur ; this complex regulation requires the Fur-dependent repression of ryhB , a small RNA that in conjunction with Hfq and RNaseE decreases the expression of several genes ( 42 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16418169" target="_blank">16418169</a>]<br></li>
<li>The transcriptional regulation of these genes requires several transcription factors ( including DnaA , IciA , FIS [ factor for inversion stimulation ] , Fnr , Fur , and NrdR ) , depending on the RNR class ; however , the factors that dictate the expression of some RNR genes in response to different environmental conditions are not known .

<li>When 100 nM Fur was present in the buffer with both labeled digestion products , the mobility of the 338-bp fragment ( nucleotides 188 to 525 [ Fig. 1 ] ) containing the iron control region ( as determined by the deletion analysis ) was retarded during electrophoresis , whereas the 187-bp fragment ( nucleotides 1 to 187 [ Fig. 1 ] ) consisting of upstream sequences was not ( Fig. 2B ) .

<li>The location of this region of Fur protection is at -105 to -65 on the sense strand and from -99 to -59 on the antisense strand with respect to the ftnA +1 site , and thus spans a surprisingly large 47 bp region upstream of the promoter .

<li>The question whether Fur might act by directly binding to the promoter sequences of the two sod genes was addressed by gel retardation assays ( 23 , 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>

<li>Because two Fur dimers can bind overlapping sites with 6-base separation ( 40,55 ) , we then multiply aligned the sequences by using window sizes ranging from ( 15 , þ15 ) to ( 5 , þ5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>
<li>The observation of two gpmA -- Fur complexes is consistent with the presence of two tandem and overlapping Fur boxes ( spanning 25 bp ) for gpmA allowing two Fur dimers to bind ( forming the g1 complex ) at low Fur concentration and three Fur dimers to bind ( forming the g2 complex ) at higher concentrations .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>
<li>Later , Lavrrar and McIntosh suggested that a 13-bp inverted-repeat ( 6-1-6 ) is the minimal unit recognized by a single Fur dimer , and that two overlapping ` 6-1-6 ' motifs correspond to the Fur box , which is required for high-afinity binding of Fur ( 55,58 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>
<li>Baichoo and Helmann reinterpreted the Fur box as two overlapping 7-1-7 inverted-repeats with a 6-bp spacing , and suggested that a 7-1-7 site , but not 6-1-6 , represents the minimal recognition unit of Fur ( 40 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>
<li>The model predicts that the 19-bp consensus Fur operator is conﬁg-ured as overlapping 13-mer sequences , and that two Fur dimers interact with these sequences from opposite faces of the helix .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12367523" target="_blank">12367523</a>]<br></li>
<li>Within the region of cir protected by Fur binding , two overlapping sequences can be identified ; these are both 68 % similar to the following 19-bp consensus sites which have been previously proposed to play a role in Fur recognition : GATAATGATAATCATTATC ( 12 ) and GAT ( A or T ) ATGAT ( A or T ) AT ( C or T ) ATTTTC ( 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2644221" target="_blank">2644221</a>]<br></li>
<li>Pohl et al. also proposed a two-dimer binding model , in which two Fur dimers bind two overlapping sites that are 5-bp apart ( 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17921503" target="_blank">17921503</a>]<br></li>

<li>Recently , a potential Fur binding site was identified in the untranslated 5 ' region of sodA ( Fig. 2 ; refs .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>Assuming that the iron box of sodA is the binding site of holo Fur , the affinity of Mn2 ' - Fur for the sodA promoter is significantly less than for the iucA promoter ; we believe this results from the different sequence of the sodA iron box and reflects nonoptimal solution conditions for Mn2 + - Fur binding to sodA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>The conditions we used in these experiments were optimized for binding Mn2 ' - Fur to the iucA operator ( 14 ) , which contains a typical iron box sequence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>The putative Fur binding site sequence ( Fur box ) is indicated in boldface letters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9171402" target="_blank">9171402</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Fur binding site , localized within 22 nucleotides of the mntH operator by in vivo operator titration assays , resembles the Fur-box consensus sequence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11466284" target="_blank">11466284</a>]<br></li>
<li>Another sequence that may bind the Fur repressor is predicted to overlap the fepB transcript initiation site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2536681" target="_blank">2536681</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since the various Crp and Fur binding sites differ in sequence , it is probable that cross-binding speciﬁcity will be site speciﬁc .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>A nucleotide sequence that strongly resembles the Fur repressor-binding site ( 6 ) is also present between + 1 and the predicted translational start codon at +55 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2536681" target="_blank">2536681</a>]<br></li>
<li>and so most likely represents an rxtension of the primary site rather that ) a distinct repressor binding sequence with lowered affinity for Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2139473" target="_blank">2139473</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , we propose the second sequence as the binding site of the Fur repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2836368" target="_blank">2836368</a>]<br></li>
<li>A potential promoter sequence was detected in the 5 ' noncoding region , but it was not associated with an `` iron box '' sequence ( i.e. , a binding site for the iron-dependent Fur repressor protein ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2661540" target="_blank">2661540</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , the dyad repeat sequence GAAAA TAATTCTTATTTCG is proposed to serve as the binding site of the Fur iron repressor protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2836368" target="_blank">2836368</a>]<br></li>
<li>This low match would explain the low-affinity Fur binding measured and the failure to identify by inspection any site strongly matching the Furbox consensus .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20015147" target="_blank">20015147</a>]<br></li>

<li>A sequence matching the consensus site for Fur binding in 11 of 19 bases was found to precede the promoter at position ® 61 relative to the transcription-start site ( Fig. 2c ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11101675" target="_blank">11101675</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consistent with a lack of direct regulation by Fur , we did not observe a consensus Fur binding site in the mntS promoter ( Fig. 1B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21908668" target="_blank">21908668</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the middle of the Fur binding site there is a region ( -92 to -74 ) that weakly matches the consensus Fur box ( Fur box II ; 12 matches out of 19 ) and is presumed to be primarily responsible for conferring the Fur-binding speciﬁcity ( Fig. 8B ) .

<li>Most notably , the cir sequence TGGATTGATAATTGTTATC , which contains the -35 region of P1 and much of the -10 region of P2 , was nearly 70 % homologous to a consensus Fur recognition site recently proposed ( 17 ) , GATAATGA TAATCATTATC .

<li>A few operons listed in Table 1 ( such as sdhC and fumA ) that appear to be subject to dual control by Crp and Fur are also known to be regulated by RyhB ( 24 , 45 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>

<li>Fur then should down-regulate ryhB ( not present in the microarray slides , since it is found inside the intergenic region between the yhhX and yhhY open reading frames ) , and those genes down-regu-lated by RyhB should then be induced .

<li>These Fur-re-pressed , Crp-activated genes are grouped into seven transcriptional units that have been shown to be regulated directly by Fur binding to their promoter regions ( fepA-entD , fes-entF-fepE , entCEBA-ybdB , ybiLXI , yncE , fecABCDE , and cirA ) .

<li>The iucC and fhuA genes were repressed by Fur ( Fig. 10D ) , catalase G activity was reduced 5-fold ( Fig. 10E ) , and protoporphyrin IX accumulated to levels similar to those of cells overproducing MntS ( Figs 8 and 10F ) .

<li>Further studies with acn-lac2 gene fusions and a wider range of transcription regulators indicated that acnA expression is initiated by G ~ ~ from PIacnAa , nd from PZacnA it is activated directly or indirectly by CRP , FruR , Fur and SoxRS , and repressed by ArcA and FNR .

<li>However , the three other possible consequences of the loss of these two transcription factors in a wild-type background indicate that gene expression can be activated and repressed , activated and activated , or repressed and repressed by Fur and Crp , respectively .

<li>Both Fur repression and Crp stimulation of transcription caused modest changes in fur gene expression during exponential growth ( 2-fold ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15659676" target="_blank">15659676</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the sodB gene , encoding superoxide dismutase , and the aceBAK operon , encoding the glyoxalate shunt enzymes , show the opposite responses , being activated by the loss of Crp and repressed by the loss of Fur .

<li>It was found that acnA resembles other citric acid cycle genes in being subject to CRP-mediated catabolite repression and ArcA-mediated anaerobic repression , and that it is positively regulated by the ferric uptake regulator ( Fur ) , which normally functions as a repressor , and by the oxidative stress regulatory system ( SoxRS ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8000525" target="_blank">8000525</a>]<br></li>
<li>In light of the absence of data suggesting a role for Fur as a positive effector , the activation of the yhhY promoter under conditions when Fur is also active could be explained by participation of another repressor , which in its turn is negatively regulated by Fur , in the regulation of yhhY .

<li>In addition to bfr , fhuABCD , and sdhCDAB , there are several other known Fe2 - Fur regulated genes ( acnA , flbB , fumA , fumB , fumC , purR , nohB , sodA , ygaC , and yhhX ) that were not affected by dip and Fur in this study .

<li>We ﬁrst veriﬁed this observation by determining the steady-state levels of fur mRNA in an E. coli ryhB strain and in the parental strain upon addition of the iron chelator 2,20-dipyr-idyl ( dip ) , which is known to induce ryhB transcription by alleviating the negative control of Fur ( Massé and Gottesman , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>As a consequence , transcription of fur mRNA leads to a certain level of metallo-Fur synthesis , which among many other genes represses ryhB transcription ( Massé and Gottesman , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>This interaction was corroborated by the co-puri-fication of Fur with His6-Crl and the activation of fur transcription by Crl and Fur observed in - galactosidase assays .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>

<li>However , because Fur autoregulates its own transcription , Crl might act by interaction with Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whereas the effect on Fur and FNR caused transcription alterations in the genes under their control , that of SoxR was unexpected ; although a large increase upon the transcription of soxS occurred , a corresponding increase on the SoxRS regulon could not be detected .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15546870" target="_blank">15546870</a>]<br></li>
<li>The relationship is further strengthened by showing that the genes ( f u m c and acnA ) encoding the minor aerobic enzymes are alone activated by SoxRS and a38.However , it breaks down with respect to Fur , which activates the minor aconitase gene ( a c n A ) but not the minor fumarase gene ( fumC ) except by readthrough transcription from its primary activation target , the gene encoding the major fumarase ( fumA ) .

<li>Finally , the fumA gene , encoding fumarase , shows strong apparent activation by both Crp and Fur , but the loss of both of these transcription factors together , as for the sdh and suc operons , gave a much less than additive effect .

<li>Studies performed by Massé and Gottesman ( 2002 ) showed that Fur positively regulates sodB expression by preventing transcription of the small RNA RyhB , which in turn negatively affects the stability of sodB mRNA .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because MnSOD activity was greatly enhanced by pQ2 + in Fur - cells and because MnSOD was not present at significant levels in Fur - cells grown under anaerobic conditions ( Fig. 1 ) , it is likely that the fur locus is not the major controlling factor of the cell of sodA expression ; by contrast , fur must be regulating sodB expression in a very robust manner .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , gene induction by metallo-Fur has remained puzzling until Massé Hernandez et al , 2006 ) , and E. coli fur expression is known to be moderately auto-regulated ( De Lorenzo et al , 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17268550" target="_blank">17268550</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because the level of expression of the sodB ' - ` IacZ gene on pDM28 was only slightly depressed in SodB - strains , sodB is probably not significantly autoregulated ; moreover , this fusion gene was only modestly regulated by fur ( Fur + / Fur - ratio , -3 to 5 ) ( Fig. 3 ) .

<li>Expression of the chromosomal fusion gene 4 ( sodA ' - ` lacZ ) as a function of in growth isogenic Fur ' and Fur - strains of E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , under anaerobic conditions , the simultaneous inactivation of fur and arcA/B genes resulted in expression of sodA-lacZ , which is in agreement with the conclusion that ArcA/B and Fur are negative regulators ( i.e. , repressors ) of the sodA gene ( 18 , 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , for maximum aerobic expression of the sodA gene both ArcA and Fnr must be present , while Fur must be absent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , regulation of the sodA gene by Fur , ArcA/B , and Fnr is independent of SoxRS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regulatory roles of Fnr , Fur , and Arc in expression of manganese-containing superoxide dismutase in Escherichia coli ABSTRACT Transcriptional regulation of the sodA gene , encoding the manganese superoxide dismutase ( superoxide : superoxide oxidoreductase , EC 1.15.1.1 ) of Escherchia coli , was studied by monitoring expression of sodA-lacZ in different genetic backgrounds and under different growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1565612" target="_blank">1565612</a>]<br></li>
<li>Summary Manganese superoxide dismutase ( the sodA gene product ) in Escherichia coli , is negatively regulated by two global regulators , ArcA ( aerobic respiration control ) and Fur ( ferric uptake regulation ) , coupling its expression to aerobic metabolism and the intracellular iron pool .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412671" target="_blank">8412671</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like repression of tonB under aerobic conditions ( Postle , 1990a ) , Fur was necessary for the increased repression of tonB expression under anaerobic conditions , but , as will be discussed later , it was by itself not sufficient .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , deletion of ryhB in the wild-type strain does not significantly increase its resistance to wrwycr , thus the altered expression of ryhB due to its reduced repression by Fur in the iron-limited conditions following wrwycr treatment is not the sole cause of the sensitivity of the wild-type strain to wrwycr .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22096151" target="_blank">22096151</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , the hmp-lacZ expression seems not to be inXu-enced by Fur in the absence and presence of PQ and is only slightly repressed by Fur in the presence of SNP in E. coli and Salmonella ( Figs. 2b , d ; 3a , c ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17024490" target="_blank">17024490</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under such conditions sodA transcription is partially repressed by Fur , and Sod enzyme is mainly produced from the sodB locus .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20075074" target="_blank">20075074</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under these conditions , holo Fur diminishes approximately fivefold the extent to which pQ2 + can induce sodA expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2180912" target="_blank">2180912</a>]<br></li>
<li>In our experimental conditions , growth at 30 ° C on LB plates , both Crl and Fur activated the expression of fur and repressed the expression of crl .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17224606" target="_blank">17224606</a>]<br></li>

<li>NsrR ( nitrite sensitive repressor ) , Fur ( ferric uptake regulation ) , and Fnr ( controls genes for the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth ) repress expression of hmp .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23824318" target="_blank">23824318</a>]<br></li>
<li>The transcriptional regulation of these genes requires several transcription factors ( including DnaA , IciA , FIS [ factor for inversion stimulation ] , Fnr , Fur , and NrdR ) , depending on the RNR class ; however , the factors that dictate the expression of some RNR genes in response to different environmental conditions are not known .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23873909" target="_blank">23873909</a>]<br></li>
<li>We also show that the loss of Crp and Fur regulates expression of the genes encoding the oxidative stress enzyme , superoxide dismutase , and the aceBAK operon encoding the glyoxalate shunt enzymes ( class B genes ) in directions opposite to those observed for the iron transport genes .

<li>The Fe2 - Fur induced genes listed in Table II are not essential and the observed reductions in their expression during aerobic growth would not be expected to lead to a major growth defect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>At ﬁrst glance , this is surprising , since Mn-loaded Fur can repress expression of at least some Fur-regulated genes ( 22 , 26 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21908668" target="_blank">21908668</a>]<br></li>

<li>Similar phenomena were observed in the s - driven promoters of sulA , uvrA , recA , fecI , entC and lacZ , 70 70 the transcription of which is directly controlled by a repressor protein ( LexA , Fur and LacI ) , but not in promoters of the housekeeping genes ftsA and ftsY , or in s - driven treA promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21396442" target="_blank">21396442</a>]<br></li>
<li>The common denominator of these promoters is that they are all negatively regulated by a repressor protein : lacZ is controlled by LacI that dissociates from the lac operator upon its interaction with lactose ( Reznikoff , 1992 ) ; SOS promoters are controlled by LexA , which is self-cleaved upon interaction with RecA single-strand DNA ﬁlament ( Butala et al. , 2009 ) ; iron acquisition genes are repressed by Fur when it is bound to Fe , and are derepressed þ2 when iron is scarce ( Brickman et al. , 1990 ; Braun et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21396442" target="_blank">21396442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur , an ironresponsive transcriptional regulator , plays a key role in this regulation in E. coli by repressing transcription of genes encoding iron-uptake proteins in the presence of sufficient iron ( Bagg & Neilands , 1987 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22096151" target="_blank">22096151</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fe2 - Fur represses transcription by binding to a 19-bp sequence , designated the `` iron box , '' normally located near the Pribnow box of cognate promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>
<li>The presence of a Fur box upstream from fepB indicated that fepB transcription was controlled in part by the amount of available iron .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2529253" target="_blank">2529253</a>]<br></li>
<li>When iron is abundant , Fe2 + - metallated Fur protein binds the promoter region of mntH and represses its transcription ( Kehres et al. , 2000b , Patzer & Hantke , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19400769" target="_blank">19400769</a>]<br></li>
<li>The regulation of iron uptake is under negative control by the Fur protein , which , in the presence of its co-represssor Fe2 + , represses the transcription of all genes involved in iron metabolism ; Fur -- Fe2 + also represses the expression of the small RNA RyhB ( Masse et al. , 2002 ; Masse and Gottesman , 2002 ) , a translational repressor of genes coding for a number of iron-containing and iron storage proteins ( Geissmann and Touati , 2004 ) .

<li>The expression of sufS -- and sufD -- lacZ fusions also were found to be regulated by Fur , a metalloregulatory protein that controls transcription of genes involved in iron metab-olism ( Patzer and Hantke , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15101990" target="_blank">15101990</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this context expression of both sod genes is under control of the Fur protein , which in the presence of sufficient iron represses the transcription of genes involved in iron assimilation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20075074" target="_blank">20075074</a>]<br></li>
<li>When associated with ferrous iron in vivo , the 17-kDa Fur protein ( 31 ) represses expression of the iron acquisition systems by inhibiting transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8021177" target="_blank">8021177</a>]<br></li>
<li>Increased transcription of known transcriptional factors such as Fur may indicate on one side that genes involved in iron uptake are highly repressed ; accordingly , two of the most Fur-negatively regulated genes , gltA and the operon including sufA , sufB , and sufS , are highly repressed ( 30 ) ( supplemental Table III ; see `` Discussion '' ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16418169" target="_blank">16418169</a>]<br></li>
<li>fecI and fecR cotranscription is inhibited by the iron-loaded Fur rep-ressor , which then results in a low level of transcription of the fec transport genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8602163" target="_blank">8602163</a>]<br></li>
<li>We found that FecI is essential for transcription of fec transport genes , and that fecI itself is not regulated by FecI , but is regulated by iron via Fe 2 + - Fur .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8602163" target="_blank">8602163</a>]<br></li>
<li>When iron is replete , the activated Fur binds to the promoter region ( Fur box ) of regulated genes and represses the transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17542919" target="_blank">17542919</a>]<br></li>
<li>Many iron-dependent genes are regulated by Fur ( ferric uptake regulator ) , which , in the presence of iron , represses the transcription of iron-responsive genes ( 25 , 63 , 80 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15489429" target="_blank">15489429</a>]<br></li>
<li>High Afﬁnity Zinc Uptake During our studies on iron and Fur regulated genes lacZ operon fusions were isolated that were derepressed under iron repletion and repressed under iron depletion .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11931550" target="_blank">11931550</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since members of the Fur modulon are regulated by iron and Fur in conjunction , only those genes that were 2-fold regulated by both dip and the fur mutation are considered further here .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12746439" target="_blank">12746439</a>]<br></li>

<li>Transcription of fecIR is repressed by iron and the Fur protein but is unaffected by ferric citrate , while fecABCDE transcription is regulated by iron and Fur and by ferric citrate via FecI and FecR ( 3 , 12 ) .

<li>The fumB gene is positively regulated by FNR , ArcA , Crp and Fur and negatively by Fis and NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22513097" target="_blank">22513097</a>]<br></li>
<li>The gene iha encoding adhesin in Y.pestis and E.coli O157 : H7 is likely to be Fur regulated as it has upstream FUR-boxes in both genomes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11812853" target="_blank">11812853</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur did not bind to the potential FBS which was centrally located at position - ( -26 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022270" target="_blank">8022270</a>]<br></li>
<li>In 1990 , it was suggested that FeSOD synthesis is positively controlled by Fur ( 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850997" target="_blank">10850997</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fur is induced 25.6-fold by high levels of c-di-GMP , probably through the SoxRS system , since soxS and soxR are induced 4.5 - and 1.74-fold , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16418169" target="_blank">16418169</a>]<br></li>
<li>As to the well-established inductive effect of pQ2 + , Fur ' and Fur - cells , containing sodA ' - ` IacZ and growing in the same conditions and at the same rates ( Fig. 2 ) , were similarly induced for , B-galactosi-dase in the presence of 20 puM pQ2 + .
