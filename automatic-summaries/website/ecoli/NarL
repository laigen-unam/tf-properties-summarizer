RABIN ' AND VALLEY STEWART1 ,2 * Sections of Microbiology ' * and Genetics and Development , 2 Cornell University , Ithaca , New York 14853-8101 Received 26 January 1993/Accepted 17 March 1993 Two sensor proteins , NarX and NarQ , mediate nitrate regulation of anaerobic respiratory gene expression .

<li>Our results demonstrate that , by using multicopy plasmids in a triple narQ narX narL deletion strain , we can distinguish between narQ and narX mutants that are unable to activate or inactivate NarL ( i.e. , kinase minus and phosphatase minus ) from those that are unable to activate but can inactivate NarL ( i.e. , kinase minus but phosphatase plus ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>To investigate the function of these two targets , derivatives of the ogt100 fragment , ogt102 and ogt104 , were constructed in which the NarL I or NarL II sites respectively were inactivated by mutations ( shown in Figure 4A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>To investigate whether IHF bound to the IHF II and IHF III sites inﬂuences this competition , we examined the binding of puriﬁed IHF and NarL to the pnrf53 fragment by using DNase I footprinting .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16936015" target="_blank">16936015</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , IH bound to the IHF II and IHF III sites does not interfere with the ability of NarL to-bind DNA and displace IHF from IHF I. To test how IHF III inﬂuences nitrite induction at pnrf , the promoter activities of pnrf53 , pnrf53 / 87 , and a pnrf53 fragment carrying the p124Gp123C substitution were measured in the narL narP strain JCB387 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16936015" target="_blank">16936015</a>]<br></li>
<li>UhpA differs from NarL in that phosphoryl-ation of UhpA is not required for its ability to-bind DNA and activate transcription ( Dahl et al. , 1997 ; J. Li et al. , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10512697" target="_blank">10512697</a>]<br></li>
<li>This behavior is clearly different from that of the close homol-ogue , NarL , whose ability to-bind to speci ® c sites DNA and to regulate its target promoters requires its phosphorylation ( J. Li et al. , 1994 ; Walker & DeMoss , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10512697" target="_blank">10512697</a>]<br></li>
<li>This intergenic region contains sites for NarL , IHF and Fnr ( Spiro and Guest , 1990 ; Walker and DeMoss , 1991 ; Dong et al. , 1992 ; Rabin et al. , 1992 ; Schroder et al. , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10564515" target="_blank">10564515</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nitrate induction of the narGHJl operon not only requires activated NarL , but also an accessory DNA binding protein , integration host factor , IHF ( Rabin et al. 1992 ; Schr6der et al. 1993 ) which has been shown to-bind to specific DNA recognition sites and mediates the formation of DNA bending ( Freundlich et al. 1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7747940" target="_blank">7747940</a>]<br></li>
<li>We concluded that , although NarL and IHF were unable to-bind together , the other ﬁve pairs of proteins could bind together to form ternary complexes ( Browning et al. , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>But the conformation of the phosphorylatable Asp59 residue itself in NarL is more like that of the Mg2 + - bound form of CheY than of apo-CheY ( Volz & Matsumura , 1991 ; Bellsolell et al. , 1994 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>Extensive similarity of N-terminal amino acid sequence of NarL to other prokaryotic regulatory proteins such as OmpR and PhoB ( Fig. 3 ) strongly suggests that NarL acts directly on the regulatory region of the narK and narC operons after some modification to an active form in the presence of nitrate .

<li>The carboxyl ` terminal domain of NarL shares only short patches of similarity with PhoB , OmpR , and SfrA , but it is strikingly similar to the analogous regions of DegU , UhpA , and FixJ ( Fig. 3 and Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2649492" target="_blank">2649492</a>]<br></li>
<li>The N-terminal two-thirds of the NarL protein has extensive homology with those of a diverse set of prokaryotic regulatory proteins , including OmpR , PhoB , SfrA , UhpA , CheY , CheB , NtrC , DctD , FixJ , VirG , SpoOF , and SpoOA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the most proteins of this family are subdivided into four different groups according to their C-terminal domain : ( i ) NarL , DegU , UvrC ORF2 , UhpA , and FixJ ; ( ii ) OmpR , PhoB , PhoM ORF2 , SfrA , and VirG ; ( iii ) NtrC , DctD , and PgtA ; and ( iv ) CheY and SpoOF .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the overall polypeptide chain fold in the phosphorylation region is conserved between NarL and CheY , several details of interactions in the active site differ , the most striking difference being the orientation of NarL side chains Asp13 and Asp14 relative to their equivalents in CheY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>One can even go one step further , and ask whether the displacement along helixes R1 between the two crystal forms might bear some relationship to conformations involved in the activation of NarL by phosphorylation .

<li>The third minor Fis -- NarL -- DNA complex , seen in Fig. 6B ( lanes 10 -- 13 ) , is likely NarL , FNR and Fis can bind to pnir together , but NarL interferes with the binding of IHF Fig. 5 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15225315" target="_blank">15225315</a>]<br></li>
<li>When both proteins were present ( Fig. 6C , lanes 8 -- 13 ) a distinct IHF -- NarL -- DNA complex was observed , indicating that NarL and IHF can bind to pnir together .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15225315" target="_blank">15225315</a>]<br></li>
<li>When both proteins were present , two new retarded bands , resulting from Fis -- NarL -- DNA complexes , were formed ( Fig. 6B , lanes 8 -- 10 ) , indicating that NarL can bind to pnir when the Fis I and Fis III sites are occupied .

<li>To determine whether NarL - and NikR-dependent regulation of Pnik expression were independent , LacZ levels were measured in nikR-deﬁcient and nikR narLX-deﬁcient strains containing wild-type NikR or a mutant protein , the Cys95Ala protein , which lacks high-afﬁnity nickel-binding activity and shows no DNA binding in vitro with up to 1 M NiCl2 ( 7 ) .

<li>The query here is whether , in the light of footprinting studies such as in Figure 3 , NarL could be said to-bind to DNA ( a ) as a homodimer , leading to adjacent antiparallel or inverted DNA-binding sites ; ( b ) as a linear array of monomers , leading to adjacent parallel or tandem binding sites ; or ( c ) as isolated monomers , leading to scattered binding sites of no fixed relationship .

<li>DNase I footprinting analyses involving NarL and the same 286-bp BssHII-BamHI moe promoter DNA as used for ArcA experiments were performed essentially as mentioned above with changes only in the binding conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL binding to DNA could conceivably initiate at one or more of the heptamer sites , and adjacent sites are then occupied as higher levels of NarL phosphate are formed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Unfortunately , we can not prove this point since , to our knowledge , no one , as yet , has reported NarL binding to DNA targets in vitro and our efforts to date have been abortive .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>Perhaps the bending of the DNA by IHF can enhance the binding of Fnr to the DNA or a putative interaction of Fnr with NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7651128" target="_blank">7651128</a>]<br></li>
<li>At the narG promoter , NarL binds far upstream of the transcription start and requires integration host factor , which probably bends the intervening DNA and helps NarL ` reach ' downstream : there is some evidence that NarL can directly contact RNA polymerase , since NarL-dependent activation can be detected in an fnr mutant ( Walker and DeMoss , 1991 ; Rabin ef ai , 1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>The c/s-acting sequence required for transcription activation by NarL is located approximately 150bp further upstream from the Fnr box ( Li and DeMoss , 1988 ) and interaction with NarL appears to activate transcription by a mechanism which can operate in the absence of Fnr ( Bonnefoy et ai , 1986 : Walker an Received 13 July , 1992 ; revised 28 August , 1992 ; accepted 31 August , 1992 tOn leave from : Laboratoire de Chimie Bacterienne , CNRS , Marseille , France .

<li>Sequence conservation in the carboxyl-terminal activation module is found among numerous transcription activators , some of which ( NarL , DegU , FixJ , ComA , etc. ) are parts of two-component regulatory systems , whereas others ( LuxR , MalT , etc. ) are apparently regulated by direct ligand binding and not by protein phosphorylation ( Henikoff et aI .

<li>As shown by its high activity in the presence of an effective 235 region , the inactivity of the uhpT promoter in the absence of UhpA is the result of its weak 235 element and not the consequence of silencing activity , as proposed for the blocking by NarL of the silencing of the nir promoter by FIS ( factor for inversion stimulation ) and another protein ( 35 ) .

<li>The first six lines of Fig. 4 show that the 10-base sequences upstream and downstream of this position are strikingly similar to the 10-base sequences at pnarG and pnirB , suggesting that two NarL subunits might bind to an inverted repeat at the nirB and fdnGHI promoters , whilst , at pnarG , NarL binds to a direct repeat .

<li>It is likely that members of the NarL family bind to dyad targets , in contrast to the binding of OmpR family response-regulators to direct-repeat targets .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11976297" target="_blank">11976297</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , there is virtually no structural information on their phosphorylated counterparts , and only two structures of unphosphorylated multidomain response-regulators have been solved ( 2 , 3 , 5 ) , the transcriptional-regulator NarL and the methylesterase CheB , which regulates the adaptation phase of bacterial chemotaxis .

<li>Cells lacking both NarLX and functional NikR showed constant high levels of Pnik-lacZ , suggesting that NarL and NikR are sufﬁcient to account for the Pnik repression observed under the conditions tested here ( Fig. 3 ) .

<li>This group also includes operons such as hybO that are thought to be repressed by ArcA during anaerobic-growth , so the effects of NarL at these promoters might again be direct , indirect ( via the ubiquinol pool ) , or both .

<li>To determine whether the effects of FNR and NarL on hcp transcription are direct or indirect ( for example , due to inactivation of NsrR by nitrite or nitric oxide generated during anaerobic-growth ) , the hcp promoter fragment from pNF383 was incubated with different concentrations of puriﬁed FNR and NarL proteins .

<li>Mutations in the putative NarL-binding site at the nirB promoter decrease FNR-dependent anaerobic induction , suggesting that NarL acts as a helper to FNR during transcription activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>To monitor only FNR-dependent transcription activation , these anaerobic cultures were not supplemen-ted with nitrate , which is known to stimulate NarL binding to PnarG ( Stewart , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11115116" target="_blank">11115116</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , it appears that the role of NarL at PnarG is more direct , as transcription activation of PnarG can not be detected in vitro , unless FNR , IHF and NarL are all present ( E. C. Ziegelhoffer and P. J. Kiley , unpublished ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11115116" target="_blank">11115116</a>]<br></li>
<li>The molecular mechanism by which NarL , IHF and FNR function together to stimulate transcription activation at PnarG is not known .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11115116" target="_blank">11115116</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the consequence of NarL binding to pnir is to remodel the nucleoprotein complex such that FNR activates transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15225315" target="_blank">15225315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previously , we demonstrated that NarL activates FNR-dependent transcription at pnrf by displacing IHF bound to the IHF I site ( 3 , 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16936015" target="_blank">16936015</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our analysis shows that NarL heptamers - 5 0 and - 2 2 are essential for this repression : it is easy to imagine how occupation of these heptamers results in repression , as these sites flank the FNR-binding sequence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL binding to its target reverses IHF-dependent repression , but does not relieve Fisdependent repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , deletion of ModE - and IHF-binding sites ( lPM43 ) had no measurable effect on the nitrate-dependent repression of P1 , implying that NarL binding is independent of ModE .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9466267" target="_blank">9466267</a>]<br></li>
<li>Misplacing the NarL-binding site by one base pair stops induction and leads to NarL-dependent repression , presumably as the misplaced NarL interferes with FNR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>In other cases , NarL-dependent repression is 2 mediated by the binding of NarL to sites downstream of the Fnr-binding site ( reviewed in references 8 and 26 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>We previously proposed that different conformations of NarL might be involved in activation and repression ( 38 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2066339" target="_blank">2066339</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results conﬁrm that FNR and NarL , respectively , are responsible for activation and repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19251855" target="_blank">19251855</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , the repression of FNR-dependent activation by IHF can be reversed by NarL ( Fig. 2B , lanes 7 -- 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , NarL is unable to overcome the repression of FNR-dependent activation by Fis ( Fig. 2B , lanes 13 -- 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>We repeated the analysis , using equally stringent search criteria , for other global DNA-binding proteins ( LexA , Fur , FruR , FNR , CRP , NarL and Fis ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18515344" target="_blank">18515344</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , activation involving FNR , NarL and IHF is overridden by Fis when it binds to its target at position -15 and blocks access to the nrf promoter -10 element .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL counteracts repression by IHF but is unable to alter repression by Fis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>To investigate the mechanism by which NarL counteracts IHF - and Fis-mediated repression at pnir , we used gel retardation assays and DNase I footprinting to examine the binding of NarL , FNR , Fis and IHF .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15225315" target="_blank">15225315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our results show that open complex formation is completely dependent on FNR and is enhanced by NarL , but is repressed by IHF or Fis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Figure 2 illustrates such an experiment , in which the pnrf97 fragment was incubated with RNAP in the presence of puriﬁed Fis , IHF , FNR and NarL , as indicated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previously , using electromobility shift assays , we investigated the pairwise binding of FNR , NarL , Fis and IHF to the pnrf97 fragment .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL can bind simultaneously to pnir with FNR , Fis and IHF .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15225315" target="_blank">15225315</a>]<br></li>
<li>As these growth conditions promote maximal activity of PnarG as a result of the combined function of NarL , IHF and FNR , these results suggest that the Accepted 30 August , 2000 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11115116" target="_blank">11115116</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our results show that NarL and FNR bind to their targets independently , but NarL is unable to activate the nrf promoter in the absence of FNR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>RNAP binding and that , in the presence of NarL , a new highly retarded complex appears that , most likely , contains NarL , FNR , and RNAP bound together to the ynfE promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19251855" target="_blank">19251855</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , a study of the NarL regulon based on transcriptome ana-lysis [ 11 ] identiﬁed some genes that appeared to be activated by NarL without FNR , and a thorough genetic analysis of the yeaR-yoaG operon regulatory region by Valley Stewart and co-workers proved that NarL activates the yeaR promoter independently of FNR [ 12 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>The activities of these proteins are controlled in some manner by a small mol-ecule : FNR ( positive ) is inactivated by O2 , NarL ( negative ) is phosphorylated by NarX in the presence of NO3 , NikR ( negative ) is activated by Ni2 , and NikR function is inhibited by one or more formate-inducible hydrogenase assembly components .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16159764" target="_blank">16159764</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under these conditions , NarL is also partially activated , resulting in NarL phosphate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent genomic studies of the FNR and NarL regulons revealed that ynfEFGHI expression is also activated by FNR and repressed by NarL ( 4 , 8 ) , but the different promoter elements were not deﬁned experimentally .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19251855" target="_blank">19251855</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consequently , protection against damage by NO must also be activated by NarL , FNR or both .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22029434" target="_blank">22029434</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , this reduction in the requirement for FNR-AR1 and FNR-AR3 in the presence of NarL is not a general feature of all NarL - and FNR-activated promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11115116" target="_blank">11115116</a>]<br></li>
<li>aeg-46 .5 is regulated by NarL and possibly by FNR ; thus , the presence of sequences that may be responsible for NarL or FNR control were sought in the upstream sequences by using the search program Find , allowing some mismatches .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8432709" target="_blank">8432709</a>]<br></li>
<li>The contiguous fumB and dcuB genes are also in this group and were already known to be regulated by FNR , NarL , and ArcA ( 31 ) ; thus , at this promoter , regulation by NarL might be both direct and indirect ( via the ubiquinol pool and ArcA ) .

<li>The NarX protein is the histidine protein kinase and the NarL protein is the response-regulator in the transcriptional activation of the narGHJZ operon ( Schroder et al. , 1994 ; Walker & DeMoss , 1993 ; Williams & Stewart , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10206709" target="_blank">10206709</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarX protein , besides transferring the phosphate after auto-phosphorylation to the NarL protein , also serves as a phosphatase of NarL-P to modulate the level of narGHJ1 operon expression ( Schroder et al. , 1994 ; Walker & DeMoss , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10206709" target="_blank">10206709</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the NarX protein acts predominantly as a NarL-phosphate phosphatase , although some NarL kinase activity is also present .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Genetic analysis reveals that the NarX protein also plays a negative role in controlling NarL activity , probably through stimulating dephosphorylation of NarL-phosphate ( `` NarL-phosphate phosphatase activity '' ) in the absence of nitrate ( 8 , 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarX protein also negatively regulates the NarL protein by acting as a NarL-phosphate phosphatase in the absence of nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Another possible explanation for this negative result is that the TorR protein could be phosphorylated by two different protein histidine kinases , as is the case for the NarL protein , which can be phosphorylated either by NarX or by NarQ ( 34 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8083154" target="_blank">8083154</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is possible that the NarX protein activates the NarL protein through the similar mechanism .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>
<li>The puriﬁed NarX and NarQ proteins were recently demonstrated to possess different enzymatic abilities to phosphorylate and dephosphorylate the NarL protein ( 23 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the NarX/NarL system belongs to sensor/regulator systems widely observed in prokaryotic gene regulation responding to a variety of environmental stimuli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that NarL can be phosphorylated independently of NarQ-phosphate and NarX-phosphate by other substrates ( i.e. , acetyl phosphate ) if it is produced at elevated levels because of increased gene dosage .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>But phosphorylation of NarL by NarX is low , resulting in low NarL-P concentrations under these conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9230919" target="_blank">9230919</a>]<br></li>
<li>Perhaps the major function of NarX is to convert NarL to a repressor conformation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2649492" target="_blank">2649492</a>]<br></li>
<li>Perhaps NarX modulates the activity of NarL , or acts as an alternate regulatory element under some conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2832370" target="_blank">2832370</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activated NarX then interacts with the N-terminal region of NarL , resulting in an allosteric or covalent modification of NarL to an active form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarX-phosphate or NarQ-phosphate then phosphorylates NarL to give the active form that binds to DNA , NarL-phosphate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of AcP , however , the binding afﬁnity to the cognate promoters signiﬁcantly increased for EvgA , NarL , UhpA , and UvrY , but little enhancement was observed for NarP and RcsB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26010043" target="_blank">26010043</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of acetyl phosphate for in vitro phosphorylation of RRs , the promoter-binding afﬁnity was signiﬁcantly enhanced for EvgA , NarL , UhpA , and UvrY .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26010043" target="_blank">26010043</a>]<br></li>

<li>Construction of arabinose-inducible expression system of RRs The coding sequences of six species of NarL-family RR ( EvgA , NarL , NarP , RcsB , UhpA , and UvrY ) were PCR-ampliﬁed using 5 - proximal and 3 - proximal primers of 0 0 each open reading frame ( for the sequence , see Table S1 0 in Supporting Information ) .

<li>As an initial attempt to identify the stage 3 cross talk at the step of target promoter recognition by RR , we analyzed in this study the cross-recognition of target promoters by six NarL-family RRs , EvgA , NarL , NarP , RcsB , UhpA , and UvrY .

<li>Multifactor promoters Among the NarL-family RR-dependent promoters analyzed in this study , the ydeP promoter was found to be activated by ﬁve RRs , EvgA , NarL , NarP , RcsB , and UvrY ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26010043" target="_blank">26010043</a>]<br></li>
<li>Note that , in experiments such as this where fnr was present on a multi-copy plasmid , we consistently found higher expression during aerobic-growth than in experiments such as those in Tables 1-5 , where fnr was present in single copy ( K. L. Tyson , J. A. Cole and S. J. W. Busby , unpublished data ) In spite of the complicated differences between pnirand pnrf , it is remarkable that , in both cases , the sequence elements required for activation by NarP or NarL consist of an inverted pair of heptamers separated by two base pairs .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the frdA , dmsA , aspA , ansB , and hyb promoters were significantly repressed only by nitrate-activated NarL , the hycA and dcuB promoters were also repressed by nitrate-activated NarP , as predicted in Table 4 , part E. Eight of the 37 significantly repressed operons gave repression ratios greater than 4-fold ( Table 5 , amount of transcript in the narXL narP strain relative to that of the narXL strain ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast with the frdABCD , aspA and ansB operons that are repressed only by NarL , the dcuB-fumB operon was among 37 operons that are repressed by NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16417494" target="_blank">16417494</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the frdABCD , aspA and ansB operons were repressed only by NarL , the dcuB-fumB operon was strongly repressed by both NarL and NarP ( Figures 1A and 1B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16417494" target="_blank">16417494</a>]<br></li>
<li>Another example is the NarL / NarP - and FNR-stimulated expression of nirB and nrf genes , which are repressed by Fis and IHF ( Browning et al. , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15066032" target="_blank">15066032</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription control of acs -- yjcH -- actP is complex and the intergenic region between acs and nrfA is bound by CRP , FNR , IHF , FIS and NarL or NarP and is folded into an ordered nucleoprotein structure that permits the two divergent promoters to be regulated independently ( Browning et al. 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17273855" target="_blank">17273855</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , we propose that , although NarP and NarL bind as dimers , transcription activation requires activity in just one of the subunits of the dimer ( this has been shown for both CRP and FNR : Zhou etal .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , NarL and NarP protect FNR-dependent transcription at pnrf from both the negative and positive effects of IHF and appear to function like insulator proteins rather than conventional transcription activators , which stimulate promoter activity by recruitment of RNA polymerase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16936015" target="_blank">16936015</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL and NarP activate FNR-dependent transcription by counteracting the repressive effects of IHF and Fis ( Fig. 1B ) , and thus the role of IHF and Fis is to set the co-dependence of pnir on both FNR and NarL/NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15225315" target="_blank">15225315</a>]<br></li>
<li>It was suggested that FNR-dependent transcription activation at pnir is suppressed by these upstream-bound proteins , and that the role of NarL and NarP is simply to counteract this suppression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10972841" target="_blank">10972841</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , at pnir , Wu et al. ( 1998 ) found that FNR-dependent transcription activation is repressed by upstream-bound factors , and that NarL and NarP activate pnir by counteracting these repressing factors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10972841" target="_blank">10972841</a>]<br></li>
<li>Note that our observation that NarL can increase FNR-dependent open complex formation in the absence of IHF argues that it , and perhaps NarP , behave as genuine co-activators at the nrf promoter as well as anti-repressors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>In previous work ( 3 -- 6 ) , we showed that the DNA target for FNR at pnrf is centered at position 41.5 ( i.e. , between 41 and 42 bp upstream from the transcript start point ) , that anaerobically induced FNR-dependent activation of pnrf is downregulated by the binding of the nucleoid-associated protein IHF to a target ( IHF I ) centered at position 54 , and that this repression is relieved by the binding of either NarL or NarP to a DNA target centered at position 74.5 ( Fig. 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20472787" target="_blank">20472787</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , Fis protein is a major factor responsible for catabolite repression at the nrf promoter , and Fis can override activation by FNR and NarL or NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>The binding of NarL or NarP to the nir promoter displaces IHF and overrides the repression of FNR-dependent activation by IHF and Fis ( Browning et al. , 2004 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>In previous work , we found that NarL or NarP activates the nir promoter by binding to a site centred at position -69.5 and counteracting the repressive effects of IHF and Fis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15225315" target="_blank">15225315</a>]<br></li>
<li>The binding of NarL or NarP to the 7-2-7 element , centred at position -74.5 , displaces IHF and activates the promoter provided that Fis is not present ( see text ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>The binding of NarL or NarP to the 7-2-7 element , centred at position -69.5 , counteracts the effects of IHF and Fis , and activates the promoter provided that Cra is not present .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our observation that NarL could displace IHF from its site at the nrf promoter suggested that NarL/NarP activates transcription by counteracting IHF-mediated repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Once phosphorylated , NarL or NarP binds to the same target site centered at position 69.5 ( Fig. 1A ) and activates transcription by displacing IHF from IHF I , thereby counteracting the repression by IHF and Fis from upstream sites ( 3 , 25 , 28 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18757534" target="_blank">18757534</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , when repression by both Fis and IHF is disrupted , nitrite-triggered NarL or NarP is no longer required for optimal activation of pnir .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10972841" target="_blank">10972841</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nitrate repression of the hya operon was mediated by both NarL and NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>

<li>Thus , it is possible that NarL and NarP can displace IHF and that the consequence of this is to reposition pnir upstream sequences ( Fig. 8B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10972841" target="_blank">10972841</a>]<br></li>
<li>1 NarL and NarP counteract the negative effects of Fis and IHF but not H-NS Wu et al.

<li>A 20 nM concentration of supercoiled pVJS2111 plasmid DNA was preincubated in reaction buffer for 20 min with Fnr ( D154A ) , phosphorylated MBP-NarP , or phosphorylated MBP-NarL proteins in a total volume of 20 ml .

<li>The search for proteins with homology to the putative BglJ protein yielded other members of this family including FimZ , UvrC , MalT , RcsA , NarP , and NarL ( ALTSCHUL et al. 1990 ; STOUTet al. 1991 ; SWENSOaNnd CLEGG1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8725214" target="_blank">8725214</a>]<br></li>
<li>This indicates that phospho-NarL protein is sufﬁcient for normal ( yeaR-lacZ ) induction but that phospho-NarP protein also can contribute , at least in the absence of phosphoNarL protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17720788" target="_blank">17720788</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , phosphorylated NarP protein bound at the same heptamer sites at positions 109 and 100 competes with NarL to antagonize its ability to stimulate transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the phosphorylated MBP-NarP and MBP-NarL proteins were spun through a Sephadex G-25 column to remove acetyl phosphate , 20 to 40 % of the protein was lost .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>

<li>This results from its dependence on FNR that binds to a site at position -41.5 , and NarL or NarP that bind to a 7-2-7 element centred at position -69.5 ( Fig. 10 ; Jayaraman et al. , 1989 ; Tyson et al. , 1993 ) .

<li>Deletions and mutations in the nir promoter upstream sequences The simplest model to account for the results in Fig. 2 is to suppose that one or more factors other than NarL and NarP bind to DNA elements upstream of the NsiI site at the nir promoter and can up or downregulate Fnr-depen-dent transcription activation , according to their precise location .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>

<li>Phosphorylated NarL and NarP then bind to specific heptamer sequences at target promoters , and either up - or downregulate transcription initiation at these promoters ( for examples , see Tyson et al. , 1994 ; Darwin et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10972841" target="_blank">10972841</a>]<br></li>
<li>Prior DNA footprinting studies demonstrate that NarL and NarP bind to and protect several NarL heptamer recognition sites located in the nrfA promoter region ( 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon activation , NarL and NarP bind to identical heptamer sequences and , at many target promoters , two heptamers are found as a ` tail-to-tail ' inverted repeat ( often referred to as the 7-2-7 arrangement ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20533909" target="_blank">20533909</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarP regulon overlaps the NarL regulon because both NarL and NarP can bind to a NarP site , which is a 7-2-7 inverted repeat sequence where the seven conserved bases form the NarL heptamer [ 10 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16417494" target="_blank">16417494</a>]<br></li>
<li>The effects of point mutations suggest that NarL and NarP both bind to the same target , which is a pair of heptamer sequences organized as an inverted repeat , centred 69V ^ bp upstream of the transcript startpoint .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>We suggest that both NarL and NarP recognize the same heptamer sequence , but that there is a set of degenerate sequences that , though still recognized by NarL , are bound very poorly by NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , these results suggest that NarL and NarP bind to the same target sequences at the nir promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ratio column indicates the inhibition in Fnr-dependent activity in the absence of NarL and NarP : this inhibition is lifted by removal of the upstream sequences .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ratio column indicates the inhibition in Fnr-dependent activity in the absence of NarL and NarP caused by Fis protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , in the absence of NarL and NarP , Fis inhibits Fnr-dependent activation of the nir promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , deletions and various point mutations in the upstream sequences lead to an increase in Fnr-dependent nir promoter activity in the absence of NarL and NarP , reducing the co-dependence of the nir promoter on both Fnr and NarL/NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>
<li>As Fnr does not affect the expression of NarP or NarL and vice versa ( Darwin and Stewart , 1995 ; K. Tyson and A. Bell , unpublished results ) , the co-depen-dence of the nir promoter on Fnr and NarL/NarP is likely to be caused by some sort of direct or indirect interaction between Fnr and NarL/NarP bound at their cognate targets .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , at the nir operon promoter , our present results argue that the major role of NarL and NarP is to counteract proteins that are suppressing Fnr activity , and , although we can not prove the point conclusively , any direct activatory role is likely to be very minor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>
<li>We also reproduced the regulation of the napF promoter by Fnr , NarP , and NarL in vitro and conﬁrmed and extended our previous conclusions about napF operon regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>It will be interesting to investigate these points and to search for other cases in which NarL and NarP function by counteracting repressors , as at the nir operon promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of either phospho-MBP-NarP or phospho-MBP-NarL fusion proteins alone , there was a slight increase in napF transcription ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , in the presence of either phospho-MBP-NarP or phospho-MBP-NarL fusion proteins the transcript was slightly shorter than in their absence ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>These in vitro transcription experiments demonstrate that , in the presence of Fnr , the NarP protein causes efﬁcient transcription activation whereas the NarL protein does not .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>This may indicate that the napF transcription start site changes in the presence of MBP-NarP or MBP-NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>This prediction was tested in vitro by investigating the effect of increasing amounts of MBP-NarL on napF transcription in the presence of Fnr ( D154A ) and MBP-NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since MBP-NarL , either alone or in the presence of only Fnr ( D154A ) , does not decrease ( repress ) napF transcription ( Fig. 4 ) , we conclude that MBP-NarL antagonizes MBP-NarP-dependent activation , presumably by binding site competition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>It appeared that the in vitro napF transcription start site in the presence of either RNA polymerase alone or Fnr ( D154A ) was approximately three nucleotides upstream relative to the site in the presence of MBP-NarL or MBP-NarP ( Fig. 3 and 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regardless of the mechanism , the NarL protein is unable to activate the napF promoter when bound to the 244.5 site and can be thought of as a natural positive-control mutant ( relative to NarP function ) in this context .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>The inability of NarL to activate napF operon expression led us to hypothesize that NarL is deﬁcient in the mechanism by which NarP activates transcription from the 244.5 binding site ( 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>By contrast , both NarL and NarP are competent to activate transcription activation from the more upstream binding sites of other operon control regions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>This demonstrated that either NarL or NarP is required to activate transcription from the hcp promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15667305" target="_blank">15667305</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is possible that NarP and Fnr may activate napF transcription synergistically whereas Fnr and NarL can not , as discussed below .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phospho-NarL and - NarP activate transcription of the narG and napF operons , respectively , whereas phospho-NarL antagonizes napF operon transcription ( 18 , 22 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19060147" target="_blank">19060147</a>]<br></li>
<li>Unless NarP , when acting as a repressor , can also recognize and occupy individual heptamer sites , as has been demonstrated for NarL , this argues against competition between the repressors as being the explanation for the enhanced repression of hyb in a narP mutant background .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the results suggest that NarL and NarP proteins are competing with the main regulator factor of # rd , which is activated by nitrite ( or by a derivative product ) , and may bind to the nucleotide region in the vicinity of the putative narL/narP binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12586421" target="_blank">12586421</a>]<br></li>
<li>A plausible explanation for these observations is that mutation of the +6 or +15 heptamers inhibits phospho-NarP binding , allowing nitrite-activated phospho-NarL to-bind at the remaining unaltered heptamer ( either at the +6 heptamer , where NarL acts as an effective repressor , or at the +15 heptamer , where NarL does not contribute significantly to repression ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18227264" target="_blank">18227264</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , mutation of the 216 heptamer enhanced repression in the presence of nitrite , suggesting that NarL binding at 216 antagonizes NarP action at the 7-2-7 site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18227264" target="_blank">18227264</a>]<br></li>
<li>The enhanced repression observed in the presence of nitrite when the 216 heptamer was mutated suggests that the presence of NarL at the 216 site inhibits the action of NarP at the 7-2-7 site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18227264" target="_blank">18227264</a>]<br></li>
<li>Many questions raised in part by this structure remain unanswered , and must be the subject of future investigations : ( 1 ) How are NarL and NarP activated for binding to DNA by phosphorylation ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarP phosphate appears to be a mild antagonist of NarL phosphate binding to DNA when formate levels are low ( Fig. 3A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although phospho-NarL can also bind to heptamers that are deployed in other conﬁgurations ( 2 , 4 , 7 , 17 ) , we focus here on the 7-2-7 heptamer pairs that comprise the sole or principal NarL and NarP protein binding sites in their respective control regions ( Fig. 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12644479" target="_blank">12644479</a>]<br></li>
<li>This activation is solely dependent on the NarP protein , unlike all other operons studied , for which activation is dependent on NarL only or on either NarL or NarP ( 8 , 26 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>This competitive binding presumably leads to antagonization of NarP-dependent activation by the NarL protein , since only NarP and Fnr together cause maximum napF expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL binding to the site results in reduced napF expression relative to NarP binding , including a reduced contribution to activation by the Fnr protein ( related to CRP ) from its DNA site upstream of the NarP/NarL site ( 9 , 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19854903" target="_blank">19854903</a>]<br></li>
<li>The phospho-NarL protein antagonizes phospho-NarP-dependent transcription activation by competing for binding to the 7-2-7 heptamer pair ( 6 , 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12644479" target="_blank">12644479</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , by competing with NarP for the 244.5 binding site , NarL antagonizes NarP-dependent activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>This conﬁrms that the phospho-NarL and - NarP protein binding site , identiﬁed by sequence inspection , is critical for regulation by these proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17720788" target="_blank">17720788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Substitutions were designed to eliminate binding to the half-site sequence , to leave the promoter 35 element and the phospho-NarL and - NarP protein binding site intact , and to maintain the overall G C composition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17720788" target="_blank">17720788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Cells were grown anaerobically in ni-trate-free minimal medium in order to `` sample '' bound proteins in the absence of NarL or NarP binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20472787" target="_blank">20472787</a>]<br></li>
<li>This confirms that the NarP receiver inhibits binding , similar to NarL , and that NarP-CTD binds target sites in vitro as avidly as NarL-CTD .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20634237" target="_blank">20634237</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suppression is reversed by the binding of NarL or NarP at position 74.5 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16936015" target="_blank">16936015</a>]<br></li>
<li>The chemostat studies also revealed new roles for the NarL and NarP proteins in the activation and/or repression of the two operons in contrast to prior conclusions derived from batch culture studies .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>The resulting plasmids were then transformed into the Dlac narL narP strain , JCB3884 ( Table 1 ) , in order to monitor the effects of IHF in the absence of activation by NarL or NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15225315" target="_blank">15225315</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that low levels of phosphorylated NarP and NarL proteins may be present during growth in the absence of an inducer and are able to stimulate signiﬁcant levels of transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=13129959" target="_blank">13129959</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that the low levels of phospho-NarP ( and phos-pho-NarL ) are present even with no added inducer .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=13129959" target="_blank">13129959</a>]<br></li>
<li>Acetyl phosphate at 100 mM was 21 added for phosphorylation of His - NarL and His - NarP ; control 6 6 assays established that this concentration did not influence the EMSA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20634237" target="_blank">20634237</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , nine species of RR ( AtoC , CheY , CusR , HydG , KdpE , NarL , NarP , NtrC , and YfhA ) were phosphoryl-ated by non-cognate HKs besides their cognate HKs .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15522865" target="_blank">15522865</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , significant levels of the cross-talk in trans-phosphorylation were observed for a group of RRs ( NarP , CpxR , NarL , and HydG ) , which showed the low level of trans-phosphorylation by the cognate HKs .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15522865" target="_blank">15522865</a>]<br></li>
<li>These sites , which result in missense substitutions ( NarL , Lys-165 to Glu ; NarP , Lys-125 to Gly and His-163 to Glu ) , were designed for a separate study to analyse properties of NarL -- NarP chimerae .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20634237" target="_blank">20634237</a>]<br></li>
<li>The level of phosphorylated RRs was less than 1 % for CreB , HydG , YedW , NarL , CheB , OmpR , DcuR , CpxR , YehT , and NarP ( in decreasing order ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15522865" target="_blank">15522865</a>]<br></li>
<li>The role of this complex in repressing pnir , and its disruption by NarL and NarP , are discussed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10972841" target="_blank">10972841</a>]<br></li>
<li>The hyaA promoter has been reported to be repressed by both NarL and NarP ; the other operons in this group possibly share this pattern of regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>The napF operon control region is the one exception to these generali-zations about NarL - and NarP-dependent regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this case , either nitrite-triggered NarP or NarL were sufficient for activation , contrasting with pnir where nitrite-triggered NarP is not active .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL functions as the superior activator at high concentrations of nitrite , whereas NarP plays an activation role at low nitrite concentration .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26010043" target="_blank">26010043</a>]<br></li>
<li>This group includes well characterized promoters that are activated by NarL but not by NarP , such as narK and narG ( 7 , 23 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>( 3 ) How do NarL and NarP bind to DNA : as monomers , normal symmetric dimers , head-to-tail dimers , or even possibly heterodimers under some circumstances ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conciude that NarL and NarP bind to the same hepta-mer sequences , but that the affinities for the two factors vary from site to site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition NarL , but not NarP , can also bind to heptamers in other arrangements ( 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>, 1993 ) , the simplest explanation being that both NarL and NarP bind to the two NarL heptamers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both NarL and NarP bind to heptamers organized as inverted repeats with 2-bp spacing .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , these are good candidates in this group for repression by NarL but activation by NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>As observed in vivo , this activation by Fnr and NarP is antagonized by the addition of NarL in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , NarL and NarP operate differently at the napF promoter , where NarL blocks activation of NarP ( 30 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , our measurements reﬂect the ability of FNR to activate pnir without the aid of NarL or NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18757534" target="_blank">18757534</a>]<br></li>

<li>NarL controls the expression of many proteins involved in anaerobic respiration and , at most of its known promoter targets , it co-regulates transcription together with another global transcription factor , protein FNR , the ` master ' regulator of anaerobic adaptation [ 2,8 -- 10 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>FNR-independent expression is minimal , and the simplest explanation for the results is that NarL interacts with FNR : we suppose that the G85A change in FNR alters the conformation ol FNR to interfere with this interaction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>The interaction of FNR-AR1 and FNR-AR3 with RNAP is apparently altered by NarL and/or IHF Although some FNR-dependent promoters appear to use only FNR for transcription activation , other promoters , such as PnarG , require the additional factors NarL and IHF for maximal expression ( Rabin et al. , 1992 ; Stewart , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11115116" target="_blank">11115116</a>]<br></li>
<li>Maximal expression of PnarG occurs under anaerobic-growth conditions in the presence of nitrate and , in addition to FNR , requires the DNA-binding proteins NarL and IHF , which bind to DNA sequences located upstream of the FNR site ( Rabin et al. , 1992 ; Schroder et al. , 1993 ) ( Fig. 1B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11115116" target="_blank">11115116</a>]<br></li>
<li>70 In the presence of nitrate , PnarG shows reduced requirements for FNR-AR1 and AR3 To investigate the effect of the FNR-AR mutants on PnarG expression in the presence of NarL and IHF , b-galactosidase activity was assayed in strains grown anaerobically in the presence of 20 mM potassium nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11115116" target="_blank">11115116</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , in the presence of NarL and IHF , the requirements of FNR-AR1 and FNR-AR3 for PnarG expression appear to be less stringent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11115116" target="_blank">11115116</a>]<br></li>
<li>This operon was initially identiﬁed by Choe and Reznikoff as an anonymous anaerobically expressed gene at map coordinate 46.5 ( aeg-46 .5 locus ) , whose expression is activated by the Fnr protein and inhibited by the NarL protein ( 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=13129959" target="_blank">13129959</a>]<br></li>
<li>A difference in these models is that high levels of NarL-phosphate are postulated to repress aeg-93 ( ntf ) operon expression , while the NarL protein does not repress fdnG operon expression under any conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , non-phosphorylated NarL gave no DNase I protections in the dmsA promoter region under the same conditions for either strand ( up to 10 µM ) , suggesting that NarL-phosphate , but not NarL , can act as a transcriptional-repressor for dmsA expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12079504" target="_blank">12079504</a>]<br></li>
<li>These ﬁndings indicate that NarL phosphate , but not the inactive dephosphorylated form of NarL , binds at the fdhF promoter to suppress fdhF gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the mutants behave like the strain that contains only the narL1 plasmid , in which the constitutive activation of narG-lacZ expression is seen : this occurs because of the elevated level of active NarL that is formed independently of the NarX kinase activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>As expression from P1 is abolished in an fnr background , this increase is unlikely to be caused by further repression of P1 by NarL , suggesting that NarL may function as a weak positive regulator of expression from P2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9466267" target="_blank">9466267</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon activation , NarL binds DNA and modulates the expression of its target genes by the repression or activation of transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>To evaluate how the sites contribute to the activation versus the repression of nrfA gene expression at low , intermediate , and high levels of nitrate , single - and double-base-pair mutations were introduced into the NarL heptamer sites designated 222 , 250 , and 270 , ( Fig. 5 ) .

<li>Thus , the 250 NarL heptamer site appears to ﬁne-tune the activation and repression of nrfA gene expression by narrowing the window of maximal gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>

<li>A lower level of NarL in a modE mutant could account for the decrease in expression of the narGHJZ and narK operons .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10206709" target="_blank">10206709</a>]<br></li>

<li>, 1993 ) , On the basis of this , we proposed a consensus NarL-binding sequence , 5 ' - TACYNKT-3 ' , and this has been dubbed the ` NarL heptamer '' ( Stewart , 1993 ) , Interestingly , single mutations in either of the pnir NarL heptamers suppressed activation by nitrite but not nitrate , whilst mutation of both heptamers suppressed both nitrite and nitrate activation , A likely explanation for this is that nitrite-triggered NarL is phosphorylated to a lesser degree than nitrate-triggered NarL ( Rabin and Stewart , 1993 ) , Therefore , two high-affinity NarL-binding hepta-mers are required for activation by the limited quantities of active NarL generated in the presence of nitrite .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626281" target="_blank">8626281</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of nitrate , NarL activates transcription of operons involved in nitrate respiration , i.e. , the nitrate reductase operon ( encoded by narGHIJ ) and the formate dehydro-genase-N operon ( encoded by fdnGHI ) , and represses the synthesis of alternate respiratory enzymes like fumarate reductase ( encoded by the frdABCD operon ) ( 6 , 16 , 37 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8071220" target="_blank">8071220</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL activates transcription of some operons ( narGHJI , narK , and chiD ) and represses transcription of others ( frdABCD and pfl ) in response to nitrate ( 19 , 21 , 31 , 36 , 40 , 42 , 43 ) , providing an economical hypothesis for at least part of the coordinate regulation of anaerobic metabolism by nitrate ( 19 ; Fig. 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2649492" target="_blank">2649492</a>]<br></li>
<li>Another subfamily of RRs is represented by NarL , a transcription factor that both activates and represses genes involved in nitrate and nitrite metabolism ( 175 , 176 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10966457" target="_blank">10966457</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nitrate-dependent increase in β-galactosidase activity required molybdate as well as NarL protein since a modB or narL mutant ( strains AH47 and AH58 , respectively ) produced only about 800 -- 900 units of β-galactosi-dase activity both in the presence and absence of nitrate in LBG medium when grown anaerobically ( Table 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of the dmsABC genes that encode the membrane-associated DMSO/TMAO reductase is positively regulated during anaerobic conditions by the Fnr protein and negatively regulated by the NarL protein when nitrate is present .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12079504" target="_blank">12079504</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of the dmsABC and the frdABCD operons is repressed in the presence of nitrate , and this repression is dependent on the NarL protein ( 8 , 10 , 21 , 28 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recently , the preferential utilization of nitrate over the other anaerobic electron acceptors , such as fumarate , was found to be mediated by the NarL protein , which appears to act as a pleiotropic repressor on the frd operon in the presence of nitrate ( 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3301812" target="_blank">3301812</a>]<br></li>
<li>When E. coli is grown in the presence of nitrate , the activated NarL protein induces the narGHJI ( nitrate reductase ) operon but represses the dmsABC ( DMSO reductase ) and frd.ABCD ( fumarate reductase ) operons ( 10 , 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8083154" target="_blank">8083154</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of nitrate reductase A is activated by the phosphorylated NarL protein ( NarL-P ) during anaerobic-growth in the presence of nitrate [ 10,11 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10548535" target="_blank">10548535</a>]<br></li>
<li>Synthesis of these three respiratory enzymes is known to be negatively controlled by nitrate and the effect is probably mediated directly by the NarL protein ( Stewart , 1982 ; luchi and Lin , 1987 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2677602" target="_blank">2677602</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , NarX is predicted to be a transmembrane protein , which acts as a sensor for nitrate and transduces signal of nitrate availability to the narK and narC operons via NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon stimulation by nitrate , the sensor undergoes autophosphorylation and becomes a protein kinase for its cognate regulator , NarL ( 10 , 34 , 38 , 46 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8132465" target="_blank">8132465</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the NarL protein mediates the nitrate regulation of these operons .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>This nitrate induction is mediated by the activator protein NarL ( 11 , 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1528882" target="_blank">1528882</a>]<br></li>
<li>These studies suggest that the IHF protein performs a DNA bending function at the narG promoter to allow nitrate-dependent activation by the NarL regulatory protein , and second , it enhances the Fnr-dependent expression from the narG promoter under anaerobic cell growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8419352" target="_blank">8419352</a>]<br></li>
<li>A promoter proximal region is required for the induction by Fnr , and a region distal to the promoter is essential for the activation by NarL in the presence of nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3138237" target="_blank">3138237</a>]<br></li>
<li>Such a construction is regulated normally by aerobic and anaerobic conditions but is unaffected by the presence of nitrate or NarL and therefore provides an experimental system for studying the mechanism of Fnr-mediated transcription activation in the absence of regulation by other upstream activators The sequence requirements for Fnr-dependent transcription of the narGHJI operon of Escherichia coli were studied in plasmids carrying a narG : : / acZprotein fusion with the 5 ' end of the promoter deleted so that expression was controlled exclusively by Fnr .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2041473" target="_blank">2041473</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2160397" target="_blank">2160397</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , with the pMW61 derivative ( pMW617 ) aerobic expression was stimulated 20-fold by nitrate , confirming that the stimulation of transcription by NarL occurs in the absence of a functional Fnr box under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1735706" target="_blank">1735706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , they demonstrate that the stimulation of transcription by nitrate-activated NarL occurs under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1735706" target="_blank">1735706</a>]<br></li>
<li>We therefore investigated the effects of mutations at the fifth and sixth positions of the inverted repeat elements on pnirB expression in the absence of NarL , The results in Table 1 show that three of the four single mutations decrease NarL-independent stimulation of pnirB expression by nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL is required for both the induction and repression by nitrate of the expression of enzymes involved in alternative pathways of anaerobic respiration -LCB- Stewart , 1982 ; luchi and Lin , 1987 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2041473" target="_blank">2041473</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2160397" target="_blank">2160397</a>]<br></li>
<li>The main effecf was an anaerobic repression by ArcA and a nitrate stimulation by NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565112" target="_blank">7565112</a>]<br></li>
<li>Future experiments must show why , in the long i ` usion -LCB- nuosgg ) , the anaerobic repression of nuo by ArcA and the nitrate stimulation by NarL is largely lost .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565112" target="_blank">7565112</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previous studies using a nuo-lacZ fusion established that nuo expression is also subject to ArcA-mediated anaerobic repression and NarL nitratemediated anaerobic activation ( 28 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12754220" target="_blank">12754220</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of the nuo277 - / acZ fusions was subject to ArcA-mediated anaerobic repression and NarL -LCB- -  nitrate ) - mediated anaerobic activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565112" target="_blank">7565112</a>]<br></li>
<li>A previous study using nuo-lacZ fusions established that nuo expression is subject to ArcA-mediated anaerobic repression and NarL nitrate-mediated anaerobic activation ( 38 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15699038" target="_blank">15699038</a>]<br></li>
<li>At high nickel concentrations ( IV ) , NikR is the dominant regulator of PnikABCDE expression regardless of the presence of nitrate ( i.e. , NarL ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16159764" target="_blank">16159764</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is important to note that the presence of functional NarL is not sufficient for narGHJI expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412675" target="_blank">8412675</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , according to the current model , when nitrate is also present , the NarL regulatory protein is activated , and NarL phosphate then binds to the fdhF upstream region to suppress expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>As additional NarL protein is activated in the presence of higher levels of nitrate ( ca. 7 mM ) , it fully displaces the NarP phosphate from the DNA and maximally induces fdnG expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>At increased levels of nitrate , the NarL phosphate protein binds to the sites at positions 109 and 100 and replaces the NarP protein ; NarL phosphate then maximally induces fdnG expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ﬁrst protein , NarL ( 8 ) , represses adhE expression , but this occurs only in the presence of nitrate ( 5 , 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10601216" target="_blank">10601216</a>]<br></li>
<li>The presence of a low nitrate level weakly induces fdnG expression due to the low level of phosphorylated NarL protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nitrate-dependent increase in moe expression required the NarL protein , while the anaerobiosis-de-pendent increase in moeA-lacZ expression required Arc proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nitrate-dependent increase in moe expression is mediated through its cognate activator protein , NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>When low-nitrate conditions are encountered , NarL protein ( L ) binds at the two heptamer sites at 274 and 265 to activate nirB expression ( 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of a functional NarL protein , nitrate did not stimulate expression either with pMW61 under anaerobic conditions or with the consensus -10 derivative ( pMW616 ) under aerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1735706" target="_blank">1735706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Effect of narX mutations on nitrate-dependent induction of narG-lacZ expression and repression of frdA-lacZ expressiona b-Galactosidase sp act Plasmid ( genotype ) narG-lacZ frdA-lacZ These results indicate that the NarL protein can not be activated in the narX mutant strains , possibly because of a defect in the kinase activity of the mutant NarX proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that the NarL protein is largely responsible for the nitrate repression of adhE expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8423158" target="_blank">8423158</a>]<br></li>
<li>These proteins appear to continually inactivate the NarL protein in vivo and thus abolish nitrate-dependent activation or repression of gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>Competition between NarL-dependent activation and Fis-dependent repression controls expression from the Escherichia coli yeaR a ogt promoters The Escherichia coli NarL protein is a global gene regulatory factor that activates transcription at many target promoters in response to nitrate and nitrite ions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>WhereasFnris requiredfor activation of narGHJI expression in response to anaerobiosis , NarL is essential for nitrate - and molybdate-dependent activation of n a r c ( 3 , 9 , 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8419352" target="_blank">8419352</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the corresponding change , narL503 ( H15L ) , did not lead to constitutive activation and repression by NarL , but rather abolished its ability to regulate gene expression in response to nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2066339" target="_blank">2066339</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL apparently acts as a modul-ator for repression or activation of gene expression in response to the action of the narR gene product ( a putative nitrate sensor ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2648330" target="_blank">2648330</a>]<br></li>
<li>One explanation for this apparent contradiction is that , although nitrate addition , via the action of NarL , represses expression from P1 , it also increases expression from P2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9466267" target="_blank">9466267</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the basal levels of NarL and NarX might be sufﬁcient for the ﬁrst phase ( formate-nitrate oxidoreductase synthesis ) , whereas elevated levels of NarL and NarX , resulting from nitrate induction of narXL operon expression , might be required for full repression of frdA operon expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>Overall expression of the narXL genes was only slightly reduced in the absence of IHF ( Table 3 ) , suggesting that limitation for NarL and/or NarX is not responsible for the severe deficiency in nar operon induction by nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1528882" target="_blank">1528882</a>]<br></li>
<li>Neither Fnr nor NarL boxes can be detected in the promoter region , corroborating the Fnr-independent anaerobic expression of the tor operon , as well as the absence of repression by nitrate ( Pascal et ai .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022286" target="_blank">8022286</a>]<br></li>
<li>( i ) When nitrate was present , NarL , the positive regulator of the nar operon , exerted a direct repression on adhE expression , which was demonstrable even aerobically .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1744060" target="_blank">1744060</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the complete 5 ' region of the nar operon including the NarL box was present , nitrate stimulated both aerobic and anaerobic expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1735706" target="_blank">1735706</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL repression was observed in the absence of added nitrate , and the derepressed level of expression in a narL mutant was much higher than that obtainable in wild-type cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8432709" target="_blank">8432709</a>]<br></li>
<li>This demonstrates that NarL has the major role in nitrate-induced repression of dcuB expression ( Fig. 5Dii ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852003" target="_blank">9852003</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , even in the absence of NarL , nitrate still caused a fourfold repression in dcuB expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852003" target="_blank">9852003</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarL and NarP proteins were required for full nitrate induction of narXL operon expression , whereas the nitrate repression of narP and narQ expression was mediated solely by the NarL protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nitrate repression ofpfl expression mediated by NarL is only minor relative to the repression exhibited on the fumarate reductase operon ( 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3053657" target="_blank">3053657</a>]<br></li>
<li>Second , the degree of nitrate repression of pfl operon expression is not mediated by Fnr but probably by another transcriptional-activator , NarL ( 51 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2651404" target="_blank">2651404</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the inhibitory effect of NarL and nitrate is relatively minor compared to the overall induction of ( napF-lacZ ) expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11844760" target="_blank">11844760</a>]<br></li>
<li>The repressive effect of nitrate on pfl ' - ` IacZ expression is mediated by NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3053657" target="_blank">3053657</a>]<br></li>
<li>This indicates that the effect of nitrate on pfl gene expression is direct and mediated by NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3053657" target="_blank">3053657</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the putative NarL box , located 199 bp upstream of the translation start of narK , was deleted ( Fig. 4 and Table 5 ) , the nitrate-dependent activation narK-lacZ of expression was abolished .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1429433" target="_blank">1429433</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although NarL was required for nitrate-dependent increase in moeA-lacZ expression , NarL-P did not bind to moe DNA under the conditions of the phosphorylation and DNase I protection experiments employed in this study .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11357510" target="_blank">11357510</a>]<br></li>
<li>The effects of nitrate ( via NarL ) and anaerobic derepression ( ArcA dependent ) appeared to be additive , as shown by the high expression of nuoy ^ ^ / lB ' in the arcA background after anaerobic-growth with nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7565112" target="_blank">7565112</a>]<br></li>
<li>The anaerobic expression is dependent only on the downstream Fnr box as for narGHJl expression ; however , the nitrate stimulation depends on the presence of the two NarL boxes and , apparently , on the upstream Fnr box also ( Bonnefoy & DeMoss 1992 and unpubl .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7747940" target="_blank">7747940</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL binding at P1 stimulates expression from P2 The ﬁnding that , in a modE strain , addition of nitrate did not reduce dmsA expression from the full-length fusion ( lPM40 ) suggested that ModE is required along with NarL to mediate nitrate-dependent repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9466267" target="_blank">9466267</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nitrate-dependent repression of fdhF-lacZ expression shown in Fig. 3B was conﬁrmed by batch culture experiments in which NarL negatively regulated gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>All Fnr-dependent promoters so far analyzed are also regulated by NarL , while the nitrate repression of the Fnr-independent promoters , for example fdhF and hyd-17 , are NarL independent ( V. Stewart , personal communication ; S. Lutz , A. Birkmann , and A. Bock , unpublished data ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3053657" target="_blank">3053657</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is in agreement with the demonstration by Stewart and Parales ( 1988 ) that narKgene expression is dependent on the / rans-acting factors Fnr and NarL , which are activated by anaerobiosis and nitrate , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1474901" target="_blank">1474901</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription activation ofthenitratereductase structural gene operon ( narGHJI ) requires the FNR protein for induction by anaerobiosis and the NarL proteinforinduction by nitrate ( STEWART1982 ) .

<li>Common mechanismsfor regulatingfdnGHZ and narGHJZ expression : Previous work has shown that narGHJI operon expression requires FNR for induction by anaerobiosis , and NarL for induction by nitrate ( STEWART1982 ; LI and DEMOS 1988 ; reviewed by STEWART 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2168848" target="_blank">2168848</a>]<br></li>
<li>Anaerobic induction requires the fnr product , Fnr ( reviewed in reference 41 ) , while nitrate gene induction requires the narL gene product , NarL ( 40 , 43 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2649492" target="_blank">2649492</a>]<br></li>
<li>Anaerobic expression of the nar operon requires the Fnr activator , which presumably binds to a site centered at position -41.5 ( 12 ) , but full induction in the presence of nitrate requires the NarL activator , which presumably binds to a site spanning position -195 ( 16 , 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1528882" target="_blank">1528882</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , repression in the presence of oxygen or nitrate was signiﬁcantly reduced with respect to the monocopy fusion , which suggests that an increase in the copy number of caiF renders transcription of the gene less dependent on the anaerobic regulators FNR and NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8631699" target="_blank">8631699</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , open complex formation in the presence of RNA polymerase , which is an indication for active FNR and transcriptional activation , is stimulated by Fe ( II ) Most of the FNR-dependent promoters are regulated by FNR in cooperation with other regulators such as NarL , NarP ( nitrate regulation ) , ArcA , Fur ( ferric uptake regulation ) , or CRP ( cyclic AMP receptor protein , glucose repression ) ( Table 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8588737" target="_blank">8588737</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , the NarL protein is able to activate or repress a number of FNR-dependent promoters in response to nitrate in the growth medium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Other targets for future research Synthesis of three further proteins is strongly up-regu-lated by nitrate-activated NarL during anaerobic-growth in the presence of nitrate but is not dependent on activation by the FNR protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22029434" target="_blank">22029434</a>]<br></li>
<li>The genes for fumarate respiration and related enzymes ( dcuB , frdABCD , fumB , ttdAB , and ttdT ) are subject to anaerobic induction by the oxygen sensor FNR and to nitrate repression by the NarX-NarL two-component system ( 15 , 16 , 37 , 46 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20233924" target="_blank">20233924</a>]<br></li>
<li>The frd ( Con ) mutants such as ECL511 synthesize fumarate reductase aerobically and no longer respond to FNR or nitrate repression mediatedvia NarL , whereas frd ( 0xr ) mutants , ECL515 and 516 , are partially derepressed aerobically , strongly induced by anaerobiosis but still subject to the nitrate effect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2677602" target="_blank">2677602</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression and transport data are consistent with each other insofar as Dcu transport activity and the combined dcuA-and dcuB-lacZ activities are activated anaerobically by FNR , repressed anaerobically in the presence of nitrate by NarL , increased by fumarate or succinate , and weakly affected by ArcA ( 8 , 9 ) .

<li>As NarG is a major catalyst for the formation of NO in the cytoplasm , protection mechanisms become essential when NarL and FNR are both active , which is during anaerobic-growth in the presence of a high concentration of nitrate .

<li>To reveal the extent of direct or indirect regulation by NarX-NarL , RNA was isolated from the parental strain and its isogenic narXL mutant during anaerobic-growth in the presence of nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the expression of nitrate reductase is stimulated by NarL whilst fumarate reductase is repressed , thus ensuring that nitrate is used as an electron acceptor in preference to fumarate .

<li>For exampie , whiist NarL is responsibie for maximum induction of nitrate reductase during anaerobic-growth in the presence of nitrate , FNR-dependent expression of fumarate reductase is repressed by NarL , Thus , NarL ensures that nitrate , rather than energeticaily less rewarding substrates , is used as a terminal electron acceptor ( reviewed by iuchiandLin , 1991 ) .

<li>More directly , with the -13 change in the complete promoter ( plasmid pMV61 , Table 1 ) , nitrate induced the same relative increases in aerobic and anaerobic expression as it did with the wild-type promoter ( data not shown ) , arguing against any change in the mechanism of regulation by NarL .

<li>The mechanism of regulation of ydhY -- T expression by FNR , in response to oxygen availability , and by the NarXL and NarPQ systems , in response to nitrate and nitrite availability , revealed that NarL represses ydhY -- T expression by binding to sites in the promoter region that overlap those occupied by FNR and RNA polymerase .

<li>To examine the roles of NarL and NarP at pnir , the EcoRI-H/ndlll fragment was cloned into the low-copy-number iac expression vector pRW50 , such that iac expression was controlled by pnir The resulting recombinant , pKT1 , was transferred to different genetic backgrounds and iac expression was rrieasured during growth in different conditions ( Table 1 ) , In the narL * narP * background , pnir expression was induced in anaerobic conditions and was further increased in the presence of nitrate or nitrite .

<li>The highest expression level , 6,180 units , was detected during anaerobic-growth of the nsrR mutant in the presence of nitrite , but the activity was slightly lower , 4,880 units , in the absence of nitrite , presumably reﬂecting the smaller effect of NarL and NarP under these conditions .

<li>Enzymes implicated in NO production in the E. coli cytoplasm The NarL-activated narGHJI operon is strongly induced during anaerobic-growth in the presence of high concentrations of nitrate , whereas the nrf operon is repressed by nitrate-activated NarL , but induced by nitrite - or nitrateactivated NarP .

<li>Synthesis of the cytoplasmic nitrite reductase , NirBD , is induced by both NarP and NarL during anaerobic-growth in the presence of nitrate or nitrite .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22092912" target="_blank">22092912</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Effects of a narXL Deletion Mutation on the E. coli Transcriptome ; Definition of the NarXL Regulon -- Some well characterized FNR-dependent promoters are also regulated by NarL in response to the presence of nitrate ( 23 ) , and the regulatory effects , both positive and negative , at many other promoters were most apparent during anaerobic-growth in the presence of nitrate or nitrite .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>The likely explanation for this is that most of the genes controlled by these promoters encode products that play a role in anaerobic respiration of nitrate and nitrite , and thus their expression is fully induced only in both the absence of oxygen ( signalled via FNR ) and the presence of nitrate or nitrite ( signalled by NarL ) [ 4,29,30 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is known that RNS are generated during anaerobic respiration of nitrate and nitrite [ 38 -- 40 ] , and hence it is easy to envisage that the yeaR-yoaG operon helps manage some aspect of RNS stress , after its expression is co-induced by external nitrate or nitrite ions ( sensed by NarL ) and RNS ( sensed by NsrR ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>and that NarL binding is needed for optimal pnirB expression both during growth in anaerobic conditions and during nitrite/nitrate induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>Aerobic expression was independent of ArcA and Fnr , but induction of cydDC by nitrate and nitrite was dependent on NarL and Fnr .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9335308" target="_blank">9335308</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activity of this promoter is totaiiy dependent on FNR and partialiy dependent on NarL : expression is induced by anaerobic-growth conditions but optimai activity depends on the inciusion of nitrite or nitrate in the growth medium ( Griffiths and Coie , 1987 ; Page et ai , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conclude that any second factor is likely to-bind to sequences similar to NarL , Note that the single and double mutations also reduce the FNR-dependent pnirB expression during anaerobic-growth in the absence of externally added nitrite or nitrate , suggesting that both NarL and the second factor are needed for optimal anaerobically induced FNR-dependent transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of NarL in the presence of nitrate requires phosphorylation of Asp-59 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2066339" target="_blank">2066339</a>]<br></li>
<li>These in vivo data correlate well with the in vitro ﬁndings that NarX phosphorylation and NarL activation occur gradually over a range of nitrate concentrations ( 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to the nar operon , the frd and tor operons are repressed by NarL in the presence of nitrate ( 8,12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3138237" target="_blank">3138237</a>]<br></li>

<li>NarL is a response-regulator that , when phosphorylated , has increased afﬁnity for DNA ( 22 ) , suggesting a direct mechanism for nitrate-dependent regulation of Pnik .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16159764" target="_blank">16159764</a>]<br></li>
<li>Sensitivity of the DcuS-PAS domain to oxygen , nitrate , redox status , or metabolic status might partly explain the FNR - , NarL - , and CRP-independent regulation of dcuB expression by oxygen , nitrate , and glucose , respectively ( 12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9973351" target="_blank">9973351</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like cai and ﬁx operons , the caiF gene appeared to be positively controlled by CRP and FNR and negatively controlled by H-NS and the NarL ( plus nitrate ) regulator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9573142" target="_blank">9573142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Appropriately , both are anaerobically induced by FNR and repressed by NarL in response to nitrate ( 14 , 17 ) , thus ensuring that oxygen and nitrate are utilized in preference to fumarate as terminal electron acceptors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852003" target="_blank">9852003</a>]<br></li>
<li>results conﬁrm that the ogt promoter is induced by NarL in response to nitrate ions , without help from FNR .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>Operons in this group include frdA and dmsA , both of which are known to be subject to hierarchical control by FNR and NarL in response to oxygen and nitrate ( 32 , 33 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , factors other than FNR , NarL , and CRP also appear to contribute to the regulation of dcuB in response to oxygen , nitrate , and glucose .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852003" target="_blank">9852003</a>]<br></li>
<li>It therefore appears that the nitrate repression observed in wild-type cells reflected the additive effects of NarL and the change in cellular redox potential caused by nitrate reduction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1744060" target="_blank">1744060</a>]<br></li>
<li>Loss of NarL led to relief of nitrate repression relative to the levels observed in glucose-grown cells ( Table 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , competition between NarL and ArcA for their corresponding binding sites in the pﬂ promoter-regula-tory region would provide a simple explanation for the variable level of nitrate repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>Presumably repression is the result of nitrate-triggered NarL binding to heptamers - 5 0 and - 2 2 and blocking FNR binding or activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>We suppose that the higher level of active NarL , resulting from nitrate triggering , is sufficient to occupy heptamers - 7 9 , - 7 0 , - 5 0 and - 2 2 , resulting in repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the simplest explanation for the results in Fig. 2 is that NarL protein binds to a site upstream of -57 and is , at least partially , responsible for nitrite and nitrate effects .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>This result shows that NarL is ` active ' in the absence of extracellular nitrate or nitrite and suggests that FNR needs a ` helper ' when in the context of the nirB promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>Mutation of the 242 heptamer ( overlapping the FNR site ) impaired repression in the presence of nitrate , but not nitrite ( Table 4 ) , despite the absence of clear protection of the 242 heptamer by phospho-NarL in the footprinting assay .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18227264" target="_blank">18227264</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that in vivo there are other factors that lead to occupation of the 242 heptamer by NarL in the presence of nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18227264" target="_blank">18227264</a>]<br></li>
<li>The primacy of nitrate ( EQ O ' nitrate/nitrite is - HO .42 ) IS assured by the global regulator NarL -LCB- encoded at min 27 ) acting in concert with nitrate and molybdate as coeffectors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412675" target="_blank">8412675</a>]<br></li>
<li>The direct role of NarL is supported by the observation that in strain ECL1100 nitrate exerted a slight but significant repression even aerobically , when no significant nitrate reductase activity would be expected .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1744060" target="_blank">1744060</a>]<br></li>
<li>The most striking difference between pnrf and pnir is that pnrf activity is effectively repressed by nitrate-triggered NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarL - derivative ( RK5287 ) showed normal oxygen regulation , but enzyme activity failed to be further induced by nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7050087" target="_blank">7050087</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test this , we compared the kinetics of induction of the hcp-hcr promoter by a pulse of sodium nitrate with the induction of the ogt promoter , which is known to be directly activated solely by NarL [ 18 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20533909" target="_blank">20533909</a>]<br></li>
<li>One expects that NarG - ( lack of nitrate reductase ) would be phenotypically dominant to NarL - ( low levels of nitrate reductase activity ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7050087" target="_blank">7050087</a>]<br></li>
<li>This observation complicates the interpretation of our data and , although likely , we have no proof that NarL is directly responsible for nitrate induction of pnirB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>A pchlC3 complemented the NarL mutation and thus allowed wild-type levels of enzyme induction by nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7050087" target="_blank">7050087</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thefnr mutation resulted in a complete lack of induction , whereas the NarL - mutant lacked only the second , nitrate-specific step of induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7050087" target="_blank">7050087</a>]<br></li>
<li>We suggest that the induction of ogt by NarL alone in response to external nitrate provides a prophylactic insurance policy against possible genotoxic effects arising from nitrate metabolism .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>These ﬁndings are consistent with the in vivo data and explain why the narX mutants are unable to activate NarL in response to the nitrate signal .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , narX and narQ gene products appear to each activate NarL when nitrate is present but not to the same degrees .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1429433" target="_blank">1429433</a>]<br></li>

<li>How this response is regulated is unknown , but it might be controlled by the transcription factor NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21265775" target="_blank">21265775</a>]<br></li>
<li>All known NarL - and NarP-regulated target operons are also controlled by the Fnr protein in response to anaerobiosis ( 15 ) as reported here for cydD .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9335308" target="_blank">9335308</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , contrary to our earlier report ( Filenko et al. , 2007 ) , hcp expression is not activated by NarL , but instead it is directly regulated by NsrR in response to NO ( Chismon et al. , 2010 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22029434" target="_blank">22029434</a>]<br></li>
<li>According to the models of Kalman and Gunsalus ( 22 ) and Chiang et al. ( 3 ) , the narL gene product ( NarL ) functions as a response-regulator to activate narK transcription , while the narX and the narQ gene products function as sensortransmitters to detect and report nitrate availability ( 3 , 15 , 30 , 41 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1429433" target="_blank">1429433</a>]<br></li>
<li>The yeaR -- yoaG operon is induced in response to nitric oxide stress ( Justino et al. 2005 ) , and transcription of the yeaR -- yoaG operon is regulated by nitrate-responsive regulator NarL ( Lin et al. 2007 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19919618" target="_blank">19919618</a>]<br></li>
<li>Upon activation by either the NarX or NarQ sensor-transmitter proteins , NarL binds at specific DNA sites to activate narGHJI operon expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8419352" target="_blank">8419352</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nitrate is detected by either of the two sensor-transmitter proteins , NarX or NarQ , which then activate the DNA binding response-regulatory protein NarL , by phosphorylating an aspartate residue located at position 59 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12079504" target="_blank">12079504</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that the NarX and the NarQ wild-type proteins can function independently of each other in vivo to ( i ) activate NarL when nitrate is present and ( ii ) inactivate the NarL protein when no nitrate is available to the cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the observed in vivo induction of narG-lacZ expression when an narL1 plasmid is present ( even when the narX1 or narQ1 gene was not ) suggests that the NarL protein is present in a partially activated form that is independent of either the NarX or NarQ protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>Either NarX or NarQ can transfer this signal to the cognate response-regulator protein , NarL , which then binds DNA to regulate gene expression in response to nitrate availability .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>Because neither NarX-phosphate nor NarQ-phosphate is being formed , the subsequent transfer of the phosphate group to the NarL protein to give NarL-phosphate , which binds to DNA and regulates gene expression , is precluded ( 23 , 28 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nitrate-dependent phosphorylation of NarL by the sensor kinases NarX/NarQ promotes the specific binding of NarL-phosphate to its sites , whereas DNA binding by IHF is apparently not regulated by oxygen or nitrate ( Walker and DeMoss , 1994 ; Darwin and Stewart , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11115116" target="_blank">11115116</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results suggest that the nitrate-dependent activation of the op-erons coding for anaerobic nitrate respiration also requires both ModE and MoeA proteins in addition to the nitrate-speci cents c response-regulators , NarL and its cognate sensor , NarX ( or NarQ ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9851041" target="_blank">9851041</a>]<br></li>
<li>If nitrate or nitrite ions are present , NarL is activated ( via NarX or NarQ ) and , upon binding to its target site , IHF is displaced and the repression of FNR-dependent activation is lifted .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>We suppose that , in response to nitrite or nitrate ions , NarL is activated by phosphorylation by the NarX and NarQ sensor kinases , and the activated NarL displaces IHF bound at IHF I and relieves the repression of FNR-dependent transcription initiation at pnir .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15225315" target="_blank">15225315</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , regulation in response to nitrate availability is mediated by a complex two-component system comprising two homologous sensor transmitter proteins , NarX and NarQ , encoded by narX and narQ , and a response-regulator , NarL , encoded by narL ( Chiang et al. , 1992 ; Rabin and Stewart , 1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9466267" target="_blank">9466267</a>]<br></li>
<li>( fdnG-lacZ ) inducer in a narX null strain , is that the equilibrium of the NarX protein , in response to nitrite , is shifted more toward NarL-phosphate phosphatase than NarL kinase activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>A key element for differential regulation in response to nitrate versus nitrite is ligand discrimination by the NarX sensor , which is hypothesized to act as a NarL kinase in response to nitrate but to act primarily as a phospho-NarL phosphatase in response to nitrite .

<li>Previous studies led to the conclusion that negative regulation ( i.e. , phospho-NarL phosphatase activity ) by the NarX protein is a critical aspect of differential target operon expression in response to nitrate versus nitrite ( 25 , 29 , 37 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12644479" target="_blank">12644479</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL activity is controlled via phosphorylation by the NarX and NarQ gene products , which appear to be activated by nitrate ( and nitrite ) in a similar way to other two-component regulatory systems ( reviewed by Stewart , 1993 ) .

<li>Transcription of narGHJI and nirBD is also activated by the NarX-NarL two-component regulatory system in response to moderate concentrations of nitrate ; nirBD , and to a much lesser extent narGHJI , are also activated by the alternative two-component system , unknown .

<li>WhereasFnrfunctionsasan anaerobic responsive sensor for the activation andrepression of gene expression during anaerobiccell growthconditions ( 2 , 7 , 8 ) , NarL functions as a nitrate - and molybdate-dependent response-regulator of the NarX NarQ NarL two-component regulatory system ( 5 , 6 , 9-11 ) .

<li>Effect of narXL and narXLP deletions on the transcriptome during anaerobic-growth in the presence of nitrate The NarX-NarL two-component regulatory system detects and regulates gene expression in response to the availability of high concentrations of nitrate [ 8,9 ] .

<li>This residual induction was absent in narX narQ double-null strains ( 29 ) , indicating that NarX and NarQ communicate the presence of nitrate to a response-regulator other than the NarL protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>For instance , the NarX protein , which functions to activate the regulator protein , NarL , in response to the presence of nitrate and molybdenum , contains the sequence SGRNE ( amino acid positions 204 to 208 ) ( 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8550508" target="_blank">8550508</a>]<br></li>
<li>Either of these sensors is sufficient to signal the presence of nitrate to the response-regulator protein , NarL , a transcriptional-activator and repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Higher intracellular levels of NarX and NarL in the presence of ModE-molybdate , in turn , would increase the response of other nar operons to nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10206709" target="_blank">10206709</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL can be activated by phosphorylation by either NarX or NarQ sensors which signal the presence of nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7747940" target="_blank">7747940</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarX and NarQ are sensor-transmitter proteins that can independently detect the presence of nitrate in the cell environment and transmit this signal to the response-regulator , NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>By operon tightly analogy to other two-component regulatory systems , auto-phosphorylated NarX protein acts as a substrate for NarL phosphorylation ( `` NarL kinase activity '' ) in the presence of nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of nitrite , the NarQ protein acts to phosphorylate NarL with an efficiency approaching that seen in nitrate-grown cultures .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>The presence of nitrite ( or nitrate ) in the growth medium triggers the activity of the NarL and NarP activator proteins : these are closely related regulators , activated by the sensor kinases NarX and NarQ , that bind to a single 16 bp sequence at the nir promoter , centred at position ¹ 69.5 ( note that NarL and NarP are highly homologous , bind to identical target sequences and appa-rently play identical roles in activating transcription at the nir promoter ) ( Tyson et al. , 1993 ; 1994 ; reviewed by Stewart , 1993 ; Darwin and Stewart , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our current model to describe the Nar-mediated regulation of anaerobic enzyme synthesis implicitly assumes that the levels of the NarX , NarL , NarP , and NarQ proteins are essentially constant under different growth conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent work by Rabin and Stewart ( 1993 ) has revealed the presence of a NarL homologue in E. coli , NarP , which is also controlled by NarX and NarQ and can modulate FNR-dependent expression at some promo-ters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the presence of TMAO has a minimal effect on NarX-NarL or NarQ-NarP-dependent induction or repression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , in the absence of NarQ , nitrate-dependent repression of aegA can be mediated by the NarX protein via the NarL and/or NarP protein , as seen for other genes in E. coli ( 11 , 34 , 46 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8955321" target="_blank">8955321</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nitrate repression could be relieved completely only in strains grown in rich medium and unable to synthesize either functional NarL and NarP proteins or NarX and NarQ proteins ( Table 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>This is achieved by two homologous transcription factors , NarL and NarP , which are phosphorylated by the sensor kinases NarX and NarQ ( 23 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18757534" target="_blank">18757534</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conclude that , in wild-type strains , the NarQ protein communicates the presence of nitrite to both the NarP and NarL proteins and that the NarX protein inhibits this communication with the NarL protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Dephosphorylation of NarP is restricted to NarQ , dephosphorylation of NarL to NarX .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9230919" target="_blank">9230919</a>]<br></li>
<li>This implies that the NarQ protein negatively regulates the NarP protein , much like the NarX protein negatively regulates the NarL protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>

<li>We show that activation of pnrf in response to nitrite requires an inverted pair of NarL heptamers , and , as at pnir , these heptamers are a target for both NarP and NarL , Nitrate-triggered NarL-dependent repression of pnrf is dependent on occupation of a second pair of heptamers flanking the FNR-binding site .

<li>The GA85 substitution suppresses nitrite-dependent stimulation of pnrf , suggesting again that nitrite-triggered NarL or NarP Interacts in some way with FNR , and that this interaction can be disrupted by an alteration in FNR .

<li>It is especially intriguing that binding of IHF to IHF I and to IHF II at the nir promoter produces opposing effects , and it is the balance between these effects that sets the level of FNR-dependent expression in the absence of nitrate/nitrite-dependent activation via NarL or NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18757534" target="_blank">18757534</a>]<br></li>
<li>The primary role of IHF , mediated by binding at the IHF I target , is also to downregulate FNR-dependent activation , but this can be reversed by NarP or NarL in response to nitrite or nitrate ions in the environment ( 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20472787" target="_blank">20472787</a>]<br></li>
<li>The simplest explanation for our results is that FNR-dependent expression from pnircan be further stimulated by nitrite - or nitrate-triggered NarL or nitrate-triggered NarP binding to the inverted repeat .

<li>On the other hand , the level of # rd / # rd-red mRNA almost doubled in nitrite-grown strains defective in narP and/or narL , showing that under these growth conditions NarL and NarP proteins act as negative regulators of the # rd operon .

<li>From this , we conclude that the nitrite response element from the nir promoter can be transplanted to the nrf promoter and that it retains its property of being activated strongly in response to nitrite by NarL but not NarP .

<li>The regulation of nap and nrf has been characterized previously ( 6 , 10 , 24 , 29 , 30 ) ; NarL antagonizes transcription activation in the presence of nitrate , but in the narXL mutant this repression is lifted , and NarP activates transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>Second , nitrate and nitrite activation is solely dependent on NarP but is antagonized by the NarL protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>

<li>Our results , reported here , indicate that overall nitrate - and nitrite-responsive control of - operon transcription yeaR yoaG results from a combination of activation by the phospho-NarL protein and repression by the NsrR protein .

<li>This also shows that the inﬂuence of the narL and narP null alleles on yeaR-yoaG operon expression reﬂects a direct effect of phospho-NarL and - NarP proteins on transcription activation rather than an indirect effect of altered nitrate and nitrite metabolism in narL and narP null strains .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17720788" target="_blank">17720788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Whilst repression requires nitrate-triggered NarL , experiments in the narP background show that nitrite-triggered NarL can activate pnrf .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , even if NarL activity is triggered by nitrate or nitrite ions , the yeaR-yoaG operon will not be expressed unless repression by NsrR is lifted .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>, 1994 ) , Rabin and Stewart ( 1993 ) showed that the aeg-93 promoter is reguiated by both NarL and NarP : repression by nitrate is dependent on NarL , whilst activation by nitrite can be effected by NarP or NarL , Hence , in this work , we identified a number of potential NarL hepta-mers at pnrf and exploited site-directed mutagenesis to investigate their roie in NarP - and NarL-dependent regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , the residual nitrate-dependent repression in the narL mutant host is lost in an narL narP double mutant , in which NarP , a NarL homologue , is inactivated ( Fig. 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19251855" target="_blank">19251855</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the narL '' narP ^ background both nitrate repression and nitrite induction were suppressed , suggesting that NarP and NarL are responsible for nitrite induction and nitrate repression , respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , in the narL * narP ~ background , pnrf is subject to nitrate repression but can be activated by nitrite , suggesting that nitrite activation can be effected by both NarL and NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the transcription of genes for the periplasmic Nap-Nrf pathway is activated by NarQ-NarP in response to low concentrations of nitrate ( < 100 lM ) but are repressed by NarX-NarL when nitrate is abundant ( Page et al. , 1990 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22029434" target="_blank">22029434</a>]<br></li>
<li>This assumption is supported by differences in sensitivity of NarX and NarQ to nitrate and nitrite , as well as differences in their ability to interact with NarL , and in the specificity of the DNA target operons bound by NarL and NarP ( Schröder et al. , 1994 ; Darwin & Stewart , 1995 ; and unpublished work ) .

<li>Future studies to examine the roles of the two sensor-transmitter proteins , NarX and NarQ , and the two response-regulators , NarL and NarP , should be informative concerning differences in the abilities of the two sensortransmitter proteins and the two response-regulator proteins to modulate nitrate-dependent induction of the narGHJI and the napF operons .

<li>We provide genetic evidence that either the NarX or the NarQ protein can interact with the NarL and NarP proteins to regulate target operon expression in response to nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , we found that nitrite ( NO2 - ) , the reduction product of nitrate , also acts to control target operon expression through the NarX , NarQ , NarL , and NarP proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regulation of aeg-93 is more complex than that of aeg-46 .5 , since nitrite is an effective activator and it appears that NarL represses expression in the presence of nitrate but activates it in the presence of nitrite , while NarP is an activator with both nitrate and nitrite .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results show that the NarP protein activates F ( aeg-46 .5 - lacZ ) expression in response to nitrate and nitrite and that the NarL protein antagonizes this activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>This shows that the NarL protein represses ` I ( aeg-93-lacZ ) expression in response to nitrate but activates expression in response to nitrite .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although fdhF expression was reported to be activated by formate and repressed by nitrate , neither NarL nor NarP was tested to determine its role in nitrate - or nitrite-dependent fdhF gene expression ( 21 , 29 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>The different expression proﬁle for the alternative nitrite reductase operon encoded by nirBDC under high-nitrate conditions was due to transcriptional activation by either NarL or NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both NarL and NarP activate the expression of nitrate and nitrite catabolic genes and repress other anaerobic respiratory systems like fumarate reductase ŽFrd .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9230919" target="_blank">9230919</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , when nitrite was present , NarP did not antagonize NarL activation of nirB-lacZ expression to the extent that it did when nitrate was present ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since nitrite induction was observed aerobically ( Table 2 ) and both nitrate and nitrite enhanced F ( hmp-lacZ ) 1 expression in a NarL - and NarP-independent manner ( Table 3 ) , we considered the possibility that reduction of these ions to NO might be the cause of enhanced expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8808940" target="_blank">8808940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Most of the nitrate and nitrite induction of the fdnG operon is mediated by NarL , although NarP can weakly induce expression ( 23 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both the NarL and NarP proteins were required for full nitrate and nitrite induction of F ( narX-lacZ ) expression and for full nitrite induction of F ( narK-9lacZ ) expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>These ﬁndings therefore require a reexamination of the regulatory models based on batch culture studies wherein NarL or NarP can activate nrfA expression in response to nitrite only ( 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Also , since NarL and NarP clearly function in more versatile ways in response to either nitrate or nitrite as a regulatory signal , the prior models based on the batch culture studies must be reconsidered ( 6 , 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>From prior batch culture experiments , both NarL and NarP were reported to activate nirB-lacZ in response to nitrate ( 23 , 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>During batch cell culture conditions , nitrite was reported to induce nrfA expression via either the NarL or NarP response-regulator proteins , while only nitrate was reported to cause repression of nrfA expression and only by NarL ( 14 , 16 , 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>In summary , NarP was the less-effective response-regulator for inducing nirB-lacZ expression relative to NarL when either nitrate or nitrite was present as the inducer signal .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is therefore evident that NarL and NarP regulate nrfA-lacZ expression in response to nitrite addition in the same qualitative way that the nitrate anion signal does in contrast to prior proposals .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>While either NarL or NarP was able to induce nrfA-lacZ expression in response to low levels of nitrate , only NarL could repress at high nitrate levels .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , either NarL or NarP can activate nrfA-lacZ expression in response to added nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , NarL is reported to repress nrfA expression in response to nitrate , whereas NarP can not ( 14 -- 16 , 23 , 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of the nirB operon differs from nrfA in that NarL and NarP are reported to activate nirB expression in response to nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>These sensors then act to control the phosphorylation state of the regulators NarL and NarP ( Darwin & Stewart , 1996 ; Yamamoto et al. , 2005 ) , and there is a complex exchange of information between the sensors and the regulators to allow fine control of targetgene expression in response to nitrate and nitrite .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18227264" target="_blank">18227264</a>]<br></li>
<li>The conclusions derived from batch culture and chemostat experiments for NarL - and NarP-dependent control of nrfA and nirB gene regulation in response to nitrate and nitrite are summarized in Table 3 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Many of these target promoters control the expression of gene products involved in the reduction of nitrate or nitrite and , hence , NarL and NarP are thought to be the principal regulators of nitrate and nitrite metabolism .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20533909" target="_blank">20533909</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recall that NarL and NarP are homologous response-regulators whose activity is triggered by nitrite or nitrate ions ( 10 ) , and this provides a simple mechanism for the induction of nrf operon expression in response to environmental nitrite or nitrate ( 26 , 28 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20472787" target="_blank">20472787</a>]<br></li>
<li>The addition of nitrite , but not nitrate , is reported to further elevate nrfA expression via either the NarL or NarP response-regulators .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarL and NarP response-regulators mediate nitrate and nitrite induction of anaerobic respiratory gene expression in E. coli ( 49 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8808940" target="_blank">8808940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Various target operons regulated by nitrate appear to have different speciﬁcities for NarL and NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9335308" target="_blank">9335308</a>]<br></li>
<li>The various target operons regulated by nitrate appear to have different speciﬁcities for NarL and NarP , and this provides a means of ﬁnetuning gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the case of hya operon regulation , both NarL and NarP appear to be equally effective at repressing expression in the presence of nitrate ( see Table 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL and NarP appear to be responsible for repression of hya expression in response to nitrate ( 5 , 31 ) , whereas the anaerobic transcription factors ArcA and AppY are required for the increased expression of the hya operon in response to anaerobiosis ( 5 , 31 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23065979" target="_blank">23065979</a>]<br></li>
<li>One possible explanation for the enhanced nitrate-dependent repression of hya gene expression in the narP mutant is that normally NarL and NarP compete to repress hyb operon expression , with NarP binding being favoured .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>
<li>Anaerobic expression required a functional fnr gene , and nitrate repression depended on NarL and NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19661178" target="_blank">19661178</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nitrate repression could however be relieved in a narL narP double mutant , indicating that both NarL and NarP mediate nitrate repression of hya expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>
<li>The effect of NarL ( and NarP ) on the expression of the dcuB-lacZ fusion was measured in the presence and absence of nitrate ( Fig. 5D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852003" target="_blank">9852003</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , in the absence of NarL , dcuB is repressed fourfold by nitrate in a manner that appears to be NarP independent , and , in addition , dcuB expression is reduced by glucose in a fashion that is mostly CRP independent .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852003" target="_blank">9852003</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of dcuC * 9-9lacZ was increased by a factor of about 2.2 compared to that in the wild type , but the responses to oxygen , nitrate , and the regulators FNR , NarL , and NarP were comparable to those in the wild type ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10368146" target="_blank">10368146</a>]<br></li>
<li>The chemostat experiments ( Fig. 3A ) also demonstrate that NarL or NarP can function independently of each other to induce nirB expression in response to nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>The mechanism which the cell employs to repress pﬂ expression with nitrate clearly involves NarL and NarP , but a further factor ( s ) which dictates whether repression is strong or weak , perhaps in response to the intracellular redox status , must be involved .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL is the more proﬁcient activator under low-nitrate conditions , where NarP antagonizes NarL binding ( Fig. 4A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>In these instances , nitrate-triggered NarL can stimulate pnir activity whilst nitrite-triggered NarL ( or nitrate-triggered NarP ) is ineffective , again presumably because the binding of the latter to the mutated sites is insufficient .

<li>Effects of NarL heptamer mutations on regulation of pnrf by nitrite and nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>The role of NarL heptamer sequences at pnrf The results In Table 1 suggest that NarL and NarP are responsible for nitrite and nitrate regulation at pnrf .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Conclusions Beta-galactosidase Activities This work has focused on the roles of NarL and NarP in nitrite/nitrate regulation at pn/r and pnrf and the identification of c/s-acting sequences that are essential for this regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nitrite and nitrate regulation of nir and nrf operon expression is mediated by the NarL and NarP proteins ( Tyson et al. 1993 , 1994 ) : whilst transcription from the nir promoter is induced by both nitrite and nitrate , transcription of the nrf operon is induced by nitrite but repressed by nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9382703" target="_blank">9382703</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , the role of the regulatory systems NarL and NarP , which integrate signals resulting from the presence of nitrate or nitrite , in # rd / # rd-red transcription was investigated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12586421" target="_blank">12586421</a>]<br></li>
<li>Conversely , synthesis of the NADH-dependent nitrite reductase , NirBD , is induced by both nitrate and nitrite ; transcription of the nir operon is equally activated by both NarL and by NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>as by-products of nitrate and nitrite metabolism this means that nitrate - or nitrite-induced changes in transcription can be mediated by NsrR as well as by NarL and NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20533909" target="_blank">20533909</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression can be increased in response to nitrite or nitrate ions by the nitrite/nitrate-triggered NarL or NarP response-regulators that bind to an upstream site at position -74.5 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>We proposed that the binding of NarL or NarP to a site centred between positions 269 and 270 counteracts this suppression , resulting in increased transcription in response to nitrite or nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10972841" target="_blank">10972841</a>]<br></li>
<li>These operons are likely to be regulated by NarL and either NarP , as is the case of hcp , or other transcription factors in response to nitrate or other stimuli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>the transcription activator FNR ( fumarate-nitrate regulation ) in response to anaerobiosis , and by transcription regulators NarL and NarP in response to nitrite and nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15667305" target="_blank">15667305</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similarly , the presence of nitrate or nitrite ions leads to the activation of NarL and its homologue , NarP , which belong to the response-regulator family of transcription factors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20533909" target="_blank">20533909</a>]<br></li>
<li>Either of the response-regulators , NarL or NarP , was sufﬁcient to confer maximal nitrate and nitrite repression in rich medium , while the NarL protein appeared to be marginally more effective when cells were grown in minimal medium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>Together , NarL and NarP appear to co-ordinate transcriptional responses to nitrate and nitrite , although , as yet , the precise relationship between NarL and NarP is not clear ( Stewart , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Second , we suppose that nitrate and nitrite trigger NarL and NarP to different activities , with nitrate being more effective in both cases .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Each of the sensors responds to nitrate and nitrite as well , and each is able to phosphorylate both regulators NarL and NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9230919" target="_blank">9230919</a>]<br></li>
<li>Taken together , these results suggest that NarL is largely sufficient for induction of pnir in response to both nitrate and nitrite , NarP is sufficient for limited induction of pnir and can replace NarL in mediating nitrate - but not nitrite-induced effects .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription is also induced by NarL and NarP in response to nitrite , but is repressed by NarL in the presence of nitrate [ 11,18 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10548535" target="_blank">10548535</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , the expression of YdeP might be induced in response to varieties of the environmental signal such as an acidic condition ( through EvgSA ) , in the presence of nitrate/nitrite ( through NarXQ-NarL and NarXQ-NarP ) or in the presence of formate and ace-tate ( through BarA-UvrY ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26010043" target="_blank">26010043</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consequently , some promoters , for example one of the two napF promoters regulating expression of the periplasmic nitrate reductase operon [ 11 ] , and the nrfA promoter , are activated by NarP in response to nitrite or low concentrations of nitrate , but repressed by NarL when nitrate is abundant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16417494" target="_blank">16417494</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription initiation at the nrfA promoter is activated by FNR in the absence of oxygen and induced further by NarL and NarP in response to low concentrations of nitrate or to nitrite ( 35 , 44 ) .

<li>For some target genes , FNR is the only regulator , whereas most are regulated coordinately by FNR and the regulators ArcA , NarL , NarP ( nitrate/nitrite regulation ) , Fur ( Fe regulator ) , SoxRS and Q ( regulation by O2̇ ¯ ) , LexA ( SOS regulation ) , or CRP ( glucose regulation ) .

<li>Integration of three signals at the Escherichia coli nrf ole f Summary Expression from the Escherichia coli nrf operon promoter is activated by the anaerobically triggered transcription factor , FNR , and by the nitrate/nitrite ioncontrolled response-regulators , NarL or NarP , but is repressed by the IHF and Fis proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Summary Expression from both the Escherichia coli nir and nrf promoters is dependent on anaerobic induction by FNR but is further reguiated by NarL and NarP in response to the presence of nitrite and nitrate in the growth medium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>In our recent microarray study of the FNR , NarL , and NarP regulons of E. coli , members of the NsrR regulon were up-regulated in cultures growing anaerobically in the presence of nitrate and nitrite , presumably as a consequence of NO formation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17449618" target="_blank">17449618</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , in contrast to the well characterized effects of nitrate , nitrite , NarL , and NarP at the nrf and nap promoters , which are activated by NarP but antagonized or repressed by NarL , the dcuB-fumB operon was strongly repressed by both nitrate and nitrite , suggesting that it might provide the first example of a promoter that is repressed by NarP as well as by NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the architecture of the ydhY -- T promoter appears to be somewhat different from that of previously characterized FNR - , NarL - and NarP-regulated promoters , having evolved to be repressed in the presence of nitrate and nitrite by using NarP/NarL to inhibit RNA polymerase binding , and NarL to inhibit FNR binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18227264" target="_blank">18227264</a>]<br></li>
<li>Many FNR-activated promoters are also regulated by NarL and its homologue , NarP , which share the same consensus target sequence and orchestrate adaptation to the presence of nitrate ions ( 6 , 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19251855" target="_blank">19251855</a>]<br></li>
<li>A further striking result is that the regulation of six of the operons implicated in the management of reactive nitrogen species , hcp-hcr , ygbA , ygiS , yeaR-yoaG , yibHI and ytfE , is only partially dependent on NarL or NarP : nitrate induction from these promoters was detected even in the narXL narP deletion strain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16417494" target="_blank">16417494</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similar differences were observed in the regulation by nitrate of genes for hydrogenase synthesis : the hyaABCDEF and hyc ¬ ABCDEFGH operons were repressed by both NarL and NarP ; the hyb operon was repressed only by NarL ( Figures 1C and 1D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16417494" target="_blank">16417494</a>]<br></li>
<li>Among these operons , the napF operon , encoding a periplasmic nitrate reductase , has unique features with respect to its Fnr - , NarL - , and NarP-dependent regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription from most Nar-regulated operons is activated by Fnr , so NarL and NarP impose nitrate-responsive control on top of Fnr-dependent anaerobic induction .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20634237" target="_blank">20634237</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the nitrate reductase genes narGHJI are regulated exclusively by NarL and are not responsive to NarP as observed here for cydD , while nitrate induction of the fdnGHI operon is regulated predominantly by NarL but is also responsive in part to NarP ( 33 , 39 ) .

<li>Thus , for example , the narGHJI operon is regulated exclusively by NarL and is not responsive to NarP , while nitrate induction of the fdnGHI operon is con ¬ * Corresponding author .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>To investigate the effects of the global regulators Fnr , Arc , NarL , and NarP on dcuA and dcuB expression , the fnr , arc , narL , and narP deletions were transferred from the corresponding donor strains , JRG1728 , RM315 , RKP3580 , and RKP3655 , by P1vir-mediated transduction to the dcuA - and dcuB-lacZ fusion strains , JRG3834 and JRG3835 ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852003" target="_blank">9852003</a>]<br></li>
<li>While NarL was still able to activate and to repress nrfA gene expression , the pattern differed from the wild-type nrfA-lacZ reporter fusion ( Fig. 6B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>When high-nitrate or - nitrite conditions are encountered , additional NarL-phosphate molecules are made that then bind at the nearby NarL heptamers ( Fig. 5 ) to inhibit nrfA gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>At elevated-nitrate conditions , additional NarL molecules bind to the ﬂanking NarL heptamer sites at 250 and 222 to repress nrfA operon expression ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , either NarL or NarP was able to activate nrfA-lacZ expression independently of the other , while only NarL could repress expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Second , NarL can repress nrfA-lacZ expression when nitrate is present , whereas NarP can not ( compare the NarL1 NarP2 strain to the NarL2 NarP1 strain and to the wild-type strain ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Signiﬁcantly , NarP also appears to somehow antagonize the ability of NarL to activate nirB-lacZ expression at low nitrate levels since , in a NarP2 NarL1 strain , nirB-lacZ expression was higher relative to the wild-type strain during low nitrate additions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Lastly , NarP appears to weakly antagonize the ability of NarL to activate nrfA-lacZ expression at low nitrate levels ( compare the NarL1 NarP2 strain to the wild-type strain ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of low levels of nitrate , either NarL ( L ) or NarP ( P ) bind at the 270 and 279 heptamer sites ( hatched boxes ) to activate nrfA gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rather , the che-mostat experiments ( Fig. 4A ) revealed that NarP protein acts to antagonize or spoil the ability of the NarL protein to activate gene expression at intermediate nitrate levels ( i.e. , it functions as a negative regulator ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>At low to intermediate levels of nitrate ( 2 to 6 mM ) NarP appeared to antagonize the ability of NarL to activate fdnG operon expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarP thus performs a unique role to ﬁne-tune fdnG operon expression by delaying the ability of NarL to activate when nitrate levels are low .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Either NarL or NarP was able to induce nirB-lacZ expression in response to nitrite ( compare the NarL2 NarP1 and the NarL1 NarP2 strains to the wild-type strain [ Fig. 3B ] ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Third , NarL is the more effective response-regulator in activating nrfA-lacZ expression at low nitrate levels ( as revealed by comparing the NarL1 NarP2 and the NarL2 NarP1 strains ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast to NarP , when NarL phosphate is bound to DNA , it can successfully interact with FNR and/or RNA polymerase to switch on fdnG gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Signal output through NarL phosphate and NarP phosphate continuously adjusts fdnG gene expression in response to the environmental signal input .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarX and/or NarQ sensors , both NarL and NarP are phosphorylated where either response-regulator can then activate nrfA gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the context of regulated gene expression , the napF operon control region is unique among known Nar-regulated targets in both its architecture and its response to the transcriptional-regulators NarL and NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11844760" target="_blank">11844760</a>]<br></li>
<li>The phospho-NarL and phospho-NarP proteins are not direct activators of nirB operon expression , but rather counter the effects of negative regulatory proteins ( 39 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12644479" target="_blank">12644479</a>]<br></li>
<li>One of the more striking points in each model is that the NarP protein is nonessential ( i.e. , not a major player ) and that it can function as an antagonist of NarL in its ability to activate nirB or nrfA operon expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarL protein does not signiﬁcantly activate napF operon expression in the presence of Fnr , whereas the NarP protein does .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>To examine the roles of NarL and NarP , this fragment was cloned into pRW50 to give pKT53 , In which / ac expression was controlled by pnrf .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the nar regulatory system , it is ultimately the concentration of active ( phosphorylated ) NarL and NarP which determines the level of expression of target genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it appears that NarL and NarP adopt overlapping mechanisms to inhibit ydhY -- T expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18227264" target="_blank">18227264</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , evolution appears to have adjusted the binding of IHF to the two targets in order to set the levels of anaerobic nir operon expression in the absence of NarL or NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18757534" target="_blank">18757534</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of NarP , NarL binding is unimpeded and NarL more effectively represses hya expression compared with NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similarly , the homologous NarL and NarP proteins of the nitrate regulon bind to the same sites but regulate differentially ( Darwin et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484892" target="_blank">9484892</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the absence of nitrate , fdnG expression is minimal since the NarL and NarP regulatory proteins are in their inactivate forms and therefore unable to recognize and bind DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Studies to resolve the individual contributions of the NarL and NarP proteins at low substrat levels to the activation and repression of napF gene expression are in progress .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10464201" target="_blank">10464201</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phosphorylation increases the afﬁnity of the NarL and NarP proteins for their speciﬁc DNA binding sites , from whence they activate and repress target operon expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12644479" target="_blank">12644479</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is yet unclear if ModE interactions with molybdate act primarily to modulate DNA binding or , alternatively , to affect ModE interactions with other proteins involved in napF gene expression , including Fnr , NarP , NarL , and RNAP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12029041" target="_blank">12029041</a>]<br></li>
<li>Genes and regulators responding to O2 and other acceptors FNR and ArcA , as shown earlier for NarL and NarP , control different sets of target genes Žreviewed in w4 ,5,9,11,12,44 x.

<li>To determine whether either of the two conserved histidines or the conserved asparagine residue in the NarX and NarQ proteins ( Fig. 1 ) is required for nitrate-dependent signal transduction to NarL , we performed site-directed mutagenesis on the narQ and narX genes .

<li>These observations suggest that the interaction of NarL with the nar operon promoter region does not occur by a simple loop mechanism but probably requires the formation of a specific nucleoprotein structure ( 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1528882" target="_blank">1528882</a>]<br></li>
<li>There is a 24 residue linker in CheB ( the chemotaxis receptor methylesterase ) and a 31 residue linker in NarL ( a transcriptional regulator belonging to a different subfamily ) [ 56,57 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9016718" target="_blank">9016718</a>]<br></li>
<li>One can even go one step further , and ask whether the displacement along helixes R1 between the two crystal forms might bear some relationship to conformations involved in the activation of NarL by phosphorylation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>( d ) NarL monomers have a strong tendency toward dimerization involving contacts between helixes R1 in the two monomers , and this may have mechanistic significance in DNA-binding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , NarL seems to show a tendency toward close association , or even dimerization , involving contacts between helixes R1 ( Figure 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>But in both crystal forms , NarL has a strong tendency to form local dimers involving packing of helixes R1 against one another ( Figure 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is highly likely that NarL dimerizes in vivo via R1 contacts , and that the intermolecular crystal contacts seen in Figure 14 reflect this tendency .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>

<li>It is likely that the linker is exposed andlor perhaps disordered , as is found in the crystal structure of NarL [ 57 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9016718" target="_blank">9016718</a>]<br></li>
<li>A valine-to-alanine substitution would reduce the tendency of residue 88 to fold into the interior in aqueous solution , and could result in the same conformation as that seen in the crystal structure of NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>Some structural rearrangement presumably is necessary , but the nature of this change is unknown because the phosphorylated form of NarL to date has been too easily dephosphorylated for a crystal structure analysis to be carried out .

<li>The validity of this working model , of course , depends upon our having selected the proper duo of N and C domains in outlining a single NarL molecule , and on their remaining in a functionally relevant relationship when packed within the crystal .

<li>The final model includes residues 5-142 and 155-216 of NarL , 6 platinum atoms in 2 clusters , 3 glycerol molecules , and 70 molecules of water .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL on the corresponding helices R1 , R2 , and R3 of paired protein yields a RMS deviation of only 0.83 Å for the CR atoms of 38 contiguous residues .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>The best fit was obtained by superimposing residues 161-198 of NarL and residues 24-61 of paired protein ; the RMS deviation for 38 CR atoms of these residues is 0.83 Å .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the representative comparison of close relatives of NarL shown in Figure 4 of reference 1 , DegU is seen to have an interdomain loop that is 13 residues longer than that of NarL , whereas UhpA and TrpO have loops that are 10 residues shorter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>These His and Asp residues were conserved in all members of the sensor/regulator systems including NarX/NarL ( Figs. 3 and 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>
<li>Six residues , highly conserved within the NarL family ( Figure 4 ) , appear to be responsible for the similarity of folding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>The remaining residues shown in Figure 8 interact with the phosphate backbone of the duplex , and most are highly variable among members of the NarL family .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>FNR alone appears sufﬁcient for this , but NarL can enhance FNR-dependent open complex formation without assistance from any other factor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>RNAP binding and that , in the presence of NarL , a new highly retarded complex appears that , most likely , contains NarL , FNR , and RNAP bound together to the ynfE promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19251855" target="_blank">19251855</a>]<br></li>
<li>Distinct carboxyl-terminal similarities shared bJ this latter group , in comparison with OmpR-type sequences , include the regions corresponding to NarL residues 166 to 183 and 197 to 207 and the 9-residue gap between NarL residues 183 and 184 ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2649492" target="_blank">2649492</a>]<br></li>
<li>Comparison of these three structures shows the following : ( a ) The pairing of N and C domains of the NarL molecule proposed from the earlier analysis is in fact correct , although the polypeptide chain connecting domains was , and remains , disordered and not completely visible .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>Or , since the polypeptide tether connecting domains is not visible in the X-ray analysis , it could even be that the wrong N - and C-terminal domains have been chosen in our extraction of one complete NarL molecule .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the four C domains extend out to the four corners of the tetrahedron , and do not even make close contacts with neighboring NarL tetrahedra .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>Dotted lines in each diagram indicate the unseen tether between domains in NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the intact response regulators NarL and CheB , juxtapositioning of the regulatory domains and the functional regions of the effector domains suggests a structural basis for inhibition .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10966457" target="_blank">10966457</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the case of NarL , the structure of the intact protein , receiver and output domains , was determined .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9367763" target="_blank">9367763</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ogt102 fragment carries substitutions at positions − 84 and − 73 , which disrupt the NarL I binding site , and the ogt104 fragment carries substitutions at positions − 51 and − 40 , which disrupt the NarL II binding site ( Figure 4A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the Klebsiella and Erwinia examples , the transcription control region is also different and contains an NsrR protein-binding site ( 40 ) but no apparent phospho-NarL or - NarP protein-binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17720788" target="_blank">17720788</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the yeaR-yoaG operon control region , the phospho-NarL binding site is immediately adjacent to the promoter 35 element ( Fig. 1A ) , so activation likely operates through direct contacts with RNA polymerase ( a class II mechanism ) as deﬁned initially for activation by the cyclic AMP receptor protein ( 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17720788" target="_blank">17720788</a>]<br></li>
<li>To avoid possible bias in tracing the missing interdomain chain , the monoclinic structure was solved by molecular replacement using only those portions of the orthorhombic NarL molecule that were clear and unambiguous : residues 6-126 of the N domain and residues 158-210 of the C domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>Once the Cterminal region of s70 was modeled onto the MarA-DNA complex , the DNA onto which NarL was initially modeled was deleted and s70 residue 599 was highlighted .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10940041" target="_blank">10940041</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL residue Lys-188 contacts DNA positions 5 , 6 and 7 , which are less conserved in NarL heptamer sequences and therefore may be less critical for overall affinity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20634237" target="_blank">20634237</a>]<br></li>
<li>All ﬁve sites of NarL-DNA interaction contain at least one sequence that conforms to the NarL heptamer consensus ( 5 , 38 ) TAC C/T N A/C T in minimally six positions ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>This His6-NarL-CTD protein is virtually identical to that used for X-ray analysis of NarL -- DNA interaction , which has an amino terminus of MRGSH GSATTERD ... ( Maris et al. , 6 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20634237" target="_blank">20634237</a>]<br></li>
<li>We have succeeded in purifying the NarP protein , and like NarL , it shows no speciﬁc interaction-with-DNA in the ( presumably ) dephosphorylated state .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>To determine whether NarL - and NikR-dependent regulation of Pnik expression were independent , LacZ levels were measured in nikR-deﬁcient and nikR narLX-deﬁcient strains containing wild-type NikR or a mutant protein , the Cys95Ala protein , which lacks high-afﬁnity nickel-binding activity and shows no DNA-binding in vitro with up to 1 M NiCl2 ( 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16159764" target="_blank">16159764</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recombinant protein contains residues 2-216 of the wild-type NarL sequence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>DNase I footprinting studies identiﬁed ﬁve potential binding sites for the wild-type NarL protein in the pﬂ promoter-regulatory region .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601827" target="_blank">7601827</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activated NarX then interacts with the N-terminal region of NarL , resulting in an allosteric or covalent modification of NarL to an active form .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>
<li>Comparison of the A domains of PhoB , OmpR and VirG to a similar amino terminal region in NarL ( positions 41-161 ) showed 27 % , 29 % and 24 % identity respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2648330" target="_blank">2648330</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL , DegU , and UhpA also share uniqde : ly conserved residues within their amino-terminal domains ( Fig. 3 and Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2649492" target="_blank">2649492</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , the arrangement of N - and C-terminal domains in Figure 1 is a correct picture of the unphosphorylated apo-NarL enzyme .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>Most interestingly , YgeK , a NarL family RR , is unique , because it lacks the receiver-domain , which generally contains the conserved Asp residue that is phosphorylated by HK .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15522865" target="_blank">15522865</a>]<br></li>
<li>We have provisionally adopted a `` telephone receiver '' model for NarL activation , in which a receiver base ( the N domain ) and handset ( the C domain ) are connected by a flexible cord ( the nonvisible peptide chain ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>( c ) The `` telephone receiver '' model of NarL activation is confirmed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>The `` telephone receiver '' model of NarL function seems inevitable .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>In full-length NarL , the recognition helix is blocked by the receiver , whereas the dimerization helix is packed against the interdomain linker .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20634237" target="_blank">20634237</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL dimerization ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10960104" target="_blank">10960104</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11976297" target="_blank">11976297</a>]<br></li>
<li>Again , cooperative interactions might contribute to phospho-NarL binding to the upstream end of this region .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15995204" target="_blank">15995204</a>]<br></li>
<li>( 5 ) Is there any evidence for NarL/NarL intermolecular association , of a sort that might be expected if the DNA loops back to bring two NarL/DNA-binding regions into close proximity ?	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>But if the two NarL domains were to rotate or move apart , this paired proteinlike HTH binding might be quite feasible .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nitrate is detected by either of the two sensor-transmitter proteins , NarX or NarQ , which then activate the DNA-binding response-regulatory protein NarL , by phosphorylating an aspartate residue located at position 59 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12079504" target="_blank">12079504</a>]<br></li>
<li>GerEfamily CTDs define one of the three major categories of DNA-binding response regulators ( Galperin , 2006 ) , for which the NarL protein provides a well-studied model .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20634237" target="_blank">20634237</a>]<br></li>
<li>These DNA-binding domains can be subdivided into three major families , represented by OmpR , NarL , and NtrC ( 14 , 7 , and 4 members , respectively , in E. coli ) ( 4 , 63 , 133 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10966457" target="_blank">10966457</a>]<br></li>
<li>The transcription factors NarL and OmpR each contain a recognition helix ( magenta ) , whereas CheB contains a catalytic triad ( magenta spheres ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10966457" target="_blank">10966457</a>]<br></li>
<li>The fold contains a typical helix-turn-helix motif that has allowed postulation of spe-ciﬁc interactions between residues of the recognition helix and bases in the NarL heptamer ( 158 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10966457" target="_blank">10966457</a>]<br></li>
<li>Alanine substitutions were made to examine requirements for residues in the NarL DNA-recognition helix .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20634237" target="_blank">20634237</a>]<br></li>
<li>The re-gulatory domain of the transcription factor NarL blocks access of DNA to the recognition helix ( 158 ) , and the regulatory domain of chemotaxis methylesterase CheB blocks access of the chemoreceptor substrate to the esterase active site ( 159 ; Figure 4c , d ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10966457" target="_blank">10966457</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two regions of continuous electron density were interpreted as residues Pro6-Leu142 of the N-terminal domain and residues Leu156-Val210 of the C-terminal domain of NarL , and were fitted with atomic framework using FRODO ( Jones , 1978 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>Despite analogous mechanisms of regulation , different surfaces of the regulatory domains of NarL and CheB are found at the domain interfaces ( 159 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10966457" target="_blank">10966457</a>]<br></li>
<li>Another rel-ated regulatory protein , NtrC completely lacks the B domain , but shows a 20 % ideintity to NarL with respect to its A domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2648330" target="_blank">2648330</a>]<br></li>
<li>Dimerization is very similar although only approximate between monoclinic molecules A and B , whose FIGURE 15 : Comparison of NarL DNA interaction with that of four other helix-turn-helix or HTH proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>But the inference that the C domain would bind to DNA in a manner that requires it first to dissociate from the N domain is a strong one , and is consistent with the structures observed with the three intact NarL molecules .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>This 15-bp motif is palindromic , as it is typical for a DNA-binding site of a homodi-meric transcriptional regulator and is of similar size to other DNA-binding motifs characterized for transcription regulators of the FixJ/NarL family ( 35 , 36 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26078445" target="_blank">26078445</a>]<br></li>
<li>Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of NarL revealed characteristic helix-turn-helix motif in the C-terminal region which is responsible for binding to the regulatory region of a target gene ( Fig. 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>
<li>The 62 most Cterminal amino acid residues show 47-52 % homology to the domain containing the helix-turn-helix motif in DegU and GerE ( Bacillus subtilis ) , NarL and SdiA ( E. coli ) and RhlR ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8817489" target="_blank">8817489</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL , FimZ , UhpA and RcsB of subgroup ( c ) also certainly fall into the category of response regulator from the existence of phosphoryl-ation domain , although SdiA and MalT show the similarity to the above four regulatory proteins only in the C-terminal region containing the helix-turn-helix motif .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8729576" target="_blank">8729576</a>]<br></li>
<li>RcsB also has more extended homology in its C-terminal domain to the subfamily of regulators containing FixJ , DegU , NarL , and UhpA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2404948" target="_blank">2404948</a>]<br></li>
<li>A third subfamily of transcriptional activator proteins includes UhpA , NarL , DegU , and FixJ ( 34 ) ; they possess the amino-terminal phosphorylation domain , a short variable region , and a carboxyl-terminal region that contains a predicted helix-turn-helix motif .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1569008" target="_blank">1569008</a>]<br></li>
<li>It also is unlikely that an isolated C-terminal domain of NarL alone could dimerize to recognize pairs of either direct or inverted repeats found at different NarL-sensitive promoters , since the domain itself spans less than seven base pairs in the paired-protein modeling of NarL to DNA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>Positioning the C-terminal domain of NarL against a B-DNA duplex exactly as is observed in the DNA complex of Drosophila paired protein even suggests a possible stereochemical basis for NarL specificity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>This has been accomplished by least-squares superposition of the HTH motif of the NarL C domain onto the DNA-bound complex of the test protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>FIGURE 7 : Possible mode of interaction of a DNA duplex ( magenta ) with the C-terminal domain of NarL ( yellow ) , obtained by superposition of the HTH motif of the paired protein/DNA complex on the corresponding residues of NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>In each case , the entire NarL molecule is shown , with its C domain oriented against a DNA duplex in the manner observed in the test protein in question .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>In each case , such an association is completely impossible for an intact NarL molecule because of steric clash between DNA and the N domain , but the C domain alone could form an excellent complex .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , the carboxyl termini of the NarP and NarL proteins contain predicted helix-turn-helix motifs of the type that is found in other DNA-binding proteins such as MalT , FixJ , and RcsA ( Fig. 3 ) ( 18 , 42 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , if the observed `` closed '' conformation of the inactive , unphosphorylated form of NarL is not an artifact of crystal packing , then activation of the protein for DNA-binding must separate N - and C-terminal domains , or at least open a cleft between them .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>Figure 15 shows the hypothetical DNA-binding that would result , if the C domain of NarL were superimposed on the DNA-binding domains of four different HTH proteins in their DNA complexes : paired protein , lambda repressor , CAP , and Trp-repressor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>All proteins of this NarL subfamily have the same type of receiver and DNA-binding domains ( Pao & Saier , 1995 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>The major difference in sequence between UhpA and NarL is that the flexible hinge in UhpA is 10 residues shorter than in NarL , which might rotate the C-terminal region relative to the phosphorylation module and thereby allow continuous exposure of the DNA-binding surface .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8999880" target="_blank">8999880</a>]<br></li>
<li>By predicting the secondary structure of the NarL protein with a GENETYX program , we found the motif in the conserved C-terminal domain as a potential candidate ( Fig. 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>
<li>The identiﬁcation of the UhpA-binding sites by our studies is consistent with the recently determined structure of the C-terminal domain of NarL complexed to its DNA target ( A. E. Maris , M. R. Sawaya , M. Kaczor-Grzewkowiak , M. R. Jarvis , M. L. Kopka , R. P. Gunsalus , and R. E. Dickerson , submitted for publication ) , which shows binding of NarL protein as a dimer in inverted orientation with the majority of protein contacts to the DNA backbone rather than speciﬁc base contacts .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11976297" target="_blank">11976297</a>]<br></li>
<li>( C ) A model of the C-terminal region of s70 ( residues 550 to 613 , orange , based on the DNA-binding domain of NarL ) has been added to the RhaS C-terminal domain model .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10940041" target="_blank">10940041</a>]<br></li>
<li>We modeled s70 residues 550 to 613 based on the DNA-binding domain of NarL ( Brookhaven Data Bank ﬁle 1RNL ) as previously proposed by Lonetto et al. ( 36 ) and substituted the residues of s70 for the NarL residues ( Fig. 4C and D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10940041" target="_blank">10940041</a>]<br></li>
<li>This conclusion is supported by recent X-ray analysis of the NarL protein carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain cocrystallized with a 7-2-7 heptamer pair oligonucleotide ( 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12644479" target="_blank">12644479</a>]<br></li>
<li>Surface analysis of the C-terminal domain of NarL does identify one hydrophobic residue as a potential site for protein-protein interaction : Val189 , which would be exposed in the major groove of DNA next to the first base pair of the binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>But the near-identity of folding of the C domain of NarL with these other HTH proteins makes any other answer to the DNA-binding question unlikely .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9521685" target="_blank">9521685</a>]<br></li>
<li>In spite of the great folding similarity between the C-terminal domain of NarL and other HTH proteins , it can not interact directly with DNA as they do , because the DNA-binding site is blocked by the N-terminal domain ( Figure 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activation of NarL via phosphorylation of Asp59 must involve transfer of information to the interdomain interface and either rotation or displacement of the DNA-binding C-terminal domain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>

<li>For CheB , it has been proposed that 4 and the C-terminal a ends of b5 and a5 of the receiver-domain constitute the interdomain interface that blocks the catalytic site ( 5 ) , whereas for NarL , the loops connecting a2 and b3 , a3 and b4 , and a4 and 5 , i.e. , a different surface , are implicated in blocking the b helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif ( 2 , 3 ) .

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL , FimZ , UhpA and RcsB of subgroup ( c ) also certainly fall into the category of response regulator from the existence of phosphoryl-ation domain , although SdiA and MalT show the similarity to the above four regulatory proteins only in the C-terminal region containing the helix-turn-helix motif .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8729576" target="_blank">8729576</a>]<br></li>
<li>This family also includes UhpA ( 45 ) , FixJ ( 46 ) , DegU ( 47 , 48 ) , and UvrC ORF2 ( 49 ) , which , in addition to the homologous N-terminal domain , shared extensive similarity to NarL over their entire lengths ( Fig. 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>
<li>RcsB also has more extended homology in its C-terminal domain to the subfamily of regulators containing FixJ , DegU , NarL , and UhpA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2404948" target="_blank">2404948</a>]<br></li>
<li>RcsB and its auxiliary regulators all belong to the same family of transcriptional regulators carrying a characteristic C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain of the FixJ-type ( also named LuxR , NarL or UhpA-type ) ( 7,8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24335284" target="_blank">24335284</a>]<br></li>
<li>The RR UhpA , which is composed of a receiver domain that belongs to the RC1 subfamily of receiver domains ( Grebe & Stock , 1999 ) and an output domain belonging to the FixJ -RCB- NarL subfamily ( Parkinson & Kofoid , 1992 ) , becomes activated by phosphorylation of Asp-54 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11739766" target="_blank">11739766</a>]<br></li>
<li>The N-terminal domain of NarL belongs to the FixJ subfamily of receiver domains , which seems not to require a cis peptide bond between Lys109 and Pro110 like that seen in most CheY-like proteins ( Volz , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>The UhpA protein is required for expression ; its deduced amino acid sequence shows that it belongs to a subfamily of bacterial transcription regulators including NarL , DegU , and FixJ .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1569008" target="_blank">1569008</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarL structure is a model for other members of the FixJ or LuxR family of bacterial transcriptional activators , and possibly to the more distant OmpR and NtrC families as well .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>The FixJ or LuxR family , to which NarL belongs , has a single C-terminal domain and ca. 220 amino acids in all .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>The present three-dimensional structure of NarL extends our understanding of the structural conservatism of the receiver domain , provides the first structural template for the FixJ or LuxR family of proteins , and sheds light on the interactions between receiver and effector domains of bacterial response regulators .

<li>However , the strong evolutionary conservatism of Arg19 ( 56 % in the CheY superfamily and nearly 85 % in the NarL family , Figure 4 ) might also indicate that it has a more substantial role .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>Six residues , highly conserved within the NarL family ( Figure 4 ) , appear to be responsible for the similarity of folding .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>The remaining residues shown in Figure 8 interact with the phosphate backbone of the duplex , and most are highly variable among members of the NarL family .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8780507" target="_blank">8780507</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , in a narL mutant that failed to produce protein NarL , one of the regulator components belonging to the two sensor-regulator systems responding to nitrate ( 31 ) , the caiF-lacZ fusion was expressed at a reliable higher level in the presence of nitrate than in the parental strain ( 50 versus 25 % ) .

<li>By operon tightly analogy to other two-component regulatory systems , auto-phosphorylated NarX protein acts as a substrate for NarL phosphorylation ( `` NarL kinase activity '' ) in the presence of nitrate .

<li>The conclusions derived from batch culture and chemostat experiments for NarL - and NarP-dependent control of nrfA and nirB gene regulation in response to nitrate and nitrite are summarized in Table 3 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>Many of these target promoters control the expression of gene products involved in the reduction of nitrate or nitrite and , hence , NarL and NarP are thought to be the principal regulators of nitrate and nitrite metabolism .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20533909" target="_blank">20533909</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , we found that nitrite ( NO2 - ) , the reduction product of nitrate , also acts to control target operon expression through the NarX , NarQ , NarL , and NarP proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarL footprint data ( Fig. 5 ) strongly support the hypothesis that NarL phosphate plays a direct role in the control of fdhF gene-expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>A series of experiments will be necessary to determine the exact role of phospho-NarL in controlling aspA gene-expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15995204" target="_blank">15995204</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , phospho-NarL protein was the predominant activator of nnrS gene-expression in E. coli .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17720788" target="_blank">17720788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , NarL is a negative regulator of gene-expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rather , the che-mostat experiments ( Fig. 4A ) revealed that NarP protein acts to antagonize or spoil the ability of the NarL protein to activate gene-expression at intermediate nitrate levels ( i.e. , it functions as a negative regulator ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>The likely explanation for this is that most of the genes controlled by these promoters encode products that play a role in anaerobic-respiration of nitrate and nitrite , and thus their expression is fully induced only in both the absence of oxygen ( signalled via FNR ) and the presence of nitrate or nitrite ( signalled by NarL ) [ 4,29,30 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>This demonstrates that NarL has the major role in nitrate-induced repression of dcuB expression ( Fig. 5Dii ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9852003" target="_blank">9852003</a>]<br></li>
<li>For instance , the NarX protein , which functions to activate the regulator protein , NarL , in response to the presence of nitrate and molybdenum , contains the sequence SGRNE ( amino acid positions 204 to 208 ) ( 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8550508" target="_blank">8550508</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarX ( the narX gene product ) may be a sensor that modifies NarL in response to nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2649492" target="_blank">2649492</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarL apparently acts as a modul-ator for repression or activation of gene-expression in response to the action of the narR gene product ( a putative nitrate sensor ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2648330" target="_blank">2648330</a>]<br></li>
<li>WhereasFnrfunctionsasan anaerobic responsive sensor for the activation andrepression of gene-expression during anaerobiccell-growthconditions ( 2 , 7 , 8 ) , NarL functions as a nitrate - and molybdate-dependent response regulator of the NarX NarQ NarL two-component regulatory system ( 5 , 6 , 9-11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8419352" target="_blank">8419352</a>]<br></li>
<li>Either NarX or NarQ can transfer this signal to the cognate response regulator protein , NarL , which then binds DNA to regulate gene-expression in response to nitrate availability .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7730273" target="_blank">7730273</a>]<br></li>
<li>WhereasFnris requiredfor activation of narGHJI expression in response to anaerobiosis , NarL is essential for nitrate - and molybdate-dependent activation of n a r c ( 3 , 9 , 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8419352" target="_blank">8419352</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results show that the NarP protein activates F ( aeg-46 .5 - lacZ ) expression in response to nitrate and nitrite and that the NarL protein antagonizes this activation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>This shows that the NarL protein represses ` I ( aeg-93-lacZ ) expression in response to nitrate but activates expression in response to nitrite .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>These sensors then act to control the phosphorylation state of the regulators NarL and NarP ( Darwin & Stewart , 1996 ; Yamamoto et al. , 2005 ) , and there is a complex exchange of information between the sensors and the regulators to allow fine control of targetgene-expression in response to nitrate and nitrite .

<li>These two proteins belong to two operons , transcriptionally regulated by Fnr and NarL ( 23 , 46 ) , which subsequently were also found to be involved in regulation of aegA expression ( Table 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8955321" target="_blank">8955321</a>]<br></li>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8132465" target="_blank">8132465</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of nitrate and molybdate , NarL becomes an activator for the narGHJI operon encoding the nitrate reductase complex but a repressor for other operons such asfrdABCD , which encodes fumarate reductase ( 12 , 13 , 16 , 30 ) , the dms genes , which encode TMAO-dimethyl sulfoxide reductase ( 7 ) , or the adhE gene ( 16 ) .

<li>To pinpoint sequences necessary for this regulation , we scanned the pnrf sequence for possible NarL heptamer sequences , because it is possible that these are the targets for both NarL and NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>We suggest that both NarL and NarP recognize the same heptamer sequence , but that there is a set of degenerate sequences that , though still recognized by NarL , are bound very poorly by NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>

<li>Inspection of the DNA sequence in the NarL phosphate protected region revealed numerous ( at least ﬁve to seven ) NarL heptamer-like recognition sequences that are similar to the NarL heptamer sequence described by Darwin and coworkers ( 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>From these observations it seems likely that NarL stimulates transcription through an interaction with RNA polymerase which has already bound to the promoter by recognition of the sequence motifs which promote either aerobic or anaerobic transcription .

<li>Dependence of Nitrate Stimulation on a DNA Sequence and Its Location-To determine the positional specificity for the sequence required for the induction by nitrate and NarL , we synthesized a 35-bp fragment corresponding to 29 bp between positions -212 and -184 of the nar 5 ' - regulatory sequence plus a SalI linker at its 3 ' end ( Fig. 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3138237" target="_blank">3138237</a>]<br></li>
<li>A base sequence no longer than 27 bp , located at about -200 bp , was essentialfor the stimulation by nitrate coupled with NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3138237" target="_blank">3138237</a>]<br></li>
<li>Reconstitution of a functional promoter with the synthetic 35-bp fragment demonstrates that a 27-bp sequence from -210 to -184 is sufficient for the stimulation by nitrate coupled with NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3138237" target="_blank">3138237</a>]<br></li>
<li>One heptamer , centred at 242 ( heptamer 242 ) , matches the consensus ( indicated by underlining ) at five positions ( TAACGAT ) , and is in the middle of the FNR site ( centred at 242.5 ) , and thus is located in a similar position to a NarL heptamer ( centred at 250 ) , which overlaps the FNR site in the nrfA promoter ( Darwin et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18227264" target="_blank">18227264</a>]<br></li>
<li>This results from its dependence on FNR that binds to a site at position -41.5 , and NarL or NarP that bind to a 7-2-7 element centred at position -69.5 ( Fig. 10 ; Jayaraman et al. , 1989 ; Tyson et al. , 1993 ) .

<li>In addition , there is differential recognition of NarL/P heptamer patterning , such that NarL recognizes all TACYYMT heptamers , whereas NarP only binds these sequences when they are arranged as an inverted-repeat with a 2 bp spacing , the socalled 7-2-7 arrangement ( Darwin et al. , 1997 ) .

<li>Similarly , the targets for both NarL and NarP have been identiﬁed as two heptamer sequences organized as an inverted-repeat separated by 2 bp : this ` 7 -- 2 -- 7 ' NarL / NarP-binding sequence is located from positions ¹ 77 to ¹ 62 ( centred at ¹ 69.5 ) ( Tyson et al. , 1993 ; Darwin et al. , 1997 ) .

<li>As NarL is needed for optimal expression from pnir , we concluded that the inverted-repeat was the NarL-binding site and probably accommodated two NarL monomers : this was corroborated by the existence of similar sequences at other NarL-sensitive promoters ( Tyson etai .

<li>The first six lines of Fig. 4 show that the 10-base sequences upstream and downstream of this position are strikingly similar to the 10-base sequences at pnarG and pnirB , suggesting that two NarL subunits might bind to an inverted-repeat at the nirB and fdnGHI promoters , whilst , at pnarG , NarL binds to a direct repeat .

<li>Nitrite induction at hybrid nir/nrf promoters The sequences required for NarL-dependent nitrite induction of pnir and NarP/NarL-dependent nitrite induction of pnrf both consist of an inverted pair of NarL heptamers separated by two base pairs ( centred at -69 y2 and -74 ^ / 2 , at the nir and nrf promoters , respectively ; see Figs 1 and 3 ) .

<li>The NarP regulon overlaps the NarL regulon because both NarL and NarP can bind to a NarP site , which is a 7-2-7 inverted-repeat sequence where the seven conserved bases form the NarL heptamer [ 10 ] .

<li>A second potential NarL site , 59-TACCTCG-39 , is centered 148 bp upstream of the cydD translation start codon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9335308" target="_blank">9335308</a>]<br></li>
<li>Optimal expression from this promoter requires the action of two activator proteins , NarL and Fnr , The Fnr protein , which is an anaerobic responsive sensor , binds immediately 5 ' of the RNAP-binding site , whereas NarL , which is activated by the presence of nitrate , binds 200 bp upstream from the transcription start ( Fig. 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7651128" target="_blank">7651128</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of the FNR-dependent nitrate regulon is further activated by NarL binding to an upstream site , situated 70-200 bp upstream of the transcription start site , depending upon the promoter ( reviewed in Stewart , 1993 ) .

<li>DISCUSSION The activation of transcription of the nar operon by the two trans-acting factors , Fnr and NarL , involves sequences distributed over a 200-bp regionextending upstream from the transcription start site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3138237" target="_blank">3138237</a>]<br></li>
<li>The promoter region in plasmid pMW64 extends upstream 57 bp from the transcription start site and includes a functional Fnr box but not the NarL box region ( 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1735706" target="_blank">1735706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Plasmid pMW61 was constructed to contain the complete nar promoter extending 200 bp upstream from the transcription start site and including the NarL box region .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1735706" target="_blank">1735706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Stimulation of transcription by NarL and nitrate is dependent on a DNA sequence located approximately 200bp upstream from the transcription start site while Fnr-dependent transcription requires sequences which are located closer than -60 bp ( Li and DeMoss , 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2041473" target="_blank">2041473</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2160397" target="_blank">2160397</a>]<br></li>
<li>A sequence adjacent to anddownstream from -210 bp from the nar transcription start site , defined by pSL210 and pSL202 , is essential to the stimulation by NarL in the presence of nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3138237" target="_blank">3138237</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the presence of nitrate , NarL further stimulates anaerobic transcription from the narGHJI promoter through interaction with a cis-acting sequence ( NarL box ) located approximately 200 bp upstream from the transcription start site ( 12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1735706" target="_blank">1735706</a>]<br></li>
<li>he results presented here establish that a sequence immediately upstream from the presumed RNA polymerase binding site is required and sufficient for the response to activated Fnr while a sequence located more than 100 bp further upstream is required for response to NarL in thepresence of nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3138237" target="_blank">3138237</a>]<br></li>
<li>This located approximately 200 base pairs of sequence , upstream the transcription initiation site , is presumably the DNA target for NarL binding ( 27 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2649492" target="_blank">2649492</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nitrate regulation is mediated by a second , distinct protein called NarL , which has been proposed to be a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein whose recognition sequence is located some 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the narGHJI operon ( 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8376324" target="_blank">8376324</a>]<br></li>
<li>This was expected as the DNA site for NarL overlaps the acsP1 transcription start point .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15978080" target="_blank">15978080</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , β-galactosidase assays revealed that the 10-fold nitrate dependent repression of dmsA-lacZ expression was unaffected by the deletion of upstream DNA sequence to -71 relative to the start of dmsA transcription , further pinpointing the location of the 5 ' end of the NarL recognition site for dmsA ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12079504" target="_blank">12079504</a>]<br></li>
<li>As expected , when NarL or FNR was incubated with the pnir7150 fragment , single shifted complexes were detected ( Fig. 6A , lanes 1 -- 4 and 5 -- 7 ) , conﬁrming that each protein binds to a single site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15225315" target="_blank">15225315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Results in Fig. 2 show that FNR and NarL each protect 30 bp , consistent with binding of a dimer of each protein to a single target .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19251855" target="_blank">19251855</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the T which is at position 6 in both sites contains almost 1.6 times as much ` information ' for FNR as CAP , while the T at position 9 , although of little value to CAP , i a target for the NarL protein , a possibilitywe can now test by site-directed mutagenesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2677602" target="_blank">2677602</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarL protein binds to multiple sites in target operon control regions to regulate transcription ( 17 , 34 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>Deletions and mutations in the nir promoter upstream sequences The simplest model to account for the results in Fig. 2 is to suppose that one or more factors other than NarL and NarP bind to DNA elements upstream of the NsiI site at the nir promoter and can up or downregulate Fnr-depen-dent transcription activation , according to their precise location .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>
<li>Fnr binds to a single DNA site centred between basepairs 41 and 42 upstream from the nir transcript start , whereas NarL and NarP bind to a site upstream , centred between basepairs 69 and 70 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>
<li>To date , the nir operon promoter is the only case in which sequences far upstream of the DNA site for NarL and NarP have been shown to play a signiﬁcant role , and in which this site is centred at position ¹ 69.5 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>
<li>The Figure shows the base sequence from position − 125 to position + 98 with respect to the reported transcript start , and the previously proposed DNA sites for NarL and NarP , FNR and NsrR [ 9 -- 11 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20533909" target="_blank">20533909</a>]<br></li>
<li>Consistent with this , comparison of the promoter sequence in several related bacteria show that core elements , including the DNA sites for FNR and NsrR , are better conserved than the upstream ﬂanking sequences that contain the DNA site for NarL and NarP ( Figure 8 ) .

<li>As at the yeaR promoter , nitrate-dependent induction can be repressed by Fis that binds to a single site overlapping the upstream DNA site for NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results ( Figure 2B ) reveal that Fis binds to a target ( Fis I ) that overlaps the upstream end of the DNA site for NarL and , at higher Fis concentrations , a second site ( Fis II ) , which overlaps the downstream end of the DNA site for NarL , is occupied .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results , illustrated in Figure 5 ( B ) , identify a target for Fis that overlaps the upstream site for NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>

<li>The EMSA experiment , illustrated in Figure 1 ( C ) , shows that NarL causes a single clear shifted band , consistent with NarL binding a single target site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ogt102 fragment carries substitutions at positions − 84 and − 73 , which disrupt the NarL I binding site , and the ogt104 fragment carries substitutions at positions − 51 and − 40 , which disrupt the NarL II binding site ( Figure 4A ) .

<li>We conclude that efficient nitrate induction of nar operon expression requires an IHF-mediated bend in the control region to properly position NarL , bound at the position -195 region , with respect to the transcription initiation site .

<li>Previously , we demonstrated that NarL activates FNR-dependent transcription at pnrf by displacing IHF bound to the IHF I site ( 3 , 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16936015" target="_blank">16936015</a>]<br></li>
<li>It seems conceivable that activated NarL , bound at about -200 bp , interacts with the transcription machinery at the -10 and -35 region through alinear array of proteins , i.e. the factor bound at -200 bp promotes the binding of another protein to adjacent sequences , which in turn facilitates the binding of another one next to it until thperocess reaches th Fnr binding site .

<li>Alternatively , NarL bound at about -200 bp could directly interact with the Fnrcomplex next to the -35 region or with another NarLcomplex next to the Fn binding site , resulting in the formation of a DNAloop .

<li>In previous work ( 3 -- 6 ) , we showed that the DNA target for FNR at pnrf is centered at position 41.5 ( i.e. , between 41 and 42 bp upstream from the transcript start point ) , that anaerobically induced FNR-dependent activation of pnrf is downregulated by the binding of the nucleoid-associated protein IHF to a target ( IHF I ) centered at position 54 , and that this repression is relieved by the binding of either NarL or NarP to a DNA target centered at position 74.5 ( Fig. 1 ) .

<li>It is well established that narK and narGHJI are organized as two operons transcribed in the same orientation , but with 500 bp of intergenic DNA that includes a rho-independent narK transcription terminator , and binding sites for regulation by the oxygen-responsive transcription factor , FNR , and the nitrate -- nitrite-responsive two-component regulatory system , NarX -- NarL ( Stewart & Parales , 1988 ; Kolesnikow et al. , 1992 ) .

<li>This is consistent with the known DNA binding properties of NarP ( recognizes 7-2-7 sites ) and NarL ( recognizes both 7-2-7 sites and isolated heptamers ) ( Darwin et al. , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18227264" target="_blank">18227264</a>]<br></li>
<li>) , NarL-Phosphate binds to and protects two extended regions ( - 8 0 to - 1 2 0 and - 1 8 0 to -215 ) which contain hexameric sequences defined as specific NarL binding sequences ( Dong et al. 1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7747940" target="_blank">7747940</a>]<br></li>
<li>This intergenic region contains sites for NarL , IHF and Fnr ( Spiro and Guest , 1990 ; Walker and DeMoss , 1991 ; Dong et al. , 1992 ; Rabin et al. , 1992 ; Schroder et al. , 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10564515" target="_blank">10564515</a>]<br></li>
<li>These include an IHF binding region extending from - 1 0 6 to - 1 4 4 ( Rabin et al. 1992 ; Schr6der et al. 1993 ) and two NarL binding sites located on either side of the IHF binding site .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7747940" target="_blank">7747940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , for activation of transcription to occur , the sequences which define the IHF and NarL binding sites must be correctly positioned relative to each other and to the downstream region where RNA polymerase binds ( Dong et al. 1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7747940" target="_blank">7747940</a>]<br></li>
<li>An EMSA experiment showed that NarL binds to at least two sites at the ogt promoter ( Figure 4C ) and DNase I footprinting ( Figure 4D ) revealed two binding targets for NarL that appear to correspond to two 7-2-7 sites , centred at position − 78.5 ( NarL I ) − and 45.5 ( NarL II ) ( highlighted in Figure 4A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>The intervening sequence between the upstream NarL binding region and the downstream Fnr box of narK can be substituted by the corresponding fragment from narGHJI and vice-versa without affecting the regulation pattern ( Bonnefoy et DeMoss unpubl .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7747940" target="_blank">7747940</a>]<br></li>
<li>The centres of the two NarL boxes , spaced 96 bp ( or approximately nine integral helical turns ) apart , would present binding sites on the same face of the DNA and could permit interaction between the bound NarL subunits .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1474901" target="_blank">1474901</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thusitappears that IHF can bind to quite different recognition sites with high affinity.The narG ' IHFbindingsite , which is centered -125 bp upstream of the narG transcription start ( 32 ) , is located in between the proposed binding sites for the two other essential regulatory proteins , NarL and Fnr ( 12 , 32 ) .

<li>The Y untranslated region of the harK gene contains two Fnr boxes ( centred at position -41.5 and -79.5 ) and two NarL binding sites ( centred at position -98.5 and - 199.5 ) ( Bonnefoy & DeMoss 1992 ) .

<li>Conversely , synthesis of the NADH-dependent nitrite reductase , NirBD , is induced by both nitrate and nitrite ; transcription of the nir operon is equally activated by both NarL and by NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16377617" target="_blank">16377617</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nitrite and nitrate regulation of nir and nrf operon expression is mediated by the NarL and NarP proteins ( Tyson et al. 1993 , 1994 ) : whilst transcription from the nir promoter is induced by both nitrite and nitrate , transcription of the nrf operon is induced by nitrite but repressed by nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9382703" target="_blank">9382703</a>]<br></li>
<li>the FNR-dependent nrf operon is induced during anaerobic growth by nitrite but is repressed by NarL in the presence of nitrate [ 11,19 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10548535" target="_blank">10548535</a>]<br></li>
<li>Enzymes implicated in NO production in the E. coli cytoplasm The NarL-activated narGHJI operon is strongly induced during anaerobic growth in the presence of high concentrations of nitrate , whereas the nrf operon is repressed by nitrate-activated NarL , but induced by nitrite - or nitrateactivated NarP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22092912" target="_blank">22092912</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription is also induced by NarL and NarP in response to nitrite , but is repressed by NarL in the presence of nitrate [ 11,18 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10548535" target="_blank">10548535</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription initiation at the nrfA promoter is activated by FNR in the absence of oxygen and induced further by NarL and NarP in response to low concentrations of nitrate or to nitrite ( 35 , 44 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17449618" target="_blank">17449618</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the nitrate reductase genes narGHJI are regulated exclusively by NarL and are not responsive to NarP as observed here for cydD , while nitrate induction of the fdnGHI operon is regulated predominantly by NarL but is also responsive in part to NarP ( 33 , 39 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9335308" target="_blank">9335308</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similar differences were observed in the regulation by nitrate of genes for hydrogenase synthesis : the hyaABCDEF and hyc ¬ ABCDEFGH operons were repressed by both NarL and NarP ; the hyb operon was repressed only by NarL ( Figures 1C and 1D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16417494" target="_blank">16417494</a>]<br></li>
<li>Among these operons , the napF operon , encoding a periplasmic nitrate reductase , has unique features with respect to its Fnr - , NarL - , and NarP-dependent regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression from a monocopy ( dcuS-lacZ ) operon fusion revealed three - to fourfold repression by nitrate ( Table 2 ) , virtually all of which can be attributed to the NarX-NarL regulatory system rather than the paralogous NarQ-NarP system ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15995204" target="_blank">15995204</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like the dmsABC operon , these operons are regulated in response to nitrate availability , in a molybdate-dependent manner , by the NarQ/NarX/NarL / NarP two-component system ( reviewed in Gunsalus , 1992 ) .

<li>g001 in denitrifying and ammonifying c-proteobacteria , the nitrate / nitrite signal is processed by the two-component sensorregulator NarX-NarL and its paralog NarQ-NarP in E. coli that control the respiratory nitrate reductase operon nar and the nitrite ammonifying loci nir and nrf [ 19 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16261196" target="_blank">16261196</a>]<br></li>
<li>A difference in these models is that high levels of NarL-phosphate are postulated to repress aeg-93 ( ntf ) operon expression , while the NarL protein does not repress fdnG operon expression under any conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8501030" target="_blank">8501030</a>]<br></li>
<li>This induction was more pronounced in the narL null strains , reﬂecting the antagonistic role for the phospho-NarL protein in controlling napF operon expression ( 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=13129959" target="_blank">13129959</a>]<br></li>
<li>This implies that the NarL protein does not require Fnr for its action on adhE expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8423158" target="_blank">8423158</a>]<br></li>
<li>This operon was initially identiﬁed by Choe and Reznikoff as an anonymous anaerobically expressed gene at map coordinate 46.5 ( aeg-46 .5 locus ) , whose expression is activated by the Fnr protein and inhibited by the NarL protein ( 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=13129959" target="_blank">13129959</a>]<br></li>
<li>A model whereby three transcriptional activators , NarL , IHF , and Fnr , induce expression of a a70-dependent promoter for the narGHJI operon is discussed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8419352" target="_blank">8419352</a>]<br></li>
<li>Genetic regulation chiC locus narGHIJ operon hark gene Like the narGHJl operon , expression of the narK gene is positively regulated by Fnr , NarL and IHF ( Stewart & Parales 1988 ; Kolesnikow et al. 1992 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7747940" target="_blank">7747940</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is important to note that the presence of functional NarL is not sufficient for narGHJI expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8412675" target="_blank">8412675</a>]<br></li>
<li>More directly , with the -13 change in the complete promoter ( plasmid pMV61 , Table 1 ) , nitrate induced the same relative increases in aerobic and anaerobic expression as it did with the wild-type promoter ( data not shown ) , arguing against any change in the mechanism of regulation by NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1735706" target="_blank">1735706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Location of NarL binding sites at the dmsA promoter Under anaerobic conditions , dmsA expression is repressed approximately 10-fold by NarL when nitrate is present [ 4 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12079504" target="_blank">12079504</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , with the pMW61 derivative ( pMW617 ) aerobic expression was stimulated 20-fold by nitrate , confirming that the stimulation of transcription by NarL occurs in the absence of a functional Fnr box under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1735706" target="_blank">1735706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Effects of NarL-binding-site mutations in a narL background Although NarL was originally characterized as a factor essential for nitrate-induction of gene expression , disruption of narL does not completely stop nitrate induction of pnirB ( Page et ai .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , narX and narQ gene products appear to each activate NarL when nitrate is present but not to the same degrees .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1429433" target="_blank">1429433</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nitrate-dependent repression of fdhF-lacZ expression shown in Fig. 3B was conﬁrmed by batch culture experiments in which NarL negatively regulated gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rather , NarL and nitrate clearly provide the major inputs in controlling of nrfA gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the corresponding change , narL503 ( H15L ) , did not lead to constitutive activation and repression by NarL , but rather abolished its ability to regulate gene expression in response to nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2066339" target="_blank">2066339</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is known that RNS are generated during anaerobic respiration of nitrate and nitrite [ 38 -- 40 ] , and hence it is easy to envisage that the yeaR-yoaG operon helps manage some aspect of RNS stress , after its expression is co-induced by external nitrate or nitrite ions ( sensed by NarL ) and RNS ( sensed by NsrR ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nar and fdn operons are coregulated by Fnr and NarL , yet The narK control region appears to have the same general architecture as the narGHJI control region ( 40 ) , and him mutations similarly abolished nitrate induction of ( D ( narKlacZ ) expression ( data not shown ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1528882" target="_blank">1528882</a>]<br></li>
<li>Second , NarL can repress nrfA-lacZ expression when nitrate is present , whereas NarP can not ( compare the NarL1 NarP2 strain to the NarL2 NarP1 strain and to the wild-type strain ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of dcuC * 9-9lacZ was increased by a factor of about 2.2 compared to that in the wild type , but the responses to oxygen , nitrate , and the regulators FNR , NarL , and NarP were comparable to those in the wild type ( data not shown ) .

<li>Transcription activation ofthenitratereductase structural gene operon ( narGHJI ) requires the FNR protein for induction by anaerobiosis and the NarL proteinforinduction by nitrate ( STEWART1982 ) .

<li>Common mechanismsfor regulatingfdnGHZ and narGHJZ expression : Previous work has shown that narGHJI operon expression requires FNR for induction by anaerobiosis , and NarL for induction by nitrate ( STEWART1982 ; LI and DEMOS 1988 ; reviewed by STEWART 1988 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2168848" target="_blank">2168848</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ﬁrst protein , NarL ( 8 ) , represses adhE expression , but this occurs only in the presence of nitrate ( 5 , 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10601216" target="_blank">10601216</a>]<br></li>
<li>As additional NarL protein is activated in the presence of higher levels of nitrate ( ca. 7 mM ) , it fully displaces the NarP phosphate from the DNA and maximally induces fdnG expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nitrate induction of narXL operon expression , coupled with the varying sensitivities of the narG , fdnG , and frdA control regions to the availability of phospho-NarL , might aid in establishing these priorities in the correct order .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>At elevated-nitrate conditions , additional NarL molecules bind to the ﬂanking NarL heptamer sites at 250 and 222 to repress nrfA operon expression ( Fig. 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>During growth with nitrate , phospho-NarL protein ( but not phospho-NarP protein ) binds also to lower-afﬁnity heptamers at positions 50 and 22 ( Fig. 1 ) to repress nrfA operon expression ( 7 , 34 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12644479" target="_blank">12644479</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarL and NarP proteins were required for full nitrate induction of narXL operon expression , whereas the nitrate repression of narP and narQ expression was mediated solely by the NarL protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>The nitrate repression ofpfl expression mediated by NarL is only minor relative to the repression exhibited on the fumarate reductase operon ( 11 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3053657" target="_blank">3053657</a>]<br></li>
<li>One possible explanation for the enhanced nitrate-dependent repression of hya gene expression in the narP mutant is that normally NarL and NarP compete to repress hyb operon expression , with NarP binding being favoured .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>
<li>In the case of hya operon regulation , both NarL and NarP appear to be equally effective at repressing expression in the presence of nitrate ( see Table 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10537212" target="_blank">10537212</a>]<br></li>
<li>Most of the nitrate and nitrite induction of the fdnG operon is mediated by NarL , although NarP can weakly induce expression ( 23 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of the nirB operon differs from nrfA in that NarL and NarP are reported to activate nirB expression in response to nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>
<li>NarP thus performs a unique role to ﬁne-tune fdnG operon expression by delaying the ability of NarL to activate when nitrate levels are low .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Overall expression of the narXL genes was only slightly reduced in the absence of IHF ( Table 3 ) , suggesting that limitation for NarL and/or NarX is not responsible for the severe deficiency in nar operon induction by nitrate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1528882" target="_blank">1528882</a>]<br></li>
<li>( i ) When nitrate was present , NarL , the positive regulator of the nar operon , exerted a direct repression on adhE expression , which was demonstrable even aerobically .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1744060" target="_blank">1744060</a>]<br></li>
<li>When the complete 5 ' region of the nar operon including the NarL box was present , nitrate stimulated both aerobic and anaerobic expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1735706" target="_blank">1735706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Aerobic expression was independent of ArcA and Fnr , but induction of cydDC by nitrate and nitrite was dependent on NarL and Fnr .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9335308" target="_blank">9335308</a>]<br></li>
<li>The anaerobic expression of the nar operon depends on the fnr gene product ( Fnr ) , and the stimulationof anaerobicexpression by nitrate requires narL the gene product ( NarL ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3138237" target="_blank">3138237</a>]<br></li>
<li>Neither Fnr nor NarL boxes can be detected in the promoter region , corroborating the Fnr-independent anaerobic expression of the tor operon , as well as the absence of repression by nitrate ( Pascal et ai .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8022286" target="_blank">8022286</a>]<br></li>
<li>Second , the degree of nitrate repression of pfl operon expression is not mediated by Fnr but probably by another transcriptional activator , NarL ( 51 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2651404" target="_blank">2651404</a>]<br></li>
<li>From the work of Stewart and Berg ( 1988 ) it is clear that the NarL protein does not mediate the nitrate repression of fdhF and hyd-J 7 transcription as it does with fumarate reductase operon expression ( luchi and Lin , 1987 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2181234" target="_blank">2181234</a>]<br></li>
<li>DISCUSSION We have established that IHF is essentifaolr the anaerobic expression of the nitrate reductase ( narGHJZ ) operon of E. coli by the Fnr and NarL activator proteA inpsa.rtial deletion of the h i d gene , which encodes the a subunit of the heter-odimeric IHF protein ( 30 ) d , ecreased narG-lac2 expression in cells grown anaerobically , and it alssoeverely impaired nitrate induction of narG expression by NarL ( Table I ) .

<li>For plasmids pSL186 , pSL170 , pSL156 , pSL111 , pSL90 , pSL75 , and pSL64 , which had lost the upstream sequence necessary for nitratestimulation , the anaerobic expression with or without nitrate was comparable in both ES2002 and MC4100 ( lac narL + ) , suggesting that the expression was not dependent on NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3138237" target="_blank">3138237</a>]<br></li>
<li>To examine the roles of NarL and NarP at pnir , the EcoRI-H/ndlll fragment was cloned into the low-copy-number iac expression vector pRW50 , such that iac expression was controlled by pnir The resulting recombinant , pKT1 , was transferred to different genetic backgrounds and iac expression was rrieasured during growth in different conditions ( Table 1 ) , In the narL * narP * background , pnir expression was induced in anaerobic conditions and was further increased in the presence of nitrate or nitrite .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7854119" target="_blank">7854119</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conclude that any second factor is likely to bind to sequences similar to NarL , Note that the single and double mutations also reduce the FNR-dependent pnirB expression during anaerobic growth in the absence of externally added nitrite or nitrate , suggesting that both NarL and the second factor are needed for optimal anaerobically induced FNR-dependent transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8437517" target="_blank">8437517</a>]<br></li>
<li>The likely explanation for this is that most of the genes controlled by these promoters encode products that play a role in anaerobic respiration of nitrate and nitrite , and thus their expression is fully induced only in both the absence of oxygen ( signalled via FNR ) and the presence of nitrate or nitrite ( signalled by NarL ) [ 4,29,30 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , β-galactosidase assays revealed that the 10-fold nitrate dependent repression of dmsA-lacZ expression was unaffected by the deletion of upstream DNA sequence to -71 relative to the start of dmsA transcription , further pinpointing the location of the 5 ' end of the NarL recognition site for dmsA ( data not shown ) .

<li>While NarL was still able to activate and to repress nrfA gene expression , the pattern differed from the wild-type nrfA-lacZ reporter fusion ( Fig. 6B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11004182" target="_blank">11004182</a>]<br></li>

<li>We did not examine the regulation of fxsA gene expression , although conceivably it could be regulated by the NarL , Fnr , and Crp binding sites that control aspA transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15995204" target="_blank">15995204</a>]<br></li>

<li>Revised model for NarL and NarP control of fdhF gene expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12923080" target="_blank">12923080</a>]<br></li></div>
<li>Another example is the NarL / NarP - and FNR-stimulated expression of nirB and nrf genes , which are repressed by Fis and IHF ( Browning et al. , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15066032" target="_blank">15066032</a>]<br></li>
<li>Analysis of the ogt promoter A previous transcriptome analysis had predicted that expression of the ogt gene is also activated by NarL independently of FNR [ 11 ] .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19245365" target="_blank">19245365</a>]<br></li>
<li>FNR and NarL expression is decreased significantly in the rimO mutant .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21169565" target="_blank">21169565</a>]<br></li>
<li>The absence of Fnr and NarL consensus sequences ( 15 , 33 ) upstream of torR is consistent with the lack of regulation of the torCAD operon by these two proteins ( 24 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8083154" target="_blank">8083154</a>]<br></li>
<li>These two proteins belong to two operons , transcriptionally regulated by Fnr and NarL ( 23 , 46 ) , which subsequently were also found to be involved in regulation of aegA expression ( Table 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8955321" target="_blank">8955321</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , it appeared that the same was not true for Fnr ( D154A ) and MBP-NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>It appeared that the in vitro napF transcription start site in the presence of either RNA polymerase alone or Fnr ( D154A ) was approximately three nucleotides upstream relative to the site in the presence of MBP-NarL or MBP-NarP ( Fig. 3 and 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results conﬁrm that MBP-NarL decreases MBP-NarP - and Fnr ( D154A ) - depen-dent transcription of napF in vitro .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>Antagonization of MBP-NarP - and Fnr ( D154A ) - dependent napF transcription by MBP-NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>Target operon transcription is activated by the Fnr protein in response to anaerobiosis , and it is further activated and/or repressed by the phosphoNarL and phospho-NarP proteins , which bind to heptamer DNA sequences .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12644479" target="_blank">12644479</a>]<br></li>
<li>For the nirBDC and nrfABCDEFG operons , Fnr protein , bound near position 41.5 , activates transcription maximally only when phospho-NarL or - NarP protein is bound further upstream to block inhibition by other proteins ( 2 , 8 , 59 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17720788" target="_blank">17720788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Phospho-NarL and - NarP activate transcription of the narG and napF operons , respectively , whereas phospho-NarL antagonizes napF operon transcription ( 18 , 22 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19060147" target="_blank">19060147</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is quite likely that NarL and/or NarP can activate transcription directly when bound at other locations ( such as at position ¹ 74.5 at the nrf operon promoter and at position ¹ 44.5 at the nap -- ccm operon promoter ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9484902" target="_blank">9484902</a>]<br></li>
<li>Results indicate that the downstream promoter ( P1 ) was responsible for Fnr - and NarP-regulated napF operon expression , whereas transcription from the upstream promoter ( P2 ) was activated only weakly by the Fnr protein and was inhibited by phospho-NarP and - NarL proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=13129959" target="_blank">13129959</a>]<br></li>
<li>The results support our hypothesis ( 9 ) that the Fnr and NarP proteins act together to cause maximum napF operon expression whereas the Fnr and NarL proteins do not .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarL protein does not signiﬁcantly activate napF operon expression in the presence of Fnr , whereas the NarP protein does .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>The NarL protein binds to sites close to the transcription initiation site to repress expression of the frdABCD operon .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7601854" target="_blank">7601854</a>]<br></li>
<li>The transcription factors NarL and NarP are not essential for flrd expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12586421" target="_blank">12586421</a>]<br></li>
<li>The inability of NarL to activate napF operon expression led us to hypothesize that NarL is deﬁcient in the mechanism by which NarP activates transcription from the 244.5 binding site ( 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>By contrast , the napF operon Fnr site is centered at 64.5 and the NarP-NarL site is located downstream , centered at position 44.5 ( Fig. 1 ) ( 7 , 9 , 10 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=13129959" target="_blank">13129959</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription from the Haemophilus inﬂuenzae napF ( napFHi ) operon control region is activated by Fnr and phos-pho-NarP or phospho-NarL in E. coli ( 65 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19060147" target="_blank">19060147</a>]<br></li>
<li>The napF operon control region is the one exception to these generali-zations about NarL - and NarP-dependent regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>The napF operon provides the only known example of a promoter activated by NarP but not NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9696769" target="_blank">9696769</a>]<br></li>
<li>This suggests that phospho-NarL may repress frdA operon expression indirectly by repressing synthesis of the DcuS-DcuR activator of frdA operon transcription initiation in addition to directly repressing transcription from the frdA promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15995204" target="_blank">15995204</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regulated yeaR-yoaG operon expression required no more than 62 nt upstream of the transcription initiation site , which included the phylogenetically conserved regulatory elements : a site for binding phospho-NarL and - NarP activators and an overlapping site for binding the NsrR repressor ( Fig. 1A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17720788" target="_blank">17720788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression of narK , like that of narGHJI , is positively regulated by Fnr and NarL ( Stewart and Parales , 1988 ) and examination of the putative narK promoter region ( Noji etai , 1989 ) reveals several interesting features .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1474901" target="_blank">1474901</a>]<br></li>
<li>Expression from the Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 nnrS gene promoter , cloned into E. coli , similarly was activated by phospho-NarL protein independent of the Fnr protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17720788" target="_blank">17720788</a>]<br></li>
<li>Resi-dues 593 , 596 , 597 , and 600 affected transcription stimulation by Fnr at the narG promoter but only in the absence of the activator P-NarL .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10572130" target="_blank">10572130</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activated NarL in conjunction with Fnr then activates transcription of the narK and narC operons , but represses transcription of other operons such as frd and tor .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2657652" target="_blank">2657652</a>]<br></li>

<li>Putative Fnr and NarL boxes ( Fnrl and NarL2 , Fig. 1 ) , identical to those in the narGHJI operon , are separated by a similar length of apparently unrelated sequence .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1474901" target="_blank">1474901</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activation of the Esche-richia coli nitrate reductase ( narGHJI ) operon by NarL and Fnr requires integration host factor .
