[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17480116" target="_blank">17480116</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , our data suggest that Rob mediates the regulation of the multidrug efﬂux pump AcrAB by some of the most important environmental signals , including bile salts ( which are probably the ` natural ' substrates of AcrAB ; Zgurskaya and Nikaido , 1999 ) and free fatty acids ( which are abundant in the intestinal tract ; see Introduction ) , and apparently helps the survival of E. coli in its natural habitat by making it more resistant to lipophilic inhibitors , presumably including bile salts .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Induction of Rob is not needed for induction of AcrAB , and we suggest that the inducers act by producing conformational alterations in pre-existing Rob , as was suggested recently ( Rosner , Dangi , Gronenborn and Martin , J Bacteriol 184 : 1407 -- 1416 , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>( c ) EMSAs showing the effect on binding fumC DNA of increasing concentrations ( 0 , 8 , 80 , and 800 nM ) of wild-type Rob and PCmutants K30A , L74A , D75A , and L78A were carried out as described in Materials and Methods .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>All 12 DNA-binding proteins , CbpA , CbpB ( or Rob ) , DnaA , Dps , Fis , Hfq , H-NS , HU , IciA , IHF , Lrp and StpA , were over-expressed using pCU60 , pMK19 , pSY567 , pDPS1 , pRJ1077 , pHFQ607 , pHOP11 , pLhupAhupB , pICS1 , pSA5hiphimA , pMWD1 and pT7stpA , respectively , and puri ® ed to apparent homogeneity as previously described ( Talukder & Ishihama 1999 ) .

<li>Table 1 shows clearly that , in GC4468 , which produces Rob , both decanoate and chenodeoxycholate made the cells more resistant to novobiocin , chloramphenicol and tetracycline , but this effect did not occur in an isogenic rob mutant of GC4468 , HN1048 .

<li>Additionally , although induction of chromosomal marA in wild-type cells by sodium salicylate caused a clear upregulation of nfnB expression , identical concentrations of 2,2 cents - dipyridyl ( 5 mM ) , recently reported as an inducer of the chromosomal Rob ( Rosner et al. , 2002 ) , failed to demonstrate such an effect .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>marA and soxS expression can be increased by treating cells with-salicylate ( Cohen et al. , 1993 ) and paraquat ( Demple , 1996 ) , respectively , and the activity of Rob can be increased post-translationally by treatment with 2,2 ′ - dipyridyl ( DIP ) , bile salts or decanoate ( Rosner et al. , 2002 ; Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rob was shown to-bind next to the rightmost binding sites for the replication initiator protein , DnaA ( Skarstad et al. 1993 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7476863" target="_blank">7476863</a>]<br></li>
<li>During the course of this study , Rosner et al. ( 2002 ) showed that dipyridyl binds to Rob and thus presumably activates this protein .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>While this study was in progress , Rosner et al. ( 2002 ) showed that 2,2 cents - dipyridyl , which increases the Robdependent transcription of inaA , binds to the CTD of Rob , and came to the same conclusion that Rob exerts its action by binding to the effector .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recently , it was reported that acrAB is also induced by bile salts and fatty acids via the Rob system ( Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15686558" target="_blank">15686558</a>]<br></li>
<li>Blackwell Science , LtdOxford , UKMMIMolecular Microbiology1365-2958Blackwell Publishing Ltd , 200348616091619Original ArticleBinding of bile salts to Rob regulates AcrAb expressionE.Y.Rosenberg et al. .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>We show here that the induction of the AcrAB efﬂux pump by decanoate and the more lipophilic unconjugated bile salts is mediated by Rob , and that the low-molecular-weight inducers speciﬁcally bind to the C-terminal , non-DNA-binding domain of Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Binding of potential effector ligands to Rob protein Because Rob contains a large C-terminal domain not involved in DNA binding ( Kwon et al. , 2000 ) , it is possible that this domain senses the presence of low-molecular-weight effectors such as bile salts and decanoate .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this study , we show that the induction of the acrAB operon by bile salts and fatty acids involves the binding of these effectors to pre-existing Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results leave no doubt that AcrAB induction by fatty acids and lipophilic bile salts is mediated by the Rob protein and occurs with ecologically expected concentrations of these compounds .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rob increases antibiotic and organic solvent tolerance through induction of the mar operon ( 20 ) and is posttranscriptionally activated by such host physiological substances as bile salts ( 42 ) and antimicrobial peptides ( 50 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>Finally , the MIC of lipophilic antibiotics was increased in the presence of physiological concentrations ding of bile salts to Rob regulates AcrAb expression 1615 of decanoate and chenodeoxycholate in a rob + parent strain , but it either stayed the same , or even decreased , under these conditions in an isogenic rob : : kan mutant strain ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , studies demonstrate that Rob induced by decanoate or bile salts results in the increased expression of acrAB in the absence of both the mar and sox loci ( 12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16478729" target="_blank">16478729</a>]<br></li>
<li>As the glyco and tauro series of conjugated bile acids have pKa values in the range of 4.4 and 1.4 , respectively , in contrast to 6.4 of unconjugated bile acids , the lack of blue shift activity may indicate that only the protonated species bind to the CTD of Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>In any case , in this study we further show that the level of Rob in cells is enhanced at the stationary phase and under certain growth conditions such as glucose - and phosphate-starvation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7476863" target="_blank">7476863</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rob or CTD-deleted Rob was dissolved in 10 mM K-phosphate buffer , pH 6.8 , and putative effectors were added at the concentrations indicated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Interestingly , the correlation of in vitro and intact cell activities seems to be less than perfect in the case of glycochenodeoxycholate , which is only a moderate inducer ( Fig. 2 ) but apparently binds to Rob CTD strongly ( Fig. 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>In any case , the general correlation between the blue shift effect and the inducer activity leads us to believe that the blue shift is measuring the signiﬁcant interaction between the CTD of Rob and these effectors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>By analogy to the two-stage regulation of the superoxide and multiple anti-biotic resistance regulons , Rob level or activity may be regulated by the divergently transcribed creABCD operon ( formerly known as the phoM operon ) , whose normal cellular function is unknown ( 35 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>This concentration of IPTG resulted consistently in a 1.5-fold increase in b-galactosidase activity from the inaA1 : : lacZ fusion ( Fig. 1C ) and was used for screening for MudJ insertions responsive to Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rob repression of this fusion in the Drob / pMB101 background was 2.3-fold ( Table 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>Furthermore , the induc-ibility of the transcriptional lacZ fusions in response to Rob induction in the Drob/pMB101 background was reduced : induction levels of the inaA , aslB , ybaO , mdlA , and yfhD fusions were , respectively , 2 - , 7 - , 2.5 - , 1.5 - , and 2-fold lower in M9 medium than in LB broth ( Table 3 versus Table 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our in vitro data on the puriﬁed Rob indeed suggested the binding of our effectors to this protein , as judged on the basis of changes in intrinsic ﬂuorescence emission spectra of Rob ( Figs 5 and 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>( ii ) Under in vitro conditions , which may not faithfully reproduce those in the cytoplasm , the puriﬁed Rob may become ` activated ' to the state that would require the binding of effectors in intact cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>The bound ligand could induce Rob 's acidic loop to curl away from the DNA binding surface , adopting a conformation similar to that of the analogous loop of GalT in complex with UDP-galactose ( Fig. 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10802742" target="_blank">10802742</a>]<br></li>
<li>Decanoate induces the acrAB operon even when the rob gene is under lac promoter control The binding of inducers to Rob protein , but not to the CTD-truncated Rob , suggests strongly that they function by altering the activity of pre-existing Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>The precise mechanism whereby the binding of effectors affects the activity of Rob is still unclear .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it is tempting to speculate that the C-terminal region of Rob is involved in binding an effector-molecule that regulates Rob activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>

<li>To analyse activation of tolC by Rob , a different approach was used as in vivo Rob protein has to be post-translationally activated for it to be a potent transcriptional-activator ( Rosner et al. , 2002 ; Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>

<li>Thus , according to these arguments , it should be possible to determine the degree of coincidence between the zwf soxbox and the DNA binding / transcriptional activation sites of MarA , TetD , and Rob by testing whether the overproduction of the respective proteins elevates b-galactosidase expression in vivo from our set of zwf-lacZ and zwf-gnd-lacZ fusions .

<li>In the presence of wild-type mar , it is difﬁcult to estimate the transcriptional activation by Rob on a mar : : lacZ fusion due to Rob 's activation of the chromosomal locus , resulting in marR expression and the repression of mar. .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>This result suggested that the elevated activity of the wildtype promoter in the mar strains might result from activation by some other transcriptional-activator , possibly the structur-ally related Rob protein .

<li>Thus , basal levels of MarA and Rob and induced levels of SoxS independently contribute to transcriptional activation of mar and require a functional marbox for activity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , activation by Fis is dependent on the presence of MarA or Rob ( or induced levels of SoxS ; see below ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>

<li>Moreover , these ﬁndings raise the question of whether the effect of other MDR regulators , such as AcrR , a repressor of acrA , or the MarAhomologs SoxS and Rob , as well as marA orthologs or marAlike regulators in other clinically relevant pathogens , are also subject to this kind of ﬁne-tuned regulation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20211899" target="_blank">20211899</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , Rob , SoxS , and MarA function as monomers ,18 bind the same but highly degenerate target sequences,18-23 and activate transcription of a common set of ~ 100 genes,16,24-28 by the same , novel prerecruitment/DNA scanning mechanism,11,29-31 although each paralog differentially activates transcription of the target genes .16,32,33 Rob differs from its paralogs in several ways : it is synthesized constitutively34 ,35 rather than in response to an inducing signal , as are SoxS36 and MarA ,37,38 and it contains a CTD .35,39 The CTD is both necessary and sufficient for sequestration -- dispersal ,40 the novel mechanism for turning off and turning on Rob 's ability to function as a transcription activator in the presence or absence , respectively , of an inducing signal , for example , bile salts .37 In addition , the co-crystal structure of Rob bound to the robbox in the micF promoter39 differs significantly from the co-crystal structure of MarA bound to the marbox in the mar promoter .41 ( We note that even though the binding sites for MarA , Rob , and SoxS are the same in a given promoter , the site is given the name of the protein bound there in a specific situation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>In turn , this indicates that Rob and MarA do not bind DNA differently and that in vivo Rob 's CTD does not cause it to-bind robbox DNA differently than MarA binds marbox DNA in vitro41 or than SoxS binds soxbox DNA in vivo .42 We also note that the in vitro binding of Rob , SoxS , and MarA to a robbox/soxbox/marbox bends the DNA by about 30 ° ; 50 however , although mar DNA is bent by about 35 ° in the co-crystal structure with MarA ,41 the micF DNA is straight in the co-crystal structure with Rob .39 In addition , the boundaries of the regions protected from DNase I digestion by the binding of purified Rob or MalE -- SoxS to DNA containing the zwf and fumC promoters were the same ; 50 this would not be the case unless Rob 's C-terminal HTH motif was bound to RE2 of these promoters , as occurs with MalE -- SoxS .51 Together , these data suggest that the absence of DNA binding by helix-6 and the linearity of DNA in the Rob -- micF co-crystal structure do not accurately represent the DNA binding properties of Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , recognition helix-3 and helix-6 of MarA 's dual HTH motifs bind RE1 and RE2 , respectively , of mar 's robbox , while helix-3 within Rob 's N-terminal HTH motif binds RE1 of micF 's robbox , but helix-6 does not bind RE2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the data in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c not only show that in vivo Rob binds to robbox DNA in the same orientation as in the co-crystal structure of MarA bound to the marbox of the mar promoter but also , more importantly , show that amino acids of helix-3 and helix-6 of Rob are bound in vivo to RE1 and RE2 , respectively .

<li>Thus , the unusual mode of target DNA binding by Rob led us to ask whether the binding of Rob to the robbox of class II promoters occludes the binding of σ70 R4 to the − 35 hexamer as does the binding of SoxS .42 The alternative question is whether the presence of the CTD , the absence of DNA bending , and the absence of RE2 binding by Rob 's C-terminal HTH motif such that the motif is not anchored to the DNA in proximity to σ70 R4 have required that Rob make different protein -- protein interactions with σ70 R4 than SoxS during transcription activation of class II promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>We chose these substitutions because the co-crystal structure of MarA bound to the marbox of the mar promoter indicates that R90 of MarA makes a van der Waals contact with C15 , a conserved residue in RE2 ( CAAA ; C15 in boldface ) .21,22 further the transcription activation of class II promoters by Rob , in order to determine whether the presence of the CTD has any effect on the underlying mechanism .

<li>Thus , in comparison to AraC protein , the basis for speciﬁc binding of Rob and SoxS is unclear , especially since a consensus of target sequences is difﬁcult to discern ( 10 , 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although SoxS-dependent activation of fumC and micF requires a total of eight amino acid residues of σ70 R412 ( Table 1 ) , while Rob-dependent activation requires only three ( Table 1 ) , the reduced number of interactions is still sufficient for activation by Rob .

<li>The plasmids pJLR70 , pRGM9818 , pRGM489 , and pRGM5009 were previously constructed by cloning SoxS , MarA , Rob and MarA E89A , respectively , in the original vector pRGM9817 ( Martin et al. , 2000 ; Rosner et al. , 2002 ; Martin & Rosner , 2011 ) .

<li>Moreover , to rule out any possible side effect of PQ treatment , strain M4458b was transformed with the plasmids pRGM9817 , pJLR70 , pRGM9818 , pRGM489 , and pRGM5009 , which respectively correspond to the vector alone or carrying SoxS , MarA , Rob , and MarA E89A ( a modiﬁed MarA protein with the substitution E89A which has been shown to act like SoxS in the preferential activation of the regulon genes ( Martin & Rosner , 2011 ) .

<li>Unlike MarA or SoxS , Rob is present at a high constitutional level ( estimated to be around 5000 per cell ; Skarstad et al. , 1993 ; Kakeda et al. , 1995 ) , which translates to 2 -- 5 mM , and we are not aware of any experimental study showing that the steady-state level of Rob is altered physiologically in response to environmental signals .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>Regardless of the detailed mechanism , our present study as well as that of Rosner et al. ( 2002 ) show clearly that regulation via Rob , involving the binding of effector ligands to the regulator protein , is mechanistically very different from regulation via the Mar or Sox system , which involves alteration of the levels of regulator MarA or SoxS .

<li>However , whereas AraC binds as a dimer ( 15 ) to a direct repeat of the ; 17-bp sequence ( 6 , 7 ) , Rob and SoxS bind their targets as monomers .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the increased production of MarA ( caused by some environmental chemicals , such as salicylate , inactivating its cognate repressor , MarR ) or SoxS ( caused by the inactivation of its repressor SoxR via its oxidation ) or the binding of coregulators such as dipyridyl ( 561 ) or some bile salts ( 558 ) to Rob activates the transcription of micF antisense RNA , decreasing OmpF synthesis .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14665678" target="_blank">14665678</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test whether either MarA or Rob could activate the transcription of yggX , we measured the relative level of yggX mRNA in cells in which the expression of MarA or Rob could be selectively activated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>This experiment con-ﬁrmed the transcriptional activity of artiﬁcially expressed MarA and Rob proteins ( Fig. 4B ) and veriﬁed that they do not activate yggX expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>They did not ﬁnd the mechanism by which inactivation of tolC affects marA expression , but they propose that TolC is involved in one or more pumps responsible for efﬂuxing cellular metabolites ; in a tolC mutant , these metabolites would not be eliminated and would trigger the activation of the MarA/SoxS/Rob system in order to upregulate TolC-mediated efﬂux and restore ho-meostasis ( 41 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20211899" target="_blank">20211899</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the extent of Rob activation of each gene was about twofold less than that effected by MalE-SoxS , the concentration of Rob necessary for maximum activation ( ; 33 nM ) was less than that required by MalE-SoxS ( ; 200 nM ) ( 18 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , Rob and MarA are similar with respect to both the extent of activation and the concentration required for maximum activation ( 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Genetic elimination of both MarA and Rob resulted in complete loss of activation , equal to that seen in marbox transversion mutants ( Fig. 5C ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , as reported here , MarA , SoxS and Rob showed highest afﬁnity for the marbox closer to or overlapping the -35 sequence , which is the primary cis-acting site if not the only , for activation of these genes ( Fawcett and Wolf , 1995 ; Li and Demple , 1996 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Like CAP , MarA , SoxS and Rob are ` ambidextrous ' ( Jair et al. , 1995 , 1996a , 1996b ) : when the marbox is located upstream of the ÿ35 hexamer for RNP binding ( as in the fpr and zwf promoters ) , activation requires interaction with a-CTD ( class I ) ; when the marbox overlaps the ÿ35 hexamer ( as in the fumC , micF and nfo promoters ) , a-CTD is not required for activation ( class II ) .

<li>Despite overlapping regulation by SoxS , MarA , and Rob , the three systems exhibit differential control in terms of both the strength of their effects on individual genes and activation of some promoters uniquely ( e.g. , zwf by SoxS or MarA but not by Rob ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although we have come a long way in the deﬁnition of the marbox sequence and its relationship with differential regulation by MarA , SoxS and Rob , more work still needs to be done to deﬁne and clarify all the different types of interactions that lead to a coordinated and effective cell response to different environmental stresses .

<li>Although the Rob protein 's natural activity in E. coli is not fully understood , Rob can activate many of the same genes as SoxS and MarA3 -- 6 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10802742" target="_blank">10802742</a>]<br></li>
<li>Assays of bgalactosidase due to the expression of micF : : lacZ fusions in strains M3710 and M3944 and inaA : : lacZ fusions in strains M4110 and M4113 showed 19 - , 16 - and 61-fold increases of fusion expression due to the upregulation of MarA , SoxS and Rob respectively .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previously , overexpression of Rob was shown to induce multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance phenotypes ( 3 ) , to activate expression of fumC , inaA , and sodA in vivo ( 3 ) , and to activate the transcription of six mar/soxRS regulon promoters in vitro by mechanisms that are strikingly similar to that of MarA and SoxS ( 22 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , three independently regulated but homologous proteins , MarA , SoxS and Rob , activate a common set of promoters which results in multiple antibiotic resistance , superoxide resistance and organic solvent tolerance ( for review , see Alekshun and Levy , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10564485" target="_blank">10564485</a>]<br></li>
<li>tolC is regulated in part by MarA , SoxS and Rob , three paralogous transcriptional-activators which bind a sequence called the marbox and which activate multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similar results were obtained in strains in which SoxS was overproduced or Rob was activated by treatment with DIP .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Different afﬁnities of MarA , SoxS and Rob for the promoters of these genes , probably dictated by differences among these transcription factor recognition sequences , lead to differential regulation of particular promoters by these proteins , therefore allowing the cell to respond differently to various stresses ( Martin et al. , 2000 ; Grifﬁth and Wolf , 2001 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>For instance , Rob has been shown to-bind and activate the zwf promoter in vitro but whole cell zwf regulation can not be activated by Rob , although the gene responds to SoxS and MarA ( Ariza et al. , 1995 ; Jair et al. , 1995 1996a ; b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>This observation is in agreement with reports of others which found that Rob bound in vitro more tightly than MarA and SoxS to most marboxes ( Martin et al. , 2002 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA , SoxS and Rob bind as monomers to an asymmetrical and degenerate 19 bp DNA sequence known as the marbox ( Martin et al. , 1999 ; Wood et al. , 1999 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , both MarA and Rob are able to repress the rob promoter directly in vitro , and this repression occurs at the level of transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16478729" target="_blank">16478729</a>]<br></li>
<li>Of note , Rob and SoxS also increased transcription in vitro and showed preferential binding to the same nfnB promoter sequence as MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription Studies in Vitro -- To determine whether the binding of MarA/SoxS and Rob to the rob promoter reflected direct repression of the rob promoter , we performed transcription in vitro experiments .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16478729" target="_blank">16478729</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , it would be interesting to purify the MarA , TetD , and Rob proteins and determine their respective abilities to activate in vitro transcription of the fusion constructs , as we have already done with our puriﬁed MalE-SoxS fusion protein ( 19 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896696" target="_blank">7896696</a>]<br></li>
<li>Having previously demonstrated that SoxS ( as a MalE-SoxS fusion protein ) and MarA are essentially identical in their abilities to activate in vitro transcription of genes of the sox-mar regulons , we investigated the properties of Rob as a transcriptional-activator .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Hence , it is possible that the divergence of the nfnB marbox , and more particularly of RE 2 , although allowing in vitro binding by MarA , SoxS and Rob , will effect discriminated regulation of gene expression by the three transcriptional proteins in a physiological context , i.e. within the cell .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although puriﬁed SoxS and Rob proteins , like MarA , activated nfnB transcription in vitro , only constitutive expression of chromosomal marA , but not of soxS and rob genes , affected nfnB expression in whole cells .

<li>Increased expression of nfnB mRNA by plasmid-encoded SoxS and Rob Puriﬁed SoxS and Rob were able to activate nfnB transcription in vitro and bind the nfnB marbox with relatively high afﬁnity even though constitutive chromosomal levels of these proteins did not show a detectable effect on nfnB transcription .

<li>Although Rob , SoxS and MarA activate micF transcription in response to different environmental stimuli , there is some overlap in response .14 soxS is part of the soxRS regulon .66 SoxR is a sensor protein activated by oxidative-stress and in turn it transcriptionally activates soxS .

<li>Despite the absence of functional MarA , MarR , SoxS , Rob , and EmrRAB , salicylate stimulated the wild-type and mutant promoter activities twofold ( Fig. 5D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Surprisingly , salicylate induced a twofold increase in promoter activity from the lacZ fusions that was independent of sequences from 291 to 232 , of MarA , Rob , and SoxS activators and of MarR and EmrR repressors ( Fig. 5D ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , in contrast to SoxS and MarA , whose syntheses are induced by speciﬁc environmental stimuli and elicit a clear defense response , Rob is expressed constitutively and its normal function is unknown .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , it would be of great interest to understand the interaction of multiple regulators such as SoxS , MarA , and perhaps Rob at single sites that could respond differentially to various environmental signals .

<li>Although MarA , SoxS and Rob could increase acrAB transcription when they were overexpressed , these gene products did not appear to be responsible for the acrAB induction by the general stress conditions such as 4 % ethanol , 0.5 M NaCl or the onset of stationary-phase growth in LB medium ( Table 1 ) .

<li>It would be inte-resting to determine under what conditions these acrAB homologues are induced and how they respond to the global stress-induced regulators , including MarA , SoxS and ( possibly ) Rob .

<li>Based on the data presented , we assume that general stress conditions result in the generation of global transcription regulators , which are unlikely to be MarA , SoxS , or Rob , but could be homologues of them .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since SoxS and MarA seem able to activate some of the same genes in vitro , we tested whether intact Rob or its isolated N-terminal 133-residue domain could activate phenotypic antibiotic resistance or speciﬁc genes for antibiotic resistance or oxidative-stress .

<li>However , the expression of these regulators was not affected by AcrS and AcrR ( data not shown ) , indicating that the acrAB repression by AcrR and AcrS is unlikely to be mediated by MarA , SoxS , or Rob .

<li>When expressed from identical plasmid vectors , Rob and SoxS caused increased nfnB expression but it was considerably less than that produced by MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Many bacteria also possess transcription factors , such as the homologous E. coli regulators MarA , Rob , and SoxS ( 3 , 4 ) , that respond to drugs by activating the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in antibiotic efﬂux and detoxiﬁcation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23010927" target="_blank">23010927</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , expression of acrZ is coregulated with acrAB and tolC by MarA , Rob , and SoxS , a set of transcription factors that regulate cellular responses to antibiotics , detergents , and redox-cycling drugs ( 3 ) .

<li>The ﬁrst four were greatly enhanced on overexpression of MarA and SoxS ( growth in IPTG ) or on activation of Rob in strain M4113 by DIP whereas the latter two products were diminished .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcriptionof acrAB is increased in MarA - and SoxS-constitutivemutants , and in a strain overproducing Rob The transcription of acrAB is increased in E. coli strain JHC1069 ( Ma et a / .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>The SoxS paralogs MarA and Rob are not sufﬁcient for activation of yggX .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>These results indicated that MarA , SoxS and Rob were sufﬁcient for transcription activation in vitro of nfnB .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>

<li>However , the observation that in vivo zwf transcription can be activated by MarA and SoxS , but not by Rob ( 5 ) , shows that control by these regulators may not overlap completely .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , transcription of marA is activated by MarA and by the MarA homologs SoxS and Rob , mostly in the presence of the helper protein Fis ( 32 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20211899" target="_blank">20211899</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the observation that SoxS binds to , and seems to negatively regulate , its own promoter ( 33 ) raises the possibility that MarA and Rob could also negatively regulate soxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>

<li>From an analysis of the promoters that are activated by these proteins , it is clear that the orientation of the marbox and its distance from the -10 hexamer of the promoter are critical in determining whether MarA , SoxS and Rob can activate the promoter .

<li>Activation by the monomeric proteins MarA , SoxS and Rob requires that they bind to a marbox located in a particular orientation upstream of the TSS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two previously identiﬁed tolC promoters , p1 and p2 , are not regulated by MarA , SoxS or Rob but p2 is activated by EvgAS and PhoPQ which also regulate other functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , when we compared the induction mediated by plasmid-speciﬁed SoxS and Rob with that of MarA , a striking difference was noticed ( Fig. 8 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>As shown here , p3 and p4 are activated by MarA , SoxS and Rob , with each activator being regulated by different environmental signals .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>The inaA gene is activated by SoxS , MarA , and Rob , with MarA being the strongest activator ( 34 , 43 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>For example , the nfo gene , coding for endonuclease IV , is activated by SoxS but not by MarA or Rob ( 17 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>Similarly , the gshB gene , coding for a glutathione synthase , is activated by MarA but not by SoxS or Rob ( 5 , 39 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>Nevertheless , when induced by paraquat , the activity of SoxS was not dependent on either MarA or Rob ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , the synthesis was high in JA300 derivatives in which MarA production was elevated rather than that of Rob and SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9473050" target="_blank">9473050</a>]<br></li>
<li>The TolC level was regulated positively by MarA , Rob , or SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9473050" target="_blank">9473050</a>]<br></li>
<li>OmpX synthesis is likely to be regulated positively by MarA , Rob , or SoxS ( Fig. 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9473050" target="_blank">9473050</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rob is most closely related to the SoxS , MarA , and TetD proteins2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10802742" target="_blank">10802742</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , we chose to pursue znuACB and its relation to MarA , Rob , and SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22210763" target="_blank">22210763</a>]<br></li>
<li>Other genes reported to be activated by Rob in vitro ( fpr , fumC , micF , nfo , sodA , and zwf ) ( 15 ) or by Rob overexpression in vivo ( fumC , inaA , micF , and sodA ) ( 5 ) were not found in our study ; thus , it appears that the mutagenesis and screening procedure was not saturating .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>After normalization to the gnd internal control , the extent of Rob activation was as follows : zwf , 3.9 ; fpr , 2.1 ; fumC , 8.0 ; micF , 31 ; nfo , 2.7 ; and sodA , 2.1 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rob binding to zwf and to fumC induced a bend of ; 308 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>The structure of Rob bound to the micF marbox ( 19 ) is not pertinent here as it appears to be , in part , an artifact of crystal packing .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21097628" target="_blank">21097628</a>]<br></li>
<li>The reason for the difference between the in vivo and in vitro effects of Rob is unknown .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Presumably , Rob has the potential to activate transcription of target genes , but its constitutive level or activity is too low during normal growth .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>We determined the effect of Rob on transcription of the MudJ insertions in minimal medium .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>The effect of each combination of alleles on transcription activation was determined by assay of βgalactosidase activity after induction of Rob expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Under the standard conditions , Rob enhanced transcription from the three hybrid promoters by about 1.5-fold ( data not shown ) , whereas under conditions of limiting RNA polymerase , the extent of activation by Rob was ; 3-fold ( Fig. 3B ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , despite being present in ; 5,000 molecules per cell ( 31 ) , Rob is unable to activate zwf transcription in vivo , even though it can bind to zwf DNA in vitro and activate transcription from the same sequences used by SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , even when bound to the zwf promoter , Rob may not be correctly oriented to activate RNA polymerase .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>In vitr binding of Rob to the micF promoter has been demonstrated previously ( 5 , 19 ) , and Rob activates the transcription of micF in vitro ( 15 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>To deﬁne further the sequences required for Rob activation of the zwf promoter , we determined whether Rob could stimulate in vitro transcription with DNA templates prepared from constructs Z3G4 , Z4G4 , and Z5G4 , in which zwf soxbox-mar-box-containing sequences 276 to 242 , 267 to 242 , and 262 to 242 , respectively , have been placed upstream of the gnd promoter 's 235 hexamer ( 9 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>In preliminary experiments , Rob activation of zwf and fumC transcription was maximal when open complexes were formed in the presence of 1 pmol of Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , to ensure that Rob was not limiting , activation reactions contained 2 pmol of Rob ( 67 nM ) ; other parameters of in vitro transcription , e.g. , salt concentration , were not optimized for each test promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , the 59 boundary of the sequence element required for Rob activation of zwf transcription in vitro lies between 258 and 261 and is identical to that of the soxbox-marbox .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>

[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>n any event , the findings in this study provide us with some clues to the function of Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7476863" target="_blank">7476863</a>]<br></li>
<li>( a ) The crystal structure of the Rob -- micF binary complex39 highlighting amino acid -- nucleotide interactions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>The application of epistasis used here is to address the question of whether the side group of an amino acid residue within a recognition helix of Rob interacts specifically with a functional group of a given base pair in the corresponding recognition element in a robbox .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Importantly , we also carried out a genetic epistasis experiment to determine whether the side group of an amino acid within helix-6 of Rob 's C-terminal HTH motif interacts specifically with a functional group of a base pair of RE2 in the robbox of the micF promoter , as do amino acids of helix-6 of MarA and base pair of RE2 in the marbox of the mar promoter .41 We note that the amino acid sequences of helix-6 of Rob and MarA are identical at 10 of 12 positions .16 To conduct the genetic epistasis test , we used site-directed mutagenesis to substitute amino acid R90 of pBAD33-Rob with alanine43 and to introduce a C15G substitution into the robbox of a micF-lac fusion carried on plasmid pMLB1022 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>) In the MarA -- mar structure , the recognition helices of both the N-terminal HTH motif ( helix-3 ) and the C-terminal HTH motif ( helix-6 ) are bound to successive major grooves containing recognition elements 1 and 2 ( RE1 and RE2 ) , respectively .20,41 In contrast , the structure of the Rob -- micF complex shows that the recognition helix of the N-terminal HTH motif ( helix-3 ) binds RE1 of the robbox while that of the C-terminal HTH motif ( helix-6 ) is not bound to DNA .39 Moreover , the DNA in the MarA -- mar co-crystal structure is bent Results 35 ° ,41 whereas the DNA in the Rob -- micF co-crystal structure is straight ,39 probably because Rob 's second HTH motif does not specifically contact base pairs in RE2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>In particular , recognition helix-3 and helix-6 of MarA 's dual HTH motifs bind RE1 and RE2 , respectively , of mar 's robbox , while helix-3 within Rob 's N-terminal HTH motif binds RE1 of micF 's robbox , but helix-6 does not bind RE2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Figure 3b shows that W36A within helix-3 of Rob is epistatic to C5T within RE1 of the micF robbox , indicating that the side group of W36 specifically contacts a functional group of C5 in vivo , just as it does in the co-crystal structure .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Accordingly , since an amino acid located within Rob 's N-terminal HTH motif contacts a nucleotide of RE1 and since the binding of Rob to the micF promoter region protects the entire 20 bp robbox and one to two additional base pairs on either side from attack by DNase I ,18 the position and orientation of Rob on the micF robbox in vivo is the same as that observed in the co-crystal structure .39 To determine if an epistatic interaction occurs between Rob 's C-terminal HTH motif and RE2 , we compared the effects on transcription-activation of the micF-lac fusion by wildtype Rob or substitution R90A in combination with either the wild-type robbox or its substitution C15G .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , these data not only show that the orientation of Rob on the robbox of the micF promoter is the same as that in the co-crystal structure but also provide in vivo evidence that an amino acid within Rob 's C-terminal HTH motif specifically contacts a base pair within RE2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>We tested this hypothesis by constructing a plasmid ( pSRob133 ) encoding a truncated Rob protein with only the 123 N-terminal residues and 10 additional amino acids encoded by the vector ( Rob133 [ Table 1 ] ) .

<li>This strain contained a plasmid coding for a Rob protein lacking most of its CTD ( amino acids 124 -- 199 ) , connected to a hexahistidine tag .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>We offer three explanations for why none of the class II substitutions are epistatic to K593A : ( i ) K593 interacts with the keto group of a peptide bond , and hence , the interaction is unaffected by any amino acid substitution at that position ; ( ii ) K593 interacts with an undiscovered amino acid residue of Rob that confers a PC mutant phenotype when substituted with alanine ; or ( iii ) the activation defect conferred by K593A results from a negative effect ( direct or indirect ) of the mutation on Rob 's ability to make a protein -- DNA interaction with the robbox of the fumC promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>If the side group of the wild-type amino acid makes a specific protein -- DNA contact with a functional group of the wild-type base pair , then the effect on transcription-activation of combining a single alanine substitution of that amino acid of Rob and a single base-pair substitution at that position of the robbox would not be significantly different from that conferred by the more severe of the two individual mutations ; that is , the effect on activation conferred by one mutation would be masked by the effect conferred by the other , and thus , the mutations would be epistatic to one another .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>On the other hand , if the side group of a given wild-type amino acid residue does not make a specific protein -- DNA contact with a functional group of a wild-type base pair , then the effect on transcription-activation of combining a single alanine substitution of that amino acid of Rob and a single base-pair substitution at that position of the robbox would be significantly different from that conferred by the more severe of the two individual mutations ; that is , the effect on activation conferred by one mutation would not be masked by the effect conferred by the other , and thus , the mutations would be non-epistatic to one another .42,48 According to the co-crystal structure of Rob bound to micF DNA ( Fig. 3a ) , residue W36 in helix-3 of Rob 's N-terminal HTH motif makes a van der Waals contact with nucleotide C5 in RE1 ( GCAC ; C5 in boldface ) ,39 the most highly conserved residue in the Rob/SoxS / MarA binding sites.20-22 ,39 Indeed , changing C5 to any of the other three nucleotides severely reduces SoxS-dependent transcription-activation of the fpr and zwf promoters .20 Thus , for our epistasis experiment , we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a C5T substitution into the robbox of a micF-lac transcriptional fusion carried on plasmid pMLB1022 and to prepare a derivative of plasmid pBAD33-Rob carrying substitution W36A of Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , a goal of this study was to determine whether Rob makes protein -- protein interactions with σ70 R4 at class II promoters and , if so , whether the interactions occlude the binding of σ70 R4 to the − 35 hexamer despite the presence of the CTD .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Accordingly , at the two promoters , Rob makes no more than three protein -- protein interactions with σ70 R4 , whereas SoxS may make as many as 11 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Using these PC mutants in genetic epistasis tests , we identified amino acid residues in σ70 R4 that make specific protein -- protein interactions with amino acids within the class II PC surface of Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>For these experiments , we applied the same logic as was used in the epistasis tests aimed at identifying interactions between amino acids of Rob and base pair of the robbox ( Fig. 3 ) , except that , here , the purpose of the test is to determine whether the R groups of a pair of amino acid residues , one residing on Rob and the other residing on σ70 R4 , interact with one another .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Identification of PC mutations of Rob that reduce transcription-activation of class II promoters Recently , we showed that SoxS and σ70 R4 interact with one another in the yeast two-hybrid system and that the interaction is disrupted by mutations of the class I/II surface but is not disrupted by mutations of the class II surface .12 Thus , we concluded that the protein -- protein interaction in yeast between SoxS and σ70 R4 can occur in solution , that is , `` off DNA '' , and requires amino acids of the class I/II surface but not amino acids of the class II surface .12 In turn , this indicates that the interactions in E. coli between amino acid residues of the class II surface of SoxS and amino acid residues of σ70 R4 occur `` on DNA '' .12 Given the data presented above indicating that Rob 's CTD does not interfere with the binding of Rob 's Nterminal domain ( NTD ) to the robbox of a class II promoter or its activation of several of them ( Figs. 2 and 3 ) , together with the high degree of amino acid sequence identity between the C-terminal HTH motifs of SoxS and Rob ( 9 of 16 amino acids match ) ,16 we hypothesize here that , at class II promoters , SoxS and Rob interact with RNAP using similar functional domains .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>We note that Lonetto et al. determined that , even in the absence of full induction of the lac promoter by treatment with IPTG , the plasmid-encoded σ70 proteins are produced to a level about equal to that of the chromosomally encoded wild-type protein .13 As such , when an alanine substitution of f a tri-alanine scanning library of σ70 R4 at positions 531 -- 590 on Rob-dependent tion activation With a tri-alanine scanning library of amino acid residues of σ70 from positions 531 -- 590 ( residues 531 -- 540 lie in the distal portion of σ70 R3 .2 , residues 541 -- 570 lie in σ70 R4 .1 , and residues 571 -- 590 lie in the N-terminal portion of σ70 R4 .2 ) , 1,46,47 we recently determined that none of the amino acid residues within this region are required for SoxS-dependent activation of transcription from class II promoters fumC and micF , including some substitutions that replace amino acids that are known to interact with nucleotides of the − 35 hexamer .14,42 However , several of the tri-alanine substitutions reduced the basal level of transcription from these class II promoters .42 We inferred from these data that the binding of SoxS to the soxboxes of the class II promoters masks the effects of the tri-alanine substitutions that reduce basal transcription by occluding the binding there of σ70 R3 .2 -- R4 .2.42 Accordingly , we used this library to determine whether Rob and σ70 R3 .2 -- R4 .2 can accommodate one another during transcription-activation of class II promoters .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Using the same tri-alanine scanning library of amino acid residues 530 -- 590 of σ70 R4 as was used in the experiments with SoxS ,42 we found that none of the substitutions reduce Rob-dependent transcription-activation of the fumC , inaA , and micF promoters ( Fig. 2a -- c ) , as was also the case with SoxS .42 Thus , presuming that occlusion requires a specific conformation of the DNA-bound activator , Rob 's CTD does not affect Rob 's ability to carry out this unusual function .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>The answer is that σ70 R4 is not the only surface of RNAP with which Rob makes protein -- protein interactions : like many other transcriptional activators , Rob requires the CTD of the RNAP α subunit for activation of transcription from both class I and class II promoters .31 However , alanine scanning mutagenesis of the αCTD ( amino acid residues 255 -- 329 ) showed that , unlike most other transcription activators that make protein -- protein interactions with the αCTD through interaction with the 261 , 265 , and/or 287 determinants,6,8,53-55 Rob-dependent transcription-activation of class II promoters fumC , micF , and inaA requires the side groups of amino acid residues within and near the `` 265 determinant '' .31 Thus , with Rob-dependent transcription-activation of fumC , micF , and inaA employing the side groups of seven , six , and seven amino acids of the αCTD , respectively , the potential problem of too little protein -- protein interaction specificity and too little binding affinity is non-existent .31 Previously , we used the alanine scanning library of the αCTD to identify amino acid residues that are required for SoxS-dependent transcription-activation of both class I and class II promoters56 ( M. A. Zafar , K. L. Griffith , and R.E.W. , unpublished results ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this work , we observed that Rob makes only one protein -- protein interaction with σ70 R4 at the fumC ( D75 -- R599 ) and micF ( D75 -- R603 ) promoters , respectively ( Table 1 ) , while SoxS makes three at fumC and four at micF .12 In addition , substitution K593A is the only other substitution of σ70 R4 that reduces Rob-dependent transcription-activation , and it does so only at the fumC but not at the micF promoter ( Table 1 ) ; since no epistatic interaction with it was identified , we presume that the side group of K593 interacts with Rob 's polypeptide backbone or with DNA .52 In contrast , R596A and R599A of σ70 R4 reduce SoxS activation of both promoters , but none of the four potential epistatic interactions were found ; as such , their side groups are presumed to interact with DNA or with the polypeptide backbone of Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although SoxS-dependent activation of fumC and micF requires a total of eight amino acid residues of σ70 R412 ( Table 1 ) , while Rob-dependent activation requires only three ( Table 1 ) , the reduced number of interactions is still sufficient for activation by Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Another unusual property of SoxS is that the same amino acid residue of its class II surface ( D75 ) contacts two different amino acids of σ70 R4 during transcription-activation of fumC ( R599 ) and micF ( R603 ) .12 Remarkably , the genetic epistasis experiments presented in Figs. 5d and 6b show that D75 of Rob , like D75 of SoxS , contacts R599 of σ70 R4 at the fumC promoter and R603 at the micF promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , whereas SoxS requires the same four amino acid residues of σ70 ( K593 , R596 , R599 , and R603 ) in its activation of the two class II promoters , Rob requires two of them at the fumC promoter ( K593 and R599 ) , a third ( R603 ) at the micF promoter , and the fourth ( R596 ) at neither .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , a single amino acid residue of Rob , D75 , interacts with different residues of σ70 R4 , depending on the promoter , that is , with R599 at the fumC promoter and with R603 at the micF promoter .

<li>Other members of the AraC-family share the property of low solubility .15 -- 18 Structure determination has been possible , however , for DNA-bound forms of two AraC-family members , MarA19 and Rob .20 These findings plus the fact that many DNA-binding domains undergo substantial structural rearrangements upon binding to DNA ,21 raise the possibility that DNA-binding domains in the AraC-family may be partially or even largely unfolded when free in solution .

<li>This corresponding pocket in Rob includes an antiparallel β-strand and its connecting loop ( Figs 4 , 6 ) , which is the acidic β3-β4 loop spanning residues 187 -- 193 ( described above ) that has an extended conformation in the Rob -- DNA structure .

<li>We thus divided the repertoire of helix-turn-helix TFs into three categories : ( a ) classical HTH ( cHTH ) proteins with a tight loop between H-1 and H-2 , and no additional elements in the C-terminus , e.g. the GalR/LacI , family ( see Table 1 ) ; ( b ) the winged HTH proteins ( wHTH ) containing the C-terminal - hairpin and , in some proteins additional - sheets in between H-1 and H-2 , such as the OmpR , family ; and ( c ) the miscellaneous HTH ( mHTH ) , an heterogeneous collection of proteins that differ from the typical HTH in certain features , such as shortened helices or the incorporation into other super-structures , e.g. Rob in E. coli ( Tobes and Ramos , 2002 ) , or members of the enhancer-binding proteins ( EBP ) .

<li>A second gene with strong homology to Rob is the E. coli SoxS protein ( 55 % identity in a 105-amino acid overlap ) ; SoxS is involved in the control of the superoxide response regulon ( 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8449900" target="_blank">8449900</a>]<br></li>

<li>The MarA structurally related transcriptional activators , SoxS and Rob , also recognize the marbox sequence and activate a similar set of regulon genes ( Ariza et al. , 1995 ; Demple , 1996 ; Jair et al. , 1996a , b ) .

<li>Many bacteria also possess transcription factors , such as the homologous E. coli regulators MarA , Rob , and SoxS ( 3 , 4 ) , that respond to drugs by activating the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in antibiotic efﬂux and detoxiﬁcation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23010927" target="_blank">23010927</a>]<br></li>

<li>Recently , it was reported that acrAB is also induced by bile-salts and fatty-acids via the Rob system ( Rosenberg et al. , 2003 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15686558" target="_blank">15686558</a>]<br></li>
<li>In addition , studies demonstrate that Rob induced by decanoate or bile-salts results in the increased expression of acrAB in the absence of both the mar and sox loci ( 12 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16478729" target="_blank">16478729</a>]<br></li>
<li>Both fusions terminate at position 3176145 , which is 91 bp downstream of the marbox , and both were signiﬁcantly activated by agents known to activate marA and soxS transcription or Rob function ( salicylate , paraquat and DIP respectively ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Decanoate induces the acrAB operon even when the rob gene is under lac promoter control The binding of inducers to Rob protein , but not to the CTD-truncated Rob , suggests strongly that they function by altering the activity of pre-existing Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>c For the mb63 insertion ( galT ) , ( 2 ) indicates negative control by Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>Recent genetic data show that Rob represses transcription of the galT gene ( M.H.J.B. and B.D. , unpublished results ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10802742" target="_blank">10802742</a>]<br></li>
<li>One gene , galT , was repressed by Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>In this study , galT was the only gene repressed by Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>SoxS and Rob can also up-regulate acrAB ( 22 ) but are not involved here , since , as already shown , in the absence of the mar operon , mppA : : Cm has no effect on antibiotic sensitivity .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10438753" target="_blank">10438753</a>]<br></li>
<li>1 The intrinsic expression of Rob in a ﬁs rob mar strain was sufﬁcient to induce transcription of the mar promoter approximately 1.7-fold relative to that in the corresponding ﬁs rob mar strain .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Therefore , both MarA and Rob are able to repress the rob promoter directly in vitro , and this repression occurs at the level of transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16478729" target="_blank">16478729</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA is a global regulator of genes induced by antibiotics and is a member of a subfamily of AraC-like transcriptional regulators called the Mar Sox Rob family ( 14 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11742080" target="_blank">11742080</a>]<br></li>
<li>Increased expression of nfnB mRNA by plasmid-encoded SoxS and Rob Puriﬁed SoxS and Rob were able to activate nfnB transcription in vitro and bind the nfnB marbox with relatively high afﬁnity even though constitutive chromosomal levels of these proteins did not show a detectable effect on nfnB transcription .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Thus , despite being present in ; 5,000 molecules per cell ( 31 ) , Rob is unable to activate zwf transcription in vivo , even though it can bind to zwf DNA in vitro and activate transcription from the same sequences used by SoxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>Additionally , and despite similarities in the structures of their DNA binding domains and cognate DNA binding sites , the SoxS homologs MarA and Rob did not activate in vivo transcription of yggX under the conditions tested ( Fig. 4 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>They did not ﬁnd the mechanism by which inactivation of tolC affects marA expression , but they propose that TolC is involved in one or more pumps responsible for efﬂuxing cellular metabolites ; in a tolC mutant , these metabolites would not be eliminated and would trigger the activation of the MarA/SoxS/Rob system in order to upregulate TolC-mediated efﬂux and restore ho-meostasis ( 41 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20211899" target="_blank">20211899</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although the Rob protein 's natural activity in E. coli is not fully understood , Rob can activate many of the same genes as SoxS and MarA3 -- 6 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10802742" target="_blank">10802742</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although MarA , SoxS and Rob could increase acrAB transcription when they were overexpressed , these gene products did not appear to be responsible for the acrAB induction by the general stress conditions such as 4 % ethanol , 0.5 M NaCl or the onset of stationary-phase growth in LB medium ( Table 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>Previously , overexpression of Rob was shown to induce multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance phenotypes ( 3 ) , to activate expression of fumC , inaA , and sodA in vivo ( 3 ) , and to activate the transcription of six mar/soxRS regulon promoters in vitro by mechanisms that are strikingly similar to that of MarA and SoxS ( 22 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>First , three independently regulated but homologous proteins , MarA , SoxS and Rob , activate a common set of promoters which results in multiple antibiotic resistance , superoxide resistance and organic solvent tolerance ( for review , see Alekshun and Levy , 1997 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10564485" target="_blank">10564485</a>]<br></li>
<li>tolC is regulated in part by MarA , SoxS and Rob , three paralogous transcriptional activators which bind a sequence called the marbox and which activate multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Effects of Rob on gene expression were also explored with lac reporter genes linked to the promoter of sodA , the gene encoding managanese-containing superoxide dismutase ( 4 , 18 , 42 ) , and to the coding region of inaA , which encodes a protein of unknown function ( 43 ) controlled by MarA and SoxS ( 36 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>Down-regulation of rob mediated by MarA ( and also SoxS and Rob ) adds to the regulatory cross-talk already reported ( 15 -- 17 ) and shows that the rob promoter and protein are controlled at both pre - and posttranscriptional levels in vivo .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16478729" target="_blank">16478729</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , in contrast to SoxS and MarA , whose syntheses are induced by speciﬁc environmental stimuli and elicit a clear defense response , Rob is expressed constitutively and its normal function is unknown .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>The signaling mechanisms that prevail in OmpR , MarA , and SoxS action are known .9,10,14 Activation of micF by Rob in response to cationic peptide antibiotics is not as well formulated .32 Transcriptional activators of micF Transcriptional regulators are known to activate micF expression in response to environmental factors ( Figure 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11601842" target="_blank">11601842</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although Rob , SoxS and MarA activate micF transcription in response to different environmental stimuli , there is some overlap in response .14 soxS is part of the soxRS regulon .66 SoxR is a sensor protein activated by oxidative stress and in turn it transcriptionally activates soxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11601842" target="_blank">11601842</a>]<br></li>
<li>This selective expression of MarA and Rob was achieved by using strains MB102 ( marA ) ( 39 ) and MB101 ( robA ) ( 6 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>To test whether either MarA or Rob could activate the transcription of yggX , we measured the relative level of yggX mRNA in cells in which the expression of MarA or Rob could be selectively activated .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>This experiment con-ﬁrmed the transcriptional activity of artiﬁcially expressed MarA and Rob proteins ( Fig. 4B ) and veriﬁed that they do not activate yggX expression .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>Northern analysis conﬁrmed the transcriptional activation of yggX by oxidative stress or SoxS expression but not in response to the related MarA or Rob proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>
<li>In contrast , the level of yggX transcript was unaffected by the expression of MarA or Rob ( Fig. 4A ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14594836" target="_blank">14594836</a>]<br></li>

<li>The p1 promoter is not responsive to EvgAS , PhoPQ , MarA , SoxS or Rob but seems to have signiﬁcant constitutive expression under laboratory conditions ( Eguchi et al. , 2003 ; Figs 1 and 2 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although puriﬁed SoxS and Rob proteins , like MarA , activated nfnB transcription in vitro , only constitutive expression of chromosomal marA , but not of soxS and rob genes , affected nfnB expression in whole cells .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Still , constitutive expression of chromosomally speciﬁed SoxS and Rob did not activate nfnB expression in whole cells ( Figs 2 and 7 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Although MarA and SoxS regulation works by the alteration of their own expression levels , it was not known how Rob , which is constitutively expressed , exerts its regulatory action .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>b Rob presence was due to chromosomal wild-type rob expression , SoxS presence was due to paraquat induction of the otherwise quiescent soxRS , and MarA presence was due to plasmid p37 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=9393706" target="_blank">9393706</a>]<br></li>
<li>Increased expression , but limited as compared with MarA , was only achieved by plasmid-mediated overexpression of SoxS and Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Comparison of the regulation of nfnB expression by the plasmid-speciﬁed IPTG-inducible MarA , SoxS and Rob proteins .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>Transcription of nfnB is greatly increased by induced or constitutive chromosomal expression of MarA but is unaltered by constitutive expression of chromosomal SoxS and Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>When expressed from identical plasmid vectors , Rob and SoxS caused increased nfnB expression but it was considerably less than that produced by MarA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , in Rob the 100-residue domain homologous to SoxS and MarA is located at the N terminus of the protein ; the C-terminal 175-residue segment of Rob is not related to XylS-AraC family members ( 40 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>The three paralogous Escherichia coli AraC/XylS family activators MarA , SoxS , and Rob are regulated by three different systems ( marRAB , soxRS , and rob , respectively ) in response to different stresses ( 29 ) .

<li>Its expression is regulated by three XylS/AraC family regulators , MarA , SoxS and Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12791142" target="_blank">12791142</a>]<br></li>
<li>( 1991 ) Same as GC4468 ; marR ( cfxB1 ) JHC1069 Discussion Transcription of acrAB is up-regulated in mutants constitutively producing MarA or SoxS and in a strain that overexpresses Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>It would be inte-resting to determine under what conditions these acrAB homologues are induced and how they respond to the global stress-induced regulators , including MarA , SoxS and ( possibly ) Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8821940" target="_blank">8821940</a>]<br></li>
<li>For instance , the expression of acrAB in E. coli is controlled by repressor protein AcrR , global activator protein MarA , SoxS , Rob and quorum sensing regulator LuxR homologue protein SdiA .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15686558" target="_blank">15686558</a>]<br></li>
<li>It is known that acrAB expression is also controlled by the global regulators MarA , SoxS , and Rob ( 4 , 5 , 10 , 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18567659" target="_blank">18567659</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the expression of these regulators was not affected by AcrS and AcrR ( data not shown ) , indicating that the acrAB repression by AcrR and AcrS is unlikely to be mediated by MarA , SoxS , or Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18567659" target="_blank">18567659</a>]<br></li>
<li>MarA , Rob , and SoxS are highly homologous transcription factors that recognize the same consensus binding site ( AYnGCACnnWnnRYYAAAY ) ( 21 ) and are induced by noxious compounds such as antibiotics , detergents , and oxidizing agents .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23010927" target="_blank">23010927</a>]<br></li>

<li>Expression of acrZ is coregulated with acrAB and tolC by the MarA , Rob , and SoxS transcription factors .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23010927" target="_blank">23010927</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , expression of acrZ is coregulated with acrAB and tolC by MarA , Rob , and SoxS , a set of transcription factors that regulate cellular responses to antibiotics , detergents , and redox-cycling drugs ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23010927" target="_blank">23010927</a>]<br></li>
<li>Many bacteria also possess transcription factors , such as the homologous E. coli regulators MarA , Rob , and SoxS ( 3 , 4 ) , that respond to drugs by activating the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in antibiotic efﬂux and detoxiﬁcation .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23010927" target="_blank">23010927</a>]<br></li>
<li>The expression of micF is also induced by toxic agents , such as paraquat and weak acids , by the SoxS , MarA , and Rob transcription factors , which bind to the same sequence element in the micF promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15466019" target="_blank">15466019</a>]<br></li>
<li>Since these transcription activation properties of Rob are virtually identical to those of MalE-SoxS and MarA , it appears as if the E. coli genome encodes three genes with the same functional capacity .

<li>For instance , Rob has been shown to bind and activate the zwf promoter in vitro but whole cell zwf regulation can not be activated by Rob , although the gene responds to SoxS and MarA ( Ariza et al. , 1995 ; Jair et al. , 1995 1996a ; b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12100559" target="_blank">12100559</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the observation that SoxS binds to , and seems to negatively regulate , its own promoter ( 33 ) raises the possibility that MarA and Rob could also negatively regulate soxS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8636021" target="_blank">8636021</a>]<br></li>

<li>From an analysis of the promoters that are activated by these proteins , it is clear that the orientation of the marbox and its distance from the -10 hexamer of the promoter are critical in determining whether MarA , SoxS and Rob can activate the promoter .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activation by the monomeric proteins MarA , SoxS and Rob requires that they bind to a marbox located in a particular orientation upstream of the TSS .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>

<li>Results and discussion tolC TSSs Transcription of tolC is activated by MarA , SoxS and Rob ( Aono et al. , 1998 ) but the relevant tolC promoter has not yet been deﬁned .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>On re-investigation , we found two new TSSs for tolC ( corresponding to promoters p3 and p4 ) that lie downstream of the marbox and are activated by MarA , SoxS and Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>Two previously identiﬁed tolC promoters , p1 and p2 , are not regulated by MarA , SoxS or Rob but p2 is activated by EvgAS and PhoPQ which also regulate other functions .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>We conclude that the tolC promoter ( s ) activated by MarA , SoxS and Rob must lie downstream of p1 and p2 .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18673442" target="_blank">18673442</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , the observation that in vivo zwf transcription can be activated by MarA and SoxS , but not by Rob ( 5 ) , shows that control by these regulators may not overlap completely .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>Moreover , transcription of marA is activated by MarA and by the MarA homologs SoxS and Rob , mostly in the presence of the helper protein Fis ( 32 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20211899" target="_blank">20211899</a>]<br></li>

<li>This analysis also predicts that nfo is not inducible by Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>Rob contributes signiﬁcantly to the expression of the marRAB operon , which regulates the intrinsic resistance of E. coli to various antibiotics , bactericidal agents , and organic solvents ( 5 , 10 , 13 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>We identiﬁed eight genes and conﬁrmed that seven are transcriptionally activated by normal expression of Rob from the chromosomal rob gene ( inaA , marR , aslB , ybaO , mdlA , yfhD , and ybiS ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our analysis revealed that inaA , marRAB , aslB , ybaO , mdlA , yfhD , and ybiS were transcriptionally activated by constitutive levels of Rob , while galT expression was repressed .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>To identify genes regulated by Rob , we screened a library of random lacZ transcriptional fusions ( generated by MudJ ) for differential expression in the presence and absence of Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>These ﬁndings may be explained by the increased soxS expression and Rob activity also found in a tolC mutant ( 41 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20211899" target="_blank">20211899</a>]<br></li>
<li>Our ﬁnding that 60 % of mar expression depends on the presence of Rob agrees with previous observations that ; 65 % of mar transcription depends on Rob , and that mar transcription can be further induced by Rob overexpression ( 21 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>However , it is not known whether normal expression of Rob contributes to the in vivo expression of these genes .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>What remains to be tested is whether constitutive Rob contributes to the basal expression of genes known to be induced by Rob overexpression , namely , fumC , sodA , and inaA ( 3 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8626315" target="_blank">8626315</a>]<br></li>
<li>When A600 of the cultures reached 0.1 -- 0.2 , Rob expression in half of them was induced with 0.2 % arabinose and the other half was uninduced .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22465792" target="_blank">22465792</a>]<br></li>
<li>Activation of gene expression by Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>Maximum Rob expression ( after induction by IPTG ) increased the expression of sodA : : lacZ only ca .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=7896685" target="_blank">7896685</a>]<br></li>
<li>The putative Mar-Sox-Rob box is located just downstream of tolCP2 ( Fig. 2b ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14523115" target="_blank">14523115</a>]<br></li>
<li>The other nine insertions mapped to genes that were not known to be regulated by Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>The overexpression of Rob also confers resistance against multiple antibiotics and oxidative stress , although the triggering signal of Rob is not yet known ( 5 ) .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19376854" target="_blank">19376854</a>]<br></li>
<li>The ; 250-bp sequence directly upstream of the mdlA gene has low afﬁnity for Rob .	[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10850996" target="_blank">10850996</a>]<br></li>
<li>The role of Rob in basal expression of marRAB , mdlA , and micF was further substantiated by in vitro binding assays of Rob to the respective promoter regions of these genes , where Rob showed the highest apparent binding afﬁnity to the marRAB and micF promoter fragments .
