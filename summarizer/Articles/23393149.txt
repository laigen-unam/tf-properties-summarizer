OmpW is a minor porin whose biological function has not been clearly defined . 
Evidence obtained in our laboratory indicates that in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium the expression of OmpW is activated by SoxS upon exposure to paraquat and it is required for resistance . 
SoxS belongs to the AraC family of transcriptional regulators , like MarA and Rob . 
Due to their high 
structural similarity , the genes under their control have been grouped in the mar/sox/rob regulon , which presents a DNA-binding consensus sequence denominated the marsox box . 
In this work , we evaluated the role of the transcription factors MarA , SoxS and Rob of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in regulating ompW expression in response to menadione . 
We determined the 
transcript and protein levels of OmpW in different genetic backgrounds ; in the wild-type and Drob strains ompW was upregulated in response to menadione , while in the DmarA and DsoxS strains the induction was abolished . 
In a double marA soxS mutant , ompW transcript levels were lowered after exposure to menadione , and only complementation in trans with both genes restored the 
positive regulation . 
Using transcriptional fusions and electrophoretic mobility shift assays with mutant versions of the promoter region we demonstrated that two of the predicted sites were functional . 
Additionally , we demonstrated that MarA increases the affinity of SoxS for the ompW promoter region . 
In conclusion , our study shows that ompW is upregulated in response to

INTRODUCTION 
Porins are aqueous channels that allow the passive diffusion of hydrophilic solutes , nutrients or toxic compounds through the bacterial outer membrane and participate , at least in part , in the ability of bacteria to adapt to diverse environments , in drug resistance mechan-isms and in bacterial pathogenesis ( Benz & Bauer , 1988 ; Chatfield et al. , 1991 ; Jeanteur et al. , 1991 ; Weiss et al. , 1991 ; Groisman & Ochman , 1994 ; Nikaido , 1996 ; Zgurskaya & Nikaido , 2000 ; Koebnik et al. , 2000 ; Rodrıguez-Morales et al. , 2006 ) . 
Some years ago , Morimyo ( 1988 ) isolated and characterized Escherichia coli mutants sensitive to paraquat , a superoxide-generating compound ( Hassan & Fridovich , 1979 ) . 
The deleted region in E. coli is highly conserved in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and contains the ompW gene ( Gil et al. , 2007 ) , which encodes a minor porin that has been well studied and its structure in E. coli and Vibrio cholerae has

been described , although its biological function has not been clearly defined ( Nandi et al. , 2005 ; Hong et al. , 2006 ) . 
It is thought to be involved in osmoregulation , since in Vibrio alginolyticus high salt concentrations ( NaCl 4 % ) induce its expression ( Xu et al. , 2005 ) . 
Furthermore , a S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ceftriaxone-resistant strain showed decreased expression of ompW , suggesting that it might be involved in the uptake of this antibiotic ( Hu et al. , 2005 ) . 
Evidence obtained in our laboratory indicates that in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s OmpW expression is increased in the presence of paraquat and it mediates resistance ( Gil et al. , 2007 ) . 
The cellular response to superoxide ( O2 ) is regulated at 2 the transcriptional level by the SoxRS system ( Greenberg et al. , 1990 ) . 
Upon exposure to O2 and/or ammonium 2 quaternary compounds , SoxR is oxidized and converted to an active form that induces the transcription of soxS , which binds to the promoter regions of several genes whose products are involved in the response to oxidative damage ( Storz & Imlay , 1999 ; Scandalios , 2002 ; Imlay , 2008 ; Gu & Imlay , 2011 ) . 
In this context , the evidence supports a model in which ammonium quaternary compounds are responsible for SoxR activation ( Krapp et al. , 2011 ; Gu & Imlay , 2011 ) ; however , it has been recently confirmed that 
066050 G 2013 SGM Printed in Great Britain 
O2 is also able to oxidize its 2Fe -- 2S cluster ( Fujikawa 2 et al. , 2012 ) . 
SoxS belongs to the AraC family of transcriptional regulators , of which MarA and Rob are also members ( Martin & Rosner , 2002 ) . 
In E. coli MarA , SoxS and the N-terminal domain of Rob , which include the DNA-binding domain , share approximately 50 % amino acid sequence identity ( Jair et al. , 1995 , 1996 ; Tobes & Ramos , 2002 ) . 
The mar/sox/rob regulons overlap and together they co-regulate , by direct binding to the promoter regions , more than 40 different genes ( Aono et al. , 1998 ; Martin et al. , 1999 , 2000 ; Martin & Rosner , 2002 ) . 
Expression of MarA , SoxS and Rob is increased upon exposure to a wide variety of signals . 
MarA is increased in response to weak acid conditions and salicylate treatment ( Pomposiello et al. , 2001 ) ; SoxS in response to nitric oxide , superoxide and ammonium quaternary compounds ( Li & Demple , 1994 ; Vasil ' eva et al. , 2001 ) ; and Rob after treatment with bile salts and dipyridyl ( Storz & Imlay , 1999 ; Semchyshyn et al. , 2005 ; Kwon et al. , 2000 ) . 
In E. coli , their upregulation is correlated with changes in the expression of genes involved in the efflux of antibiotics ( acrAB and tolC ) , decrease in outer-membrane permeab-ility ( micF ) , superoxide resistance ( fpr and sodA ) , DNA repair systems ( nfo ) and those with unknown function ( Aono et al. , 1998 ; Pomposiello et al. , 2001 ; Chollet et al. , 2002 , 2004 ; Giró et al. , 2006 ; Lee et al. , 2009 ) . 
Due to the high structural similarity among these proteins , genes under their control have been denominated the mar/sox / rob regulon , which present a DNA-binding consensus sequence at their promoter regions , denominated the marsox box which is degenerate and asymmetrical ( AYnGCACnnWnnRYYAAAY ) , and has been detected at various locations on the chromosome of E. coli ( Martin et al. , 2008 ; Aono et al. , 1998 ; Martin et al. , 1999 , 2000 ; Martin & Rosner , 2002 ) . 
These binding sites are also configured in a specific orientation and relative distance to the upstream 235 and 210 elements , to which RNA polymerase binds ( Martin & Rosner , 2002 ; Selke et al. , 2007 ) . 
Previous work in our laboratory determined that ompW is regulated by SoxS in response to paraquat , and a marsox box has been defined at its promoter region with the sequence 59-TTTGCATAGCGTGAATATGTCAAAATTGAT-39 ( Gil et al. , 2009 ) . 
Since the binding sites of the members of the mar/sox/rob regulon are similar , in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium Rob and MarA might also regulate ompW in response to menadione , another superoxide-generating compound ( Kato et al. , 1994 ) . 
In the present work , we evaluated the effect of menadione on ompW expression and the role of MarA and SoxS in the response . 
To evaluate the changes after exposure to menadione , we determined the transcript and protein levels of OmpW in the different genetic backgrounds after exposure to the toxic compound . 
In the wild-type and Drob strains , ompW was upregulated in response to menadione , while deletion of MarA or SoxS abolished the regulation . 
Bioinformatic analyses predicted the presence of three potential marsox boxes at the ompW promoter region , including the one previously described by Gil et al. ( 2009 ) . 
Using transcriptional fusions and electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) with the wild-type and mutated promoter regions we demonstrated that two of the predicted sites were functional . 
Interestingly , in a double marA soxS mutant strain ompW transcript levels were lowered after menadione exposure , and only complementation in trans with both genes was able to restore the positive regulation observed in the wild-type strain . 
In conclusion , we demonstrated that in response to menadione , MarA and SoxS cooperatively regulate ompW through a direct interaction with the promoter region . 
METHODS
Bacterial strains and growth conditions . 
Salmonella strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . 
Bacteria were grown routinely at 37 uC in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth with shaking . 
When required , LB was supplemented with ampicillin ( 100 mg l ) or kanamycin 21 ( 50 mg l ) . 
Solid medium included 15 g agar l . 
When necessary , 21 21 growth medium was treated with menadione ( 50 mM ) . 
Bioinformatic analysis . 
Bioinformatic analyses in search for marsox boxes at the ompW promoter region were performed using the Vector NTI software using the sequences described by Martin et al. ( 1999 ) and Gil et al. ( 2009 ) . 
Construction and cloning of strains . 
For the construction of the double mutant strains we used bacteriophage P22 HT105/1 int 2201 using one single-mutant strain as the donor and the other as the recipient ( Ebel-Tsipis et al. , 1972 ) . 
The presence of substitution mutations was confirmed by PCR using specific primers ( Table 2 ) . 
Genetic complementation of the DsoxS , DmarA , Drob and DmarA soxS strains was performed using plasmids pBR322-soxS , pBR322-marA , pBR322-rob and pBR322-marA-soxS , respectively . 
To generate these plasmids , S. enterica serovar Typhimurium soxS , marA and rob genes were amplified by PCR using primers listed in Table 2 . 
The PCR was performed under the following conditions : 10 min at 95 uC , followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 uC , 45 s at 55 uC and 1 min at 72 uC , and a final extension of 10 min at 72 uC . 
The restriction sites ( EcoRI and BamHI ) at the ends of the DNA fragment were introduced in the PCR primers ( sequences in bold type in Table 2 ) and were digested with the corresponding enzymes . 
The digested PCR product was cloned into the multiple cloning site ( MCS ) of pBR322 . 
To generate plasmid pBR322-marA -- soxS primers pBR322_MarAR_EcoRI_Fw with pBR322 _ MarAR_complsoxS_Rv and pBR322_SoxS_complmarA_Fw with pBR322 _ SoxS_BamHI_Rv ( Table 2 ) were used to generate overlapping PCR products spanning the divergent construct marA -- soxS , taking advantage of the complementary sequence added ( sequences in italic type in Table 2 ) . 
The resulting PCR products were used as templates in a second reaction with primers pBR322_MarAR_EcoRI_Fw and pBR322_SoxS_BamHI_Rv to generate the divergent construct , which was digested and cloned into the MCS of plasmid pBR322 . 
RNA isolation and mRNA detection . 
An overnight bacterial culture was diluted 100-fold with fresh LB medium and was grown at 37 uC with shaking to OD600 ~ 0.4 . 
The culture was split into two 10 ml aliquots and one of them was incubated with 50 mM menadione . 
Cells were grown at 37 uC and 4 ml aliquots were withdrawn 20 min after menadione exposure . 
Total RNA was extracted using the GenElute Total RNA purification kit ( Sigma ) following the manufacturer 's 
Table 1 .

Total RNA was treated with 2 U DNase I to remove trace amounts of DNA . 
cDNA synthesis was carried out at 37 uC for 1 h in 25 ml of a mixture that contained 2.5 pmol of the specific primers , 10 ml template RNA ( 5 mg ) , 0.2 mM dNTPs , 1 ml sterile water , 4 ml 56 buffer [ 250 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.3 , 375 mM KCl , 15 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM DTT , 40 U RNasin and 200 U MMLV reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) ] . 
Relative quantification of the transcript levels of ompW , marA , rob and soxS by real-time RT-PCR ( qRT-PCR ) was performed using the Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Reagent kit and the Mx3000P detection system ( Stratagene ) . 
16S rRNA levels were used for normalization . 
The qRT-PCR mixture ( 20 ml ) contained 1 ml cDNA template and 120 nM of each primer [ ompW_RT_Fw and ompW_RT_Rv for the ompW gene , marA_RT_Fw and marA_RT_Rv for the marA gene , soxS_RT_Fw and soxS_RT_Rv for the soxS gene , rob_RT_Fw and rob_RT_Rv for the rob gene , and 16S_RT_Fw and 16S_RT_Rv for the 16S rRNA gene ( 16S ) ( Table 2 ) ] . 
The qRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions : 10 min at 95 uC , followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 uC , 45 s at 53 uC and 30 s at 72 uC , followed by a melting cycle from 53 to 95 uC to check for amplification specificity . 
A standard quantification curve with serial dilutions of RTPCR products was constructed for each gene to calculate the amplification efficiency . 
These values were used to obtain the ratio between the gene of interest and the expression of the 16S rRNA gene as described by Pfaffl ( 2001 ) . 
All experiments were performed in three biological and technical replicates .

Protein purification . 
Briefly , E. coli BL21 cells harbouring plasmid pET-TOPO-soxS or marA were grown in 500 ml LB medium supplemented with ampicillin ( 100 mg ml ) to OD600 ~ 0.4 and 21 protein overexpression was carried out by adding 1 mM IPTG with further growth for 6 h. His-tagged SoxS and MarA used in EMSAs were purified as previously described ( Collao et al. , 2012 ) . 
Immunoblot analysis . 
Immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG M2 mAb ( Sigma ) detected a 36FLAG-containing fusion protein . 
Strains carrying the epitope-tagged construct were grown at 37 uC with shaking to OD600 ~ 0.4 . 
The culture was split into two 10 ml aliquots , one of which was incubated with 50 mM menadione . 
Cultures were grown at 37 uC and after 20 min of exposure cells were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 3 min . 
Bacterial pellets were suspended in 100 mM Tris / HCl ( pH 8.0 ) and subjected to three rounds of sonication of 30 s each . 
After centrifuging at 13 000 g for 5 min , the pelleted material was subjected to SDS-PAGE and size-separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes , incubated with antiFLAG antibody M2 ( 1 : 1000 dilution ) upon which the FLAG epitope was detected with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and peroxidase activity .

Construction of transcriptional fusions with the reporter gene lacZ . 
The native ompW promoter region from positions +1 to 2600 ( with respect to the translation start site ) was amplified by PCR with primers pLacZ_OmpW_2600_Fw and pLacZ_OmpW _ +1 _ Rv using genomic DNA from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium as a template ( strain 14028s ) . 
The restriction sites ( KpnI and HindIII , respectively ) at the ends of the DNA fragment were introduced by the PCR primers ( underlined sequences in Table 2 ) and were digested with the corresponding enzymes . 
The digested PCR product was cloned into the MCS of the b-galactosidase reporter vector pLacZ-Basic ( GenBank accession no . 
U13184 ) ( Clontech ) , generating plasmid pompW-lacZ . 
To generate plasmids pMutA-lacZ , pMutB-lacZ and pMutC-lacZ , primers ompW_pLacZ _ -600 Fw with pOmpW_MUTA_Rv , pOmpW_MUTB_Rv or pOmpW_MUTC_Rv and ompW_pLacZ _ +1 _ Rv with pOmpW_MUTA_Fw , pOmpW_MUTB_Fw or pOmpW_MUTC_Fw ( Table 2 ) were used to generate overlapping PCR products spanning the whole length of the ompW promoter . 
The PCR was performed under the following conditions : 5 min at 95 uC , followed by 10 cycles of 30 s at 94 uC , 30 s at 40 uC and 2 min at 72 uC , followed by 10 u u u cycles of 30 s at 94 C , 30 s at 45 C and 2 min at 72 C , and 20 cycles of 30 s at 94 uC , 30 s at 50 uC and 2 min at 72 uC , and a final extension of 10 min at 72 uC . 
The resulting PCR products were used as templates in a second reaction with primers pLacZ_OmpW_2600Fw and pLacZ_OmpW _ +1 Rv to generate the mutated ompW promoter , which was digested and cloned into the MCS of plasmid pLacZ-Basic . 
PCR conditions were 10 min at 95 uC , followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 uC , u u u 30 s at 55 C and 1 min at 72 C , and a final extension of 10 min at 72 C. Mutation of other sites was generated the same way , generating plasmids pMutAB-lacZ , pMutAC-lacZ , pMutBC-lacZ and pMutABC-lacZ . 
Constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing . 
The constructs were transformed into strain 14028s . 
To evaluate activity , cells at OD600 ~ 0.4 were grown for 20 min in the presence of 50 mM menadione . 
Control cells received no treatment . 
b-Galactosidase activity was determined as previously described by Gil et al. ( 2007 ) . 
Relative transcript level 
EMSA . 
To study protein binding to the promoter region of ompW , a non-radioactive EMSA was performed according to the protocol described by De la Cruz et al. ( 2007 ) . 
The probes were obtained by PCR using specific primers pLacZ_OmpW_2600Fw and pLacZ_OmpW _ +1 Rv to amplify the promoter region of ompW ( 600 bp ) and pOmpW _ +1 _ Fw with pOmpW _ +130 _ Rv ( Table 2 ) for the negative control encompassing the coding region of ompW ( 130 bp ) . 
The PCR was performed under the following conditions : 10 min at 95 uC , followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 uC , 30 s at 55 uC and 1 min at 72 uC , and a final extension of 10 min at 72 uC . 
PCR products used in EMSAs with mutations in the mar/sox/rob boxes A , B and C were generated using primers pLacZ_OmpW _ -600 Fw and pLacZ_OmpW _ +1 Rv , and plasmids pMutAB-lacZ , pMutAC-lacZ , pMutBC-lacZ and pMutABC-lacZ as templates . 
Both the promoter region and the negative control ( ~ 2 ng ml ) were mixed with 21 increasing amounts of purified MarA or SoxS in the presence of binding buffer [ 20 mM HEPES , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , 0.1 mM EDTA , 20 % ( v/v ) glycerol ] . 
The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and loaded on a native 6 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.56 Tris/borate -- EDTA buffer . 
The DNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining on a UV transilluminator . 
All primers used in this work were designed using the Vector NTI 10 Software . 
RESULTS
In order to evaluate the effect of menadione on the expression of ompW , we analysed the transcript levels in a S. enterica serovar Typhimurium wild-type strain treated with the toxic compound . 
As shown in Fig. 1 ( a ) , ompW transcript levels were increased ( 20.22 ± 1.70 fold changes ) as compared with control untreated cells . 
To correlate the changes in the levels of transcripts with the gene product OmpW ( ~ 21 kDa ) and evaluate possible post-transcrip-tional regulation , we constructed translational fusions in the wild-type strain and evaluated their levels as described in Methods . 
In agreement with qRT-PCR analysis , OmpW levels were increased as compared with those of untreated cells ( Fig. 1b ) . 
ompW is positively regulated by MarA and SoxS 
We previously demonstrated that SoxS positively regulates ompW in response to paraquat ( Gil et al. , 2009 ) . 
Since MarA , SoxS and Rob co-regulate several genes ( Martin & Rosner , 2002 ) , we evaluated ompW transcript levels in the different genetic backgrounds by qRT-PCR after exposure to menadione . 
As shown in Fig. 2a , b , in strains DmarA and DsoxS the transcript levels were decreased after exposure to menadione ( 0.27 ± 0.08 and 0.17 ± 0.01 fold changes , respectively , versus a 20-fold increase in wild-type cells exposed to the toxic compound ) . 
In contrast , in the rob mutant strain they were upregulated to similar levels as those found in the wild-type strain after the treatment ( 11.42 ± 0.52 fold change , Fig . 
S1a , available with the online version of this paper ) . 
As expected , in trans complementation of strains DmarA and DsoxS restored the positive regulation observed in the wild-type strain ( Fig. 2a , b ) .

To further confirm our result , we generated translational fusions of ompW in the DmarA and DsoxS genetic backgrounds and determined the protein levels by performing a Western blot . 
As shown in Fig S1 ( a ) , the positive regulation observed in the wild-type strain after menadione treatment was retained in the Drob strain ( Fig S1b ) , while in DmarA and DsoxS strains it was abolished ( Fig. 2a -- c ) . 
Taken together , qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses suggest that MarA and SoxS are required to positively regulate ompW in response to menadione , while Rob is not involved in this response .

MarA and SoxS bind to the ompW promoter region
To evaluate if the regulation of ompW by MarA and SoxS was due to a direct interaction , we performed EMSAs to determine if the purified proteins were able to bind to its promoter region . 
The bioinformatic analysis predicted the presence of three putative mar/sox/rob boxes ( Fig. 3a ) , two novel ones named MS-A and MS-B , in addition to the previously identified SoxS-binding site ( MS-C ) described by Gil et al. ( 2009 ) . 
All three binding sites presented the two characteristic elements described at marsox boxes , CWA and the highly conserved GCAY ( Li & Demple , 1994 ) , which are required for the stability of the interaction and for protein binding , respectively ( Li & Demple , 1996 ) . 
To confirm the interactions , we performed EMSAs using a PCR product spanning the promoter region from positions 2600 to +1 with respect to the transcription start site , with increasing concentrations of purified MarA or SoxS . 
As a negative control , a PCR product that included a region from +1 to +130 of ompW was used . 
Both MarA and SoxS were able to bind to the wild-type promoter ( Fig. 3c , d ) , although at different concentrations . 
MarA generated a change in the electrophoretic mobility at a concentration of 100 nM , while SoxS required 400 nM ( Fig. 3c , d , respectively , fragment A ) . 
Mutation of the GCAY element to AAAY ( Fig. 3a ) in the three predicted boxes required doubling of the amount of both MarA and SoxS to generate a shift in the electrophoretic mobility as compared with that of the wild-type promoter , while mutating MS-A and MS-C together completely abolished the interaction with both proteins ( Fragments F and H , Fig. 3c , d ) , suggesting that they are required for binding in vitro .

The promoter region of ompW has two functional marsox boxes 
To determine which marsox boxes were functional in vivo , we constructed transcriptional fusions of the ompW promoter region with the fragments used for EMSAs , schematized in Fig. 3 ( a ) . 
The different constructs were transformed into strain 14028s and b-galactosidase activity was measured . 
All activities were compared with that of strain 14028s with the wild-type construct ( A ) . 
Cells containing the wild-type promoter ( A ) or MS-B mutated ( C ) showed a twofold increase in b-galactosidase activity after exposure to the toxic compound ( Fig. 3b ) , indicating that MS-B is dispensable for ompW upregulation by MarA and SoxS in response to menadione . 
However , individually mutating MS-A and MS-C or mutating both together resulted in no regulation after exposure to the toxic compound ( Fig. 3b , fragments B , D , E , F , G and H ) , indicating that both sites are required for the positive regulation by MarA and SoxS in strain 14028s , results which are in agreement with those from EMSAs .

Both MarA and SoxS are required for ompW positive regulation
To determine whether MarA and SoxS individually regulated ompW in response to menadione or if they were both required , we generated a double DmarA soxS strain and measured ompW transcript levels in the presence or absence of menadione . 
As observed in the individual mutants , ompW levels remained decreased in the DmarA soxS strain after treatment with the toxic compound ( 0.29 ± 0.05 fold change , Fig. 4 ) . 
When the double mutant strain was complemented in trans with a plasmid carrying the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium soxS or marA gene ( DmarA soxS/pB322-soxS and DmarA soxS/pB322-marA , respectively ) , the transcript levels remained decreased after menadione treatment ( 0.354 ± 0.1 and 0.314 ± 0.06 fold change , respectively , Fig. 4 ) . 
In contrast , when the double mutant strain was complemented with a plasmid coding for both marA and soxS ( DmarA soxS/pB322-marA _ soxS ) , the positive regulation was partially restored to levels similar to those observed in the wild-type strain exposed to menadione ( 6.81 ± 1.13 fold change , Fig. 4 ) , indicating that both MarA and SoxS are required for positive regulation .

MarA and SoxS work cooperatively
Since both MarA and SoxS were required to positively regulate ompW , we hypothesized that the two proteins might act cooperatively . 
To evaluate this possibility , we performed EMSAs with the ompW promoter mutated at MS-B ( fragment C , Fig. 3a ) , constant amounts of either MarA ( Fig. 5a ) or SoxS ( Fig. 5b ) , and increasing amounts of the corresponding counterpart . 
When MarA remained constant ( 200 nM ) , adding increasing amounts of SoxS , from 0.0125 to 0.8 mM , resulted in a shift to a higher molecular mass than that generated by the individual proteins ( Fig. 5a ) . 
Interestingly , even at the lower concentrations of SoxS ( 0.0125 mM ) the high-molecular-mass complex was observed , while incubating with SoxS alone required 0.4 mM to produce a shift using the same 
DNA probe ( Fig. 3b , fragment C ) , suggesting that the affinity of SoxS for the promoter region of ompW increases in the presence of MarA . 
In agreement with this , using a constant amount of SoxS ( 0.8 mM ) and increasing amounts of MarA ( 33 -- 200 nM ) resulted in a similar shift with a higher molecular mass to that observed for the individual proteins ( Fig. 5b ) . 
As observed for SoxS , lower levels of MarA were required to form the high-molecular-mass complex ( 100 nM ) than when the protein was incubated alone with the ompW promoter ( 200 nM ) , suggesting the same increased affinity for the promoter region as observed in the case of SoxS . 
Taken together , our results indicate that both MarA and SoxS are required to positively regulate ompW and that they cooperatively bind to the promoter region .

DISCUSSION
The OmpW protein is an immunogenic 22 kDa ( Jalajakumari & Manning , 1990 ) minor porin and has been related to osmoprotection ( Hu et al. , 2005 ) , the efflux and resistance towards paraquat ( Gil et al. , 2009 ) and the influx of hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid ( Morales et al. , 2012 ) . 
It is regulated by diverse envir-onmental conditions including temperature , salinity , nutrient availability , oxygen levels ( Nandi et al. , 2005 ) , paraquat ( Gil et al. , 2009 ) and reactive oxygen species ( Morales et al. , 2012 ) , among others , and is differentially regulated at the transcriptional level by FNR ( anaerobiosis ) , ArcA ( H O and NaOCl ) and SoxS ( paraquat ) 2 2 ( Bouchal et al. , 2010 ; Morales et al. , 2012 ; Gil et al. , 2009 ) . 
In this work , we demonstrate that both SoxS and MarA , whose response overlap and together co-regulate over 40 genes ( Aono et al. , 1998 ; Martin et al. , 1999 , 2000 ; Martin & Rosner , 2002 ) , were required for the positive regulation of ompW after menadione treatment ( Figs 2 and 4 ) . 
Consistent with this , both transcription factors are upregulated in response to the toxic compound ( Fig S2 ) , and SoxS is required to regulate ompW in response to paraquat ( Gil et al. , 2009 ) . 
Our results indicate that there are two functional mar/sox boxes that are required for the positive regulation in response to menadione ( Fig. 3 ) . 
These sites are located approximately 100 nt upstream from the ArcA-binding site ( from 270 to 255 ) , required for the negative regulation in response to H2O2 and NaOCl ( Morales et al. , 2012 ) . 
This suggests that under the assayed conditions , ArcA is not active , since , as observed in the presence of NaOCl , when ArcA , MarA and SoxS are present , ompW is negatively regulated . 
It is plausible to speculate that under those conditions ArcA could bind to the 235 element and impede binding of the sigma factor , explaining why , although both MarA and SoxS are present , ompW is negatively regulated . 
In contrast , in response to menadione ArcA could be inactive , allowing MarA and SoxS to exert their regulation , although this has not been evaluated .

Our results indicate that Rob is not involved in the regulation of ompW ( Fig . 
S1 ) , indicating that it is regulated in a different manner as compared with other genes that are members of the extensively studied mar/sox/rob regulon , like tolC in E. coli , which is positively regulated by all of them in response to salicylate , paraquat and 2,29-dipyridyl ( Zhang et al. , 2008 ) . 
In addition , previous work indicates that rob is repressed by MarA due to steric hindrance and in E. coli SoxS modulates its expression in response to paraquat ( McMurry & Levy , 2010 ; Michán et al. , 2002 ) . 
Furthermore , studies in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium showed that the transcript and protein levels of marA and soxS are increased , while those of rob are lowered in a wild-type strain treated with sodium hypochlorite ( Collao et al. , 2012 ) , suggesting a similar mechanism . 
To investigate the mechanism by which MarA and SoxS regulate ompW , we performed EMSAs and used transcriptional fusions of the promoter region ( Figs 3 and 5 ) . 
Our results indicate that both proteins are required for positive regulation and that they act in a cooperative manner ( Figs 4 and 5 ) . 
In this context , several reports provide evidence that two transcription factors work cooperatively in response to the same signal , as in Vibrio vulnificus , where the nan operon is negatively regulated by CRP and NanR in the presence of N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate ( Kim et al. , 2011 ) . 
Also , in E. coli CRP requires the presence of RhaR to efficiently activate rhaSR in vivo in response to Lrhamnose ( Wickstrum et al. , 2005 ) . 
Similarly , studies in Haemophilus influenzae suggest that CRP and SiaR regulate their respective operators by simultaneously binding to an intergenic region between nan and siaPT , where SiaR functions as both a repressor and activator , using glucosamine-6-phosphate as a co-activator , and interacts with CRP to regulate these divergent promoters ( Johnston et al. , 2010 ) . 
Furthermore , in Myxococcus xanthus MrPC2 and FruA bind cooperatively to three sites at the fmgE promoter region , and it has been proposed that one site is necessary to recruit MrpC2 and FruA to the promoter , while the other two are required to activate it ( Son et al. , 2011 ) . 
However , most of these studies mainly show that the effect on the target genes is synergic . 
In contrast , our results indicate that MarA and SoxS are required to positively modulate ompW expression ( Figs 4 and 5 ) . 
To our knowledge , this is the first report demonstrating such an effect . 
Further studies addressing whether this is a common feature of regulation of gene expression by MarA and SoxS , novel targets subject to similar regulation , and the mechanism by which these proteins interact are under examination in our laboratory .
