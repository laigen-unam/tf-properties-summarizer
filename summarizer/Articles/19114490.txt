The T-POP transposon was employed in a general screen for tetracycline ( Tet ) - induced chromosomal loci that exhibited Tet-activated or Tet-repressed expression of a ﬂiC-lac transcriptional fusion . 
Insertions that activated ﬂagellar transcription were located in ﬂagellar genes . 
T-POP insertions that exhibited Tet-dependent ﬂiC-lac inhibition were isolated upstream of the ecnR , ﬁmZ , pefI-srgD , rcsB , and ydiV genes and in the ﬂagellar gene ﬂgA , which is located upstream of the anti- 28 factor gene ﬂgM . 
When expressed from the chromosomal ParaBAD promoter , EcnR , FimZ , PefI-SrgD , and RcsB inhibited the transcription of the ﬂagellar class 1 ﬂhDC operon . 
YdiV , which is weakly homologous to EAL domain proteins involved in cyclic-di-GMP regulation , appears to act at a step after class 1 transcription . 
By using a series of deletions of the regulatory genes to try to disrupt each pathway , these regulators were found to act largely independently of one another . 
These results identify EcnR and PefI-SrgD as additional components of the complex regulatory network controlling ﬂagellar expression . 
Flagella are rotary propellers that some bacteria use to swim through liquid environments . 
A single ﬂagellum can grow to 10 times the length of the cell and be composed of tens of thousands of protein subunits ( 35 ) . 
Salmonella strains have an average of eight ﬂagella per cell ( 43 ) . 
By enabling bacteria to swim toward nutrients and away from harmful substances , these structures provide bacteria with a competitive advantage . 
The price for this advantage is about 2 % of the cell 's biosynthetic resources in order to build the ﬂagella and 0.1 % of the cell 's energy for their rotation ( 16 , 35 ) . 
Therefore , ﬂagella are likely to be expressed only when they are needed . 
Bacteria upregulate ﬂagellar synthesis under low-nutrient conditions ( 62 , 63 ) . 
Flagellar genes are shut down after attachment to surfaces during bioﬁlm formation ( 2 , 42 ) . 
Flagellar synthesis is inhibited after entry into host cells , which would prevent the recognition of ﬂagellin by the immune system ( 8 , 9 , 14 ) . 
Fla-gella are also regulated in response to temperature , DNA supercoiling , water availability , and other conditions ( 6 , 56 ) . 
The approximately ﬁve dozen genes involved in ﬂagellar synthesis and chemotaxis in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi-murium are organized into a transcriptional hierarchy of three classes . 
At the top of the hierarchy is the class 1 promoter . 
The class 1 promoter is thought to integrate many different signals in the decision on when to express ﬂagellar genes . 
In Salmo-nella , the class 1 promoter contains at least six transcriptional start sites ( 61 ) and expresses the ﬂhDC genes , which encode the FlhD4C2 activator complex ( 34 , 58 ) . 
The FlhD4C2 activator

complex directs 70 and RNA polymerase to initiate transcription at class 2 promoters . 
Gene products expressed from the class 2 promoters are used to build the basal body , which is the motor structure that spans the membranes and peptidoglycan and consists of the rotor , the rod , bushings , and the ﬂagellar secretion system . 
Class 2 gene products are also used to assemble the ﬂexible , extracellular rod-ﬁlament linker called the hook . 
A class 2 promoter transcribes the gene for the ﬂagellar sigma factor 28 , which activates transcription from class 3 promoters . 
Class 3 promoters transcribe the genes for the ﬁlament subunits , motor force generators , and chemosensory system ( 6 ) . 
In Salmonella , a number of nonﬂagellar proteins are known to affect ﬂagellar synthesis . 
These regulators include eight proteins that contain DNA-binding domains . 
One is the cyclic AMP-catabolite gene activator protein ( CAP ) complex that activates ﬂhDC transcription ( 27 , 28 , 30 , 62 ) . 
CAP binds DNA when cyclic AMP levels are high during growth under nutrient-limiting conditions . 
In Escherichia coli , DNA footprinting dem-onstrated previously that CAP binds to a speciﬁc site within the ﬂhDC promoter region ( 49 ) . 
A second regulator of ﬂagellar transcription is RcsB , which is the response regulator component of the phosphotransfer relay system that controls capsule synthesis ( 5 , 11 ) . 
The RcsCDB system responds to multiple external stimuli , including high osmolarity , desiccation , and low temperature with high zinc concentrations ( 36 ) . 
RcsB binds to a speciﬁc site termed the RcsAB box within the class 1 promoter region to inhibit motility ( 57 ) . 
A third DNA-bind-ing protein that affects motility is FimZ . 
FimZ is a response regulator that activates type 1 ﬁmbrial genes . 
Type 1 ﬁmbriae are utilized for surface adhesion , but it is not known to what signals FimZ responds . 
FimZ inhibits motility at the level of class 1 transcription ( 7 ) . 
The iron-regulatory protein Fur and the nucleoid proteins Fis and H-NS activate ﬂagellar transcription ( 4 , 25 , 28 ) . 
It has been demonstrated previously for Fis in Salmonella and for Fur and H-NS in E. coli that these regulators can bind directly to the ﬂhDC promoter ( 25 , 49 , 51 ) . 
Finally , SlyA and RtsB are pathogenesis-related DNA-binding proteins that affect motility or ﬂagellar expression ( 13 , 50 ) . 
SlyA promotes the expression of the ﬁlament subunits ( 50 ) , and RtsB binds to and inhibits the class 1 ﬂagellar promoter ( 13 ) . 
Proteins that do not contain DNA-binding domains also regulate motility in Salmonella and tend to affect steps after class 1 transcription . 
CsrA is an RNA-binding protein involved in carbon storage regulation that stabilizes the ﬂhDC transcript in E. coli ( 59 ) and is important for motility in Salmonella ( 32 ) . 
DnaK is a heat shock response chaperone that directly interacts with FlhD4C2 to promote the formation of active FlhD4C2 complexes ( 52 ) . 
ClpXP is a protease that is also induced by the heat shock response but inhibits motility by degrading FlhD C 4 2 ( 9 , 54 , 55 ) . 
Proteins that adjust the levels of or respond to the global signaling molecule cyclic-di-GMP ( c-di-GMP ) also affect motility . 
The GGDEF domain protein AdrA increases c-di-GMP levels , reduces motility , and promotes bioﬁlm formation ( 47 ) . 
The EAL domain proteins YhjH and STM1827 decrease c-di-GMP levels , increase motility , and inhibit bioﬁlm formation ( 45 -- 47 ) . 
The YcgR protein inhibits motility and contains a PilZ domain that binds c-di-GMP ( 46 ) . 
In E. coli , these c-di-GMP-related proteins have been shown to promote the assembly of the motor force generator proteins and alter the directional bias of ﬂagellar rotation ( 19 , 26 ) . 
Because ﬂagella can be an advantage or a handicap depending on the situation , it is not surprising that ﬂagellar synthesis is regulated in response to many different signals . 
However , the more than a dozen proteins described above may not constitute the entire regulatory network in Salmonella . 
A genetic approach was utilized in this study to search for additional regulators of ﬂagellar synthesis . 
The T-POP transposon , which contains an inducible promoter , was allowed to transpose to random locations throughout the Salmonella genome . 
Depending on the orientation of the transposon , the inducible promoter could initiate the transcription of adjacent genes or produce antisense RNA to inhibit translation . 
This transposon was used to screen for genes that either inducibly activated or inhibited the transcription of the ﬁlament subunit gene ﬂiC . 
In addition to insertions that directly controlled known regulators of ﬂagellar transcription , two new loci were found to inhibit ﬂagellar synthesis when overexpressed . 
Deletions in and lac fusions to these negative regulator genes were used to organize the corresponding proteins into pathways . 
These additional regulators provide further insight into when and how ﬂagellar synthesis is controlled .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and general techniques . 
The strains used in this study were derived from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 . 
Many of these strains are listed in Table 1 . 
Additional strains were constructed from the alleles indicated in Table 1 and are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material . 
Cultures of bacterial strains and phage P22 lysates were prepared as described previously ( 18 ) . 
Chlortetracycline ( 50 g/ml ; autoclaved ) or tetracycline ( Tet ; 15 g/ml ) was used to induce transcription from the tetA promoter within the T-POP transposon , and 0.2 % arabinose ( Ara ) was used to induce transcription from the araBAD promoter . 
Tets selections and transductions were performed as described previously ( 37 , 38 ) , except that Luria broth ( LB ) was used instead of nutrient broth . 
Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies ( Coralville , IA ) and are listed in Table S2 in the supplemental material . 
PCR products were sequenced at the DNA sequencing facility ( Department of Biochemistry ) at the University of Washington or at the DNA sequencing core facility at the University of Utah . 
Strain constructions utilizing red recombination were performed using plasmid pKD46 as described previously ( 60 ) . 
MES ( morpholineethanesulfonic acid ) buffer ( 100 mM ) was used in acidic motility plates to maintain the pH near 5.1 ( 39 ) . 
A position-speciﬁc score matrix algorithm was used to search intergenic regions with the consensus sequences for 28 and FlhD4C2 , as described in an earlier study ( 60 ) . 
Screen for random T-POP insertions affecting ﬂagellar transcription . 
The screen was performed as described in Results . 
The T-POP transposon was mobilized by P22-mediated transduction into recipient strains expressing Tn10 transposase from a plasmid . 
The frequency of hot-spot transposition was reduced by using the mutant Tn10 transposase with altered target speciﬁcity from plasmid pNK2880 . 
To compensate for the decreased transposition frequency of the mutant transposase with altered target speciﬁcity , the donor strain ( TH3923 ) had the Tn10dTc [ 25 ] transposon inserted downstream from a Mud-P22 insertion in an F plasmid . 
Because an induced Mud-P22 packages primarily adjacent chromosomal DNA , 10 to 50 % of the phage particles should carry the T-POP DNA sequence ( 33 ) . 
The screen was undertaken by undergraduate students , graduate students , and postdoctoral fellows in a number of genetics classes . 
We roughly estimate that a half million transposon insertions were screened for inducible expression of the ﬂiC-lac transcriptional fusion . 
Arbitrary PCR and sequencing were used to identify individual T-POP insertions ( 33 ) . 
Many of the insertions that showed linkage to markers near ﬁmZ , rcsB , and ydiV by P22 transduction were not considered further . 
Isolation of MudJ insertions . 
Transposon insertions of the MudJ transcriptional reporter were isolated near the PecnR : : T-POP insertion in strain TH9291 , the feoB : : T-POP insertion in strain TH9293 , the PpefI : : T-POP insertion in strain TH8774 , and the rcsD : : T-POP insertion in strain TH8758 . 
Random MudJ insertions were generated ( 22 ) , and between 24,000 and 90,000 colonies were pooled for each strain . 
Phage stocks were prepared on the pooled colonies . 
A wild-type strain ( TH437 ) was transduced with these pools of random insertions , and the cells were spread onto LB-Tet-kanamycin ( Kan ) - EGTA plates to select for transductions that had brought in the T-POP insertion ( by selecting for Tetr ) and nearby MudJ insertions ( by selecting for MudJ-encoded Kanr ) . 
To screen for MudJ lac fusions under the control of the tetA promoter in the T-POP , transductants were patched onto lactose indicator medium ( LB -- X-Gal [ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl - - D-galactopyranoside ] , MacConkey agar-lactose [ Mac-Lac ] , or triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-lactose ) containing either chlortetracycline or no inducer . 
To screen for MudJ insertions that blocked the inhibition of motility , transductants were poked into Tet-Kan-EGTA motility plates . 
The locations of insertions linked to ecnR , pefI-srgD , and rcsB were determined by PCR and sequencing . 
For feoB , transposons were checked for linkage to the feoB : : T-POP insertion regardless of the strains ' motility or their Lac phenotypes . 
The left ends of linked MudJ insertions were identiﬁed using arbitrary PCR and sequencing as described previously ( 33 ) , except that primer Mud-R3 ( AGCAATTTTTTACTATCTTTC GCG ) was used for the primary reaction and primer Mud-R4 ( TTTGCACTA CAGGCTTGCAAGCCC ) was used for the secondary reaction and for sequencing . 
The isolation of MudJ transposons in E. coli F plasmid genes ybiB and ycbB indicated that F plasmid DNA had transferred into the feoB gene . 
Through PCR and sequencing , the F plasmid junctions were located . 
The left end ( tetA side ) of the T-POP was inserted 82 bp downstream from the start of ybjA , with PtetA transcribing toward the start codon . 
The right end ( tetR side ) of the T-POP was inserted 73 bp downstream from the start of ybjA , with PtetR transcribing toward the stop codon . 
A junction that fused F plasmid DNA 3,149 bp after the start of ycbB to F plasmid DNA 11 bp after the end of ybhB was also sequenced . 
Altogether , 6,016 bp of F plasmid DNA ﬂanked by T-POPs had transposed into feoB . 
A transposon insertion of the MudJ transcriptional reporter into a ﬁmbrial gene was also isolated . 
Random MudJ insertions were generated in strain TH8757 . 
Strain TH13235 ( PﬁmZ : : T-POP araBAD : : ﬁmZ ) was transduced with a phage stock prepared on 180,000 pooled colonies . 
Tet-sensitive plates containing Kan were used to select for MudJ insertions that had replaced PﬁmZ : : T-POP . 
Insertions in ﬁmbrial genes could be distinguished on lactose indicator media by looking for an increase in lac expression when ﬁmZ was induced from the arabinose promoter . 
Arbitrary PCR and sequencing were used to locate the left end of a MudJ insertion in ﬁmH . 
Expression of genes at the ara locus . 
Genes were placed under the control of the arabinose promoter at the ara locus by amplifying the coding sequence and then using red recombination to replace araBAD : : tetRA in TH6706 with the ampliﬁed DNA . 
Primers were designed with about 40 bp of homology to the arabinose locus ( for recombination ) and about 20 bp of homology to the clone gene ( for ampliﬁcation ) . 
These constructs replaced the sequence spanning the araB start codon through the araD stop codon with that spanning the start codon through the stop codon of the cloned gene . 
Tet-sensitive plates were used to select for recombinants following red recombination . 
In the case of pefI-srgD , a 250-bp sequence of DNA starting upstream of pefI and continuing through 14 bp after the stop codon of srgD was used to replace the ribosome-binding site from 13 bp upstream of the araB start codon through the stop codon of araD ( resulting in strain TH12196 ) . 
To delete pefI from this construct , a tetRA cassette was inserted ( generating strain TH14897 ) and then replaced with a clean deletion of pefI ( producing strain TH14945 ) . 
Other P : : pefI-srgD variants that began ara with the pefI start codon or ended 193 bp after srgD were constructed . 
Construction of deletions . 
Genes were deleted using the FLP recombination target ( FRT ) - Kan-FRT cassette ( FKF ) or the FRT-chloramphenicol-FRT cassette ( FCF ) as described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 10 ) . 
FKF and FCF insertiondeletion alleles were constructed in strain TH4702 and designed to leave 10 codons at the beginning and end of each gene intact . 
Kanr or chloramphenicolresistant colonies were selected , and the location of each insertion was conﬁrmed by PCR . 
Motility plates . 
Motility plates were prepared as described previously ( 18 ) . 
Single colonies were poked into the plates using toothpicks , and the plates were incubated for 6 or 24 h. For motility assays requiring the induction of a T-POP or Para construct , colonies were picked from plates that contained Tet or arabinose , respectively . 
At least six independent colonies were checked for each strain assayed . 
Adobe Photoshop was used to adjust the levels for pictures of motility plates in order to increase the contrast between the swarms and the background . 
- Galactosidase assays . 
Ten microliters of an overnight culture ( in LB , LB-Ara , LB-Ara-Tet , or LB-chlortetracycline ) was subcultured into 3 ml of fresh medium ( LB , LB-Ara , LB-Ara-Tet , or LB-chlortetracycline ) . 
Tubes were incubated with shaking at 37 °C until the contents reached a mid-log-phase density of 60 Klett units , which corresponds to an optical density at 600 nm of about 0.6 . 
Cultures were put on ice , spun down , and resuspended in 3 ml of cold buffered saline . 
Culture samples of between 50 l and 0.5 ml were added to 0.55 ml of complete Z-buffer ( Z-buffer plus 5 l of 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate and 100 l of chloroform ) ( 37 ) and adjusted to give a total aqueous volume of 1.05 ml with buffered saline . 
The assay was continued as described previously ( 37 ) . 
For each strain , assays were performed for three independent biological replicates .

RESULTS
Isolation of T-POP insertion mutations that induce or inhibit ﬂagellar gene transcription . 
Strain TH4881 ( pNK2880 [ pTn10-tpnase Ampr ats-l ats-2 ] ﬂiC5050 : : MudJ ﬂjB5001 : : MudCm ) was mutagenized with the T-POP transposon Tn10dTc [ 25 ] , which is a derivative of Tn10 . 
The T-POP contains the tetA and tetR genes needed for resistance to Tet and forms stable insertions because it lacks the transposase gene . 
In the T-POP transposon Tn10dTc [ 25 ] , the transcription terminator region of the tetA transcript is deleted . 
Insertions of this T-POP element into the chromosome result in Tet-inducible transcription from the tetA promoter into adjacent chromosomal DNA ( 44 ) . 
A transcriptional fusion of the lac operon to the 28-dependent ﬂiC gene ( ﬂiC5050 : : MudJ ) was present in the recipient strain as a reporter to screen for Tet-dependent changes in ﬂagellar transcription . 
Strains expressing the ﬂiC-lac fusions grew as Lac ( red ) colonies on Mac-Lac indicator me-dium . 
Following transposition , four classes of T-POP insertion mutants were obtained based on their phenotypes on Mac-Lac and Mac-Lac-Tet media . 
( i ) The majority of T-POP insertion mutants displayed a Lac phenotype on both Mac-Lac and Mac-Lac-Tet plates , indicating that the transposon insertion had no signiﬁcant effect on ﬂiC-lac transcription . 
( ii ) A small percentage of the T-POP insertion mutants had a Lac ( white ) phenotype on both Mac-Lac and Mac-Lac-Tet plates . 
These mutants carried insertions that themselves resulted in the inhibition of ﬂiC-lac transcription . 
For example , insertions in ﬂagellar genes required for the formation of the hook-basal body ( HBB ) accumulate the anti- 28 factor FlgM , resulting in the inhibition of ﬂiC-lac transcription ( 21 , 29 , 30 ) . 
( iii ) About 0.5 % of the T-POP insertion mutants showed normal ﬂiC-lac transcription on Mac-Lac plates but had a Lac phenotype on Mac-Lac-Tet plates . 
This phenotype indicated that ﬂiC-lac expression was inhibited by the transcription of chromosomal DNA near the T-POP . 
( iv ) About 0.1 % of the insertion mutations resulted in a Lac phenotype on Mac-Lac plates and a Lac phenotype on Mac-Lac-Tet plates . 
In this case , the act of T-POP insertion resulted in the inhibition of the ﬂiC-lac reporter but expression was restored by the transcription of genes adjacent to the site of insertion . 
Mutations in the third and fourth classes , which yielded inducible Lac phenotypes , were analyzed further . 
Characterization of T-POP insertions resulting in Tet-induced Lac phenotypes . 
The fourth class of T-POP insertion mutants that had a Tet-induced Lac phenotype was characterized by DNA sequence analysis . 
In three cases , the T-POP had inserted upstream of the ﬂiAZY operon , upstream of the ﬂiE operon , or 785 bp into the 996-bp ﬂiG gene . 
These insertion mutations were polar : the ﬂagellar promoters did not transcribe through the T-POP insertion elements . 
The inhibition of transcription of the ﬂiAZY operon , which includes the 28 structural gene ( ﬂiA ) , would prevent all class 3 ﬂagellar gene transcription . 
The inhibition of transcription of ﬂiE or the genes downstream of ﬂiG that are needed for the completion of the HBB would result in the accumulation of FlgM in the cell and the inhibition of 28-dependent class 3 ﬂagellar gene transcription . 
The ﬂiG gene containing the T-POP insertion is likely still functional in its role in HBB assembly . 
It is known that the ﬁrst 245 amino acids of FliG are enough to interact with FliM and FliN in order to build the C-ring rotor complex and full-length ﬂagella , but these ﬂagella do not rotate due to a defective interaction with the stator complex ( 53 ) . 
For the ﬂiA , ﬂiE , and ﬂiG mutants , the addition of Tet would induce the transcription of ﬂagellar structural or regulatory genes from the tetA promoter and restore ﬂiC-lac expression . 
The third class of T-POP insertion mutants exhibited a Tet-inducible Lac phenotype . 
The insertions in these mutants potentially inhibited ﬂagellar transcription by inducing the expression of an adjacent gene on the chromosome . 
These TPOP insertions were moved into a wild-type background by P22-mediated transduction and characterized for the effect of Tet on motility . 
The transductants exhibited either a Tet-induced Mot phenotype or a Mot phenotype with or without Tet . 
As conﬁrmed by DNA sequence analysis or linkage tests and complementation analysis , all of the T-POP mutations that produced a Mot phenotype with or without Tet were inserted in the HBB assembly gene ﬂgA . 
While insertions in genes required for HBB assembly normally accumulate high levels of the anti- 28 factor FlgM inside the cell , insertions in ﬂgA have a polar effect on the downstream ﬂgM gene and do not accumulate as much FlgM ( 30 ) . 
The remaining T-POP insertions generating Tet-inducible Mot phenotypes were located in six other regions of the chromosome that are not associated with the ﬂagellar regulon ( Fig. 1 ) . 
The motility of one representative T-POP insertion mutant for each of these six regions is shown in Fig. 2A . 
For three of these regions , T-POP insertions were isolated upstream of the ﬁmZ , rcsB , and ydiV genes ( Fig. 1A , B , and C ) , which have been identiﬁed previously as regu lators of ﬂagellar transcription ( 5 , 7 , 11 , 48 , 57 ) . 
RcsB and FimZ are response regulators with C-terminal DNA-binding domains . 
YdiV shows weak homology to EAL domain proteins , which break down the signaling molecule c-di-GMP ( 20 ) . 
However , YdiV inhibits motility while other EAL domain proteins like YhjH and STM1827 stimulate motility ( 45 -- 48 ) . 
To conﬁrm that FimZ , RcsB , and YdiV were responsible for inhibiting ﬂagellar transcription , each corresponding gene was cloned after the arabinose promoter at the araBAD locus on the chromosome . 
All three constructs inhibited motility when arabinose was added ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Two T-POPs were isolated upstream of the ecnR gene ( Fig. 1D ) . 
While transcription from the tetA promoter of one of the T-POP insertions proceeded away from ecnR into the upstream gene , an insertion in ecnR disrupted the inhibition of motility in the strain . 
Some transcripts originating from the tetR promoter , which initiates transcription in the opposite direction from the tetA promoter , apparently did not terminate before the end of the transposon . 
A Para : : ecnR construct inhibited motility when arabinose was added ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Based on a search using the protein domain database Pfam ( 15 ) , most of EcnR is not homologous to any domains of known function . 
The C terminus of EcnR is homologous to helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domains . 
EcnR is thought to be the regulator of the entericidin genes ecnA and ecnB , which are near ecnR . 
The entericidin genes encode small , amphipathic - helical lipoproteins that act as a toxin-antitoxin system . 
Entericidins may induce apoptosis in stationary-phase E. coli cells ( 3 ) . 
Other T-POP insertions were isolated in front of the pefI and srgD genes on the virulence plasmid of Salmonella ( Fig. 1E ) . 
The pefI and srgD genes are a part of the pef locus , whose genes encode a second set of ﬁmbriae ( the plasmid-encoded fimbriae ) . 
Although the ﬁm locus encodes the major type of ﬁmbriae expressed in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , there are 12 additional ﬁmbrial operons in the genome . 
Some expression of pef ﬁmbriae and other minor ﬁmbriae during growth at low pH or after the infection of intestinal cells can be detected ( 14 , 23 , 39 ) . 
PefI is a DNA-binding protein that affects DNA methylation patterns and inhibits the pefA ﬁmbria promoter . 
PefI is homologous to the E. coli ﬁmbrial regulatory proteins FaeA and PapI ( 39 ) . 
Through a Pfam search ( 15 ) , SrgD appears to be a single-domain protein that contains a helix-turn-helix motif . 
When pefI , srgD , or pefI-srgD was cloned at the ara locus , no signiﬁcant inhibition of motility was observed ( data not shown ) . 
In order to further map the genes responsible , insertions of a large , polar transposon ( MudJ ) were isolated near one of the T-POP insertions . 
A MudJ element inside srgD no longer inhibited motility , and a MudJ element located about 200 bp after srgD continued to inhibit motility ( Fig. 1E ) . 
This genetic analysis suggested that DNA between the T-POP upstream of pefI and the MudJ insertion downstream of srgD was important for the efﬁcient expression of PefI-SrgD or for the inhibition of motility . 
When 250 bp of DNA upstream of pefI was included in the P : : pefI - srgD ara construct , inhibition of motility was observed ( Fig. 2B ) . 
This 250 bp of upstream DNA fused only to srgD was not sufﬁcient to inhibit motility ( data not shown ) . 
This ﬁnding suggests that both pefI and srgD are needed to inhibit motility . 
Adding the 200 bp of DNA downstream of srgD had no effect on inhibition by the ara constructs ( data not shown ) . 
One T-POP insertion was isolated inside the iron transport gene feoB ( Fig. 1F ) . 
MudJ insertions linked to the T-POP were isolated , and DNA sequence analysis revealed that several MudJ insertions were located near feoB and several were inserted in the E. coli F plasmid sequence . 
PCR ampliﬁcation and DNA sequence analysis of this region revealed that a 6-kb section of F plasmid DNA ﬂanked by two T-POPs had transposed into feoB . 
This F plasmid DNA originated from the donor strain and was somehow coinherited along with the T-POP element during transposition . 
The junctions between the T-POP insertions and the F plasmid DNA on the chromosome were identical to the original insertion of the T-POP in the F plasmid in the donor strain . 
It is unclear whether the transfer of F plasmid DNA was a result of a duplication of the T-POP and a chromosomal rearrangement of F plasmid DNA that occurred before transposition or was due to the T-POP uncharacteristically undergoing a replicative transposition event . 
When this F plasmid DNA was recombined out , the T-POP did not signiﬁcantly inhibit motility and only a small , 17 % decrease in class 3 transcription was observed . 
The feoB : : T-POP insertion was not analyzed further . 
Effects on motility of deleting negative regulators . 
Deletions of ecnR , ﬁmZ , pefI-srgD , rcsDBC , and ydiV were examined for their effects on motility and ﬂagellar transcription . 
Deletions of ecnR , rcsDBC , and ydiV signiﬁcantly increased motility and generated a corresponding increase in class 3 transcription ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Increases in motility for rcsB and ydiV mutants have been observed before ( 48 , 57 ) . 
A deletion of pefI-srgD did not signiﬁcantly increase motility or class 3 transcription . 
If pefI-srgD is not highly expressed during growth in LB , this regulator may not have a large effect on motility when deleted . 
In particular , genes in the pef regulon are better expressed in cells grown in acidic media ( 23 , 39 ) . 
When the pefI-srgD deletion strain was inoculated into pH 5.1 motility plates , the deletion strain was not more motile than the wild type ( data not shown ) . 
Therefore , the levels of PefI-SrgD in wild-type cells in motility plates containing a mixture of tryptone , salt , and agar were not enough to inhibit motility . 
Finally , the strain with ﬁmZ deleted showed a small but signiﬁcant decrease in motility , which was an unexpected result for the deletion of a negative regulator of motility . 
If there is coordination among the different ﬁmbrial systems , perhaps a decrease in ﬁmZ levels would upregulate another ﬁmbrial inhibitor of motility like pefI-srgD . 
Epistatic analysis of the negative regulators . 
To determine whether the regulators are in the same or independent pathways for inhibiting motility , a deletion of each regulator was introduced into strains in which one of the ﬁve negative regulators could be induced ( Fig. 4 ) . 
If an overexpressed regulator depends upon a second regulator for inhibition , there should not be any inhibition of motility when that second regulator is deleted . 
The columns in Fig. 4 were arranged in order of increasing motility of the deletion strains , and the rows wer organized in order of increasing ﬂagellar inhibition by each regulator expressed from the arabinose promoter . 
While motility generally increases as one moves up and to the right in Fig. 4 , a number of irregularities in this pattern can be observed . 
First , the deletion of the rcsDBC genes ( Fig. 4 ) or an insertion in rcsB ( data not shown ) completely prevented the inhibition of motility by Para-ecnR . 
This ﬁnding suggests that EcnR acts through RcsB . 
Second , when rcsB was overexpressed in a strain with the rcsDBC genes deleted , a further decrease in motility was seen . 
This effect was more noticeable after a full day 's incubation ( data not shown ) . 
This tighter inhibition has been observed before and is likely a result of RcsC 's no longer being able to remove phosphates to inactivate the response regulator RcsB ( 36 ) . 
Third , the deletion of ydiV relieved the inhibition of motility by all the regulators by more than what would be expected from the 20 % increase in the motility of the ydiV deletion mutant over the wild-type strain . 
This potent effect on motility indicates that YdiV acts by a mechanism that is independent of the mechanism ( s ) of action of the other regulators . 
Overall , with the exception of EcnR , the regulators do not depend upon any of the other four to inhibit motility . 
Effect of regulators on ﬂagellar transcription . 
Transcriptional fusions to the class 1 promoter ( ﬂhC : : MudJ ) , a class 2 promoter ( ﬂiL : : MudJ ) , and a class 3 promoter ( motA : : MudJ ) were utilized to determine which levels of the ﬂagellar transcriptional hierarchy are affected by the negative regulators . 
PefI-SrgD , RcsB , EcnR , and FimZ inhibited all three classes of ﬂagellar promoters ( Fig. 5A ) . 
This result indicates that these four regulators act at the top of the hierarchy at the class 1 promoter . 
In the case of YdiV , only the class 2 and class 3 ﬂagellar promoters were inhibited . 
These data suggest that some step after class 1 transcription is being affected by YdiV . 
Since PefI-SrgD , RcsB , EcnR , and FimZ inhibit class 1 transcription , these regulators may act directly at the class 1 promoter . 
A T-POP insertion located after all known transcription start sites in the class 1 ﬂhDC promoter and upstream of the coding sequence was tested for its ability to bypass the negative regulation ( Fig. 5B ) . 
This T-POP insertion is 163 bp downstream of the ﬁrst transcription start site in the class 1 promoter ( 48 bp upstream of the start codon ) and expresses the ﬂhDC genes from the tetA promoter ( 24 ) . 
As judged by motility and transcriptional fusions to ﬂagellar genes , PefI-SrgD and EcnR were no longer able to inhibit ﬂagellar expression . 
As expected , YdiV still inhibited motility , which is consistent with YdiV 's acting at a step after class 1 transcription . 
RcsB and FimZ , however , retained some capacity for negatively regulating motility . 
This partial inhibition by RcsB and FimZ might be an indirect effect through the upregulation of capsule and ﬁmbrial synthesis . 
More of these extracellular structures may comprise a physical barrier to ﬂagellar assembly . 
Therefore , null mutations of a capsular gene and ﬁmbrial genes were used to test the effect of the absence of these extracellular structures on motility . 
The assembly of ﬁmbriae was disrupted using insertions in the genes for the ﬁlament subunit ( ﬁmA ) , the outer membrane usher ( ﬁmD ) , and the tip adhesin ( ﬁmH ) ( 40 ) . 
For each of the three insertion strains , the loss of ﬁmbriae increased motility in the Para-ﬁmZ T-POP-ﬂhDC background to about 74 % of the wild-type level ( data not shown ) . 
While these insertions did not relieve all of the inhibition , the data indicate that ﬁmbrial structures are themselves inhibitory to motility . 
Capsule production was prevented by using a deletion of the promoter and ﬁrst gene ( wza ) of the capsule synthesis operon . 
This wza deletion did not increase motility ( data not shown ) . 
This result suggests that the capsule itself is not interfering with ﬂagellar synthesis or function and that some other RcsB-regulated gene is responsible . 
In another study , however , this wza deletion did restore full motility in a strain exhibiting high RcsB activity and containing a mutated RcsAB box that prevented RcsB binding ( 57 ) . 
The discrepancy between the ﬁndings of our studies regarding the effect of the wza deletion on motility may result from different approaches for generating increased RcsB activity . 
In the study by Wang et al. ( 57 ) , an igaA mutation was used to induce RcsB activity , whereas we overexpressed RcsB directly from the arabinose promoter . 
Our different approaches may have induced different gene sets and inhibited motility through different mechanisms . 
Spontaneous mutations that disrupt inhibition by EcnR and PefI-SrgD . 
To further map the pathways by which the novel regulators ( EcnR and PefI-SrgD ) inhibit motility , spontaneous Mot mutants were isolated and characterized . 
Colonies of the T-POP-pefI-srgD strain ( TH8774 ) or the Para-ecnR strain ( TH9386 ) were poked into motility plates containing tetracy cline or arabinose , respectively , to inhibit motility , and the plates were incubated overnight at 30 °C . 
Mot mutants were then picked . 
Only one motile ﬂare from each inoculated colony was chosen to ensure that each mutation originated independently . 
Of 46 spontaneous Mot mutations isolated in the T-POP-pefI-srgD strain , 36 were linked to the T-POP and 10 were linked to ﬂhDC . 
Of 45 spontaneous Mot mutations isolated in the Para-ecnR strain , 13 were linked to the ara locus , 6 were linked to rcsB , and 26 were linked to ﬂhDC . 
This spontaneous-mutation analysis suggests that no other nones-sential genes are involved in these pathways . 
The ﬂhDC promoter was sequenced for mutations linked to ﬂhDC ( Fig. 6 ) . 
Similar ﬂhDC promoter mutations were observed for EcnR and PefI-SrgD : mutations in the ﬁrst 15 bp of the untranslated region for the P1 transcript and mutations that increased the match to the consensus sequence in the 10 hexamers for 70 . 
Since EcnR and PefI-SrgD probably do not inhibit the ﬂhDC promoter in the same way , these mutations are likely to be suppressors that generally increase ﬂhDC transcription . 
It may be that single mutations do not disrupt EcnR and PefI-SrgD binding sites enough to restore motility . 
Effect of ﬂagellar synthesis on the transcription of negative regulators . 
While we have demonstrated that these ﬁve regulators inhibit ﬂagellar transcription , these regulators are part of a regulatory network and might themselves be affected by ﬂagellar proteins . 
To test this , lac fusions to ecnR , ydiV , ﬁmH , rcsB , and srgD were isolated or constructed . 
The T-POP insertion in front of the class 1 ﬂhDC promoter was moved into the resulting lac fusion strains . 
By inducing ﬂagellar transcription using the T-POP , we could determine the effect of ﬂagellar gene expression on the transcription of each of these regulatory genes ( Fig. 7 ) . 
The ecnR gene was turned off in the absence of ﬂagellar gene expression and turned on following ﬂhDC induction . 
This feedback on ecnR transcription probably moderates the level of expression of both ecnR and the ﬂagellar genes . 
A computational search for FlhD4C2 or 28 binding sites revealed a weak match to the FlhD4C2 consensus sequence 80 bp upstream of the ecnR start codon . 
Transcription of the ydiV gene , on the other hand , increased in the absence of ﬂagellar gene expression . 
Since EAL domain proteins like YdiV are involved in the switch between swimming and sticking to surfaces , this competition between ydiV and ﬂagellar genes for transcription may contribute to tighter regulation . 
The lac fusions to ﬁmH , rcsB , and srgD were not affected by the induction of the ﬂagellar regulon .

DISCUSSION
A screen for transposon insertions that inducibly affected ﬂagellar transcription enabled us to identify two new regulators ( EcnR and PefI-SrgD ) in addition to three known regulators ( FimZ , RcsB , and YdiV ) of ﬂagellar synthesis . 
Other T-POP insertions upstream of ﬂagellar genes were isolated . 
Deletions and lac fusions were used to separate the regulators into pathways and map interactions . 
Even though all ﬁve regulators inhibited ﬂagellar transcription , these regulatory proteins exhibited little cross talk ( Fig. 8 ) . 
Only EcnR was dependent upon another regulator ( RcsB ) for the inhibition of motility . 
These proteins provide further evidence that other regulatory systems act independently and in parallel to control the ﬂagellar regulon . 
Four of the negative regulators that were analyzed in this study may contribute to a regulatory network for external structures . 
RcsB is an activator of capsule synthesis , FimZ upregulates type 1 ﬁmbriae , PefI controls the synthesis of virulence plasmid-encoded ﬁmbriae , and YdiV has weak homology to EAL domain proteins which are known to decrease c-di-GMP levels , enhance swimming , and decrease cell adhesion to surfaces . 
Since RcsB , FimZ , and PefI-SrgD are associated with speciﬁc structures involved in sticking to surfaces , it makes sense that these regulators would inhibit ﬂagellar transcription . 
As a c-di-GMP-related protein , YdiV may coordinate the sticking and swimming strategies more generally . 
YdiV 's role in shutting off ﬂagellar expression may be more important during the infection of host cells , since YdiV has been implicated previously in the level of macrophage killing during pathogenesis ( 20 ) . 
The function of EcnR is less clear . 
Because the ecnR gene is located next to the entericidin genes , EcnR may be involved in their regulation . 
It has been proposed previously that the entericidins in E. coli are produced in stationary phase to kill some cells in order to feed the rest of the population ( 3 ) . 
If this hypothesis is correct , entericidins and ﬂagella would represent two different strategies for survival . 
Flagella are used to ﬁnd more nutrients , and entericidins would enable survival without nutrients . 
EcnR may help coordinate these two strategies . 
Moreover , the activation of ecnR transcription by ﬂagellar genes may provide the entericidin system with a readout on the metabolic state of the cell . 
Part of the ﬂagellar inhibition by FimZ was determined to occur at a step after class 1 transcription . 
Mutations in the structural genes for ﬁmbriae removed some of this secondary inhibition of motility by FimZ . 
These data suggest that the ﬁmbrial structure can be inhibitory to ﬂagellar synthesis or function , as has been observed before in E. coli ( 19 , 31 , 48 ) . 
The inhibition of ﬂagellar synthesis may occur through ﬁmbrial proteins acting as a physical barrier to the assembly of the ﬂagellum past the outer membrane . 
An example of this sort of inhibition may exist in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi , in which the Vi capsular antigen is able to inhibit ﬂagellar secretion ( 1 ) . 
Alternatively , inhibition may occur through the proton motive force ( PMF ) . 
If excess ﬁmbrial production depletes the PMF , the result will be the inhibition of ﬂagellar assembly since ﬂagellar secretion utilizes the PMF ( 41 ) . 
Finally , the inhibition may occur through competition for secretion systems or other resources to build the extracellular structures . 
The presence of fewer functional ﬂagella may provide feedback to reduce ﬂagellar transcription through ﬂagellar regulatory proteins like FlgM and FliT . 
While two new regulators of ﬂagellar transcription were identiﬁed in this study , our screen probably did not saturate the genome . 
Insertions in front of the genes for known regulators like AdrA , CAP , ClpXP , CsrA , Fur , H-NS , and RtsB were not isolated . 
Regulators that have a more subtle effect on ﬂagellar transcription might not have been detected on the Mac-Lac indicator medium for the ﬂiC-lac reporter fusion that was used . 
Since we did not saturate our screen for low-level effects , there are likely to be other parts of the ﬂagellar regulatory network that have not been identiﬁed . 
Further characterization of these pathways should improve our understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms involved in adapting to different environments . 
FIG. 7 . 
Effect of the ﬂagellar system on the transcription of the negative regulator genes . 
The fusion of lac to each negative regulator gene was used to quantify changes in transcription . 
The ﬂhDC operon was expressed from its wild-type promoter or from the tetA promoter in the T-POP . 
When under the control of the T-POP , the ﬂhDC operon is not expressed without the inducer chlortetracycline ( chlortet . ) 
FIG. 8 . 
Diagram of interactions for the ﬁve negative regulators identiﬁed in this study . 
While arrows show interactions between the regulators and the ﬂagellar system , it is not known whether the majority of the interactions are direct or are mediated by regulators other than the ﬁve that were studied . 
A binding site in the class 1 promoter has been identiﬁed only for RcsB ( 57 ) . 
It is also not clear how RcsB helps EcnR to inhibit class 1 transcription , and this interaction is labeled with a question mark . 
Since part of RcsB 's inhibition of mo-tility occurs after class 1 transcription , EcnR may not inhibit ﬂagellar transcription by directly activating RcsB .
