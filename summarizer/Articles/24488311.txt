Infection of intestinal epithelial cells is dependent on the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium pathogenicity island 1 ( Spi1 ) - encoded type III injectisome system and ﬂagellar motility . 
Thus , the expression of virulence and ﬂagellar genes is subject to tight regulatory control mechanisms in order to ensure the correct spatiotemporal production of the respective gene products . 
In this work , we reveal a new level of cross-regulation between the Spi1 and ﬂagellar regulatory systems . 
Transposon mutagenesis identiﬁed a class of mutants that prevented ﬂhDC autorepression by overexpressing HilD . 
HilD , HilC , RtsA , and HilA comprise a positive regulatory circuit for the expression of the Spi1 genes . 
Here , we report a novel transcriptional cross talk between the Spi1 and ﬂagellar regulons where HilD transcriptionally activates ﬂhDC gene expression by binding to nucleotides 68 to 24 upstream from the P5 transcriptional start site . 
We additionally show that , in contrast to the results of a previous report , HilA does not affect ﬂagellar gene expression . 
Finally , we discuss a model of the cross-regulation network between Spi1 and the ﬂagellar system and propose a regulatory mechanism via the Spi1 master regulator HilD that would prime ﬂagellar genes for rapid reactivation during host infection . 
The enteropathogenic Gram-negative bacteria of the genus Sal-monella are responsible for the food-borne illness gastroenteritis , localized infection of the small intestine , and systemic enteric ( typhoid ) fevers . 
Symptoms of Salmonella infection include diarrhea , abdominal cramps , and fever ( 1 ) . 
The effector-driven manipulations of the vertebrate host cells are dependent on two virulence-associated type III secretion systems ( vT3SS ; injectisome ) ( 2 -- 4 ) encoded in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimu-rium pathogenicity island 1 ( Spi1 ) ( 5 ) and Spi2 ( 6 ) . 
The Spi1 and Spi2 virulence systems are responsible for different processes related to Salmonella pathogenesis that occur at different time points during infection . 
Spi1 is needed for the invasion of the intestinal epithelium leading to gastroenteritis ( 7 , 8 ) , while Spi2 plays a role during trafﬁcking to the basolateral side of epi-thelial cells ( 9 ) and during later Salmonella replication and survival within macrophages ( 10 , 11 ) . 
Both systems are regulated in a spatial and temporal manner to ensure the production of gene products at the correct points during infection . 
The Spi1 genes are highly regulated by a set of DNA-binding proteins , including the AraC-like regulators HilD , HilC , and RtsA . 
In a feed-forward loop , each of those regulators can activate the hilD , hilC , and rtsA genes , as well as the gene encoding the transcriptional Spi1 activator HilA ( 12 ) . 
HilD is a dominant regulator of hilA transcription , while HilC and RtsA amplify hilA gene expression ( 12 , 13 ) . 
The needle-like injectisome system is evolutionarily related to the bacterial ﬂagellum ( 14 ) . 
Bioinformatic and structural analysis demonstrated that the two share many similar features ( 15 ) ; however , differences exist regarding the purpose of protein secretion in the two systems . 
In case of the ﬂagellum , secreted substrate proteins are mainly needed for ﬂagellum assembly . 
The ﬂagellar type III secretion system ( fT3SS ) exports substrate subunits that assemble into a functional ﬂagellum and regulatory factors that control the assembly process . 
Completed ﬂagella are used by the bacterium to move in liquid environments and across hydrated surfaces by rotation of the rigid , helical ﬂagellar ﬁlaments . 
The virulence-associated vT3SS of Spi1 is essential for both the assembly of the injectisome needle-like structure ( 16 , 17 ) and the secretion of effector proteins into host cells , where they can alter cellular processes to facilitate the infection process as described above . 
Flagellar gene expression is under spatiotemporal control by a transcriptional hierarchy of three promoter classes . 
On top of the cascade is the ﬂagellar master operon , ﬂhDC , which is under the control of a 70-dependent ﬂagellar class 1 promoter . 
A functional FlhD4C2 complex is required for subsequent ﬂagellar class 2 promoter transcription . 
Flagellar class 2 gene products are required for the structure and assembly of a ﬂagellar hook-basal body ( HBB ) . 
One class 2 gene product , 28 ( encoded by the ﬂiA gene ) , is a sigma transcription factor that directs RNA polymerase to transcribe the ﬂagellar class 3 promoters . 
The products of ﬂagellar class 3 transcription are needed after HBB completion ( 18 -- 20 ) to form the ﬁlament , motor force generators , and chemosensory components . 
The ﬂagellar master operon is under the control of a variety of different factors that either positively or negatively inﬂuence ﬂhDC expression . 
Both global positive regulators , such as the nucleoid proteins Fis and H-NS or the cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) - catabo-lite activator protein ( CAP ) complex ( 21 -- 23 ) , and negative regulators , such as RﬂM , the Spi1 regulator RtsB , or SlyA , bind within and act upon the ﬂhDC promoter ( 24 , 25 ) . 
The regulator RtsB is encoded in an operon with rtsA and functions as a repressor of ﬂagellar class 1 gene expression . 
The rtsAB operon is transcriptionally activated by HilD , HilC , and RtsA . 
In addition , a regulatory feedback loop acting on ﬂhDC transcription via RﬂM has been reported ( 26 , 27 ) . 
The inhibitory effect of RﬂM on ﬂhDC expression has been shown to be dependent on the RcsCDB system ( 28 ) , a positive regulator of Spi2 and other genes associated with bacterial cell growth in macrophages ( 29 ) . 
Signiﬁcant amounts of biosynthetic resources and energy are required in order to synthesize , assemble , and rotate a functional ﬂagellum ( 30 , 31 ) . 
For that reason , the expression of the ﬂagellar regulon is controlled in response to various factors and according to the bacterium 's motility needs . 
Under low-nutrient conditions , ﬂagellar gene expression is either induced ( Escherichia coli ) or repressed ( Salmonella ) ( 32 -- 34 ) . 
Importantly , ﬂagellar gene expression and assembly are repressed during early bioﬁlm formation , during survival inside macrophages , during early infection ( 2 h postinfection [ p.i. ] ) of epithelial cells , and within the mesenteric lymph nodes and the spleen ( 34 -- 39 ) . 
However , the expression of ﬂagellar biosynthesis genes was upregulated during late infection of epithelial cells ( 4 h and 6 h p.i. ) and ﬂiC : : gfp transcription was reported in the Peyer 's patches ( 7 days p.i. ) , providing evidence for de novo synthesis of ﬂagellin during the infection process ( 38 , 39 ) . 
Regarding survival within host cells , undermining the host cell 's defense system and preventing the immune system from recognizing the surface-exposed ﬁlament appears to be associated with pathogenesis ( 40 ) . 
Salmonella bacteria can grow and survive in multiple different niches , and this requires a precise coordination of gene expression with environmental sensing . 
Therefore , Spi1 , Spi2 , and the ﬂagellar regulon share common regulatory components that coregulate the many genes of each system . 
Cross talk between the ﬂagellar and Spi1 regulon exists through FlhDC-dependent ﬂiZ gene transcription . 
FliZ is expressed from ﬂagellar class 2 and 3 promoters and functions as a regulator of HilD protein activity . 
Elevated levels of HilD protein activate hilA gene expression ( 41 -- 44 ) . 
In addition , FliZ positively regulates ﬂagellar class 2 gene transcription via the repression of YdiV , an antiFlhD4C2 factor ( 34 , 45 -- 47 ) . 
YdiV binds to FlhD and prevents the FlhD4C2 complex from binding to ﬂagellar class 2 promoters and targets FlhDC for ClpXP-dependent proteolytic degradation ( 34 , 48 ) . 
Stewart et al. reported that ydiV mutant strains were unable to fully repress ﬂagellin production and thus caused increased caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis as a defense mechanism of Salmonella-infected macrophages ( 49 ) . 
At the same time , an increased rate of macrophage killing was reported for ydiV-deﬁcient Salmonella ( 50 ) . 
Controversial results have been reported regarding the regulation of the ﬂagellar system via the Spi1 master regulator HilA . 
Thijs et al. showed direct binding of HilA to the ﬂhDC promoter region and downregulation of ﬂhDC expression under invasive conditions ( 51 ) . 
However , earlier studies showed that HilA did not affect ﬂhD-lux transcriptional fusions when bacteria were grown in motility agar ( 52 ) . 
An interconnecting cross talk can also be found between the Spi1 and Spi2 regulons at the level of HilD ( 53 ) . 
During stationary growth in lysogeny broth ( LB ) in vitro , the onset of HilD-dependent Spi2 gene activation occured at a later time point than the HilD-dependent activation of the Spi1 system . 
In experiments under conditions resembling the intracellular environment , HilD was not required for activation of the Spi2 regulon . 
These data of Bustamante et al. ( 53 ) suggest that the activation of the Spi2 system is purposely regulated via two distinct pathways , which come into play depending on the environmental factors within a given niche . 
Cross talk between the Spi1 , Spi2 , and ﬂagellar regulatory systems is therefore likely of great importance to Salmonella for spatiotemporal coordination of motility and virulence .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains , plasmids , and media . 
Detailed information about bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study is listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material . 
Salmonella Typhimurium strain LT2 or ATCC 14028 was cultured in lysogeny broth ( LB ) ( 54 ) that was supple-1 1 mented with kanamycin ( 50 g ml ) , tetracycline ( Tc ; 15 g ml ) , or 1 anhydrotetracycline ( 1 g ml ) if needed . 
Gene expression from the arabinose promoter was induced by the addition of 0.2 % L-arabinose . 
The Salmonella Typhimurium generalized transducing phage P22 HT105/1 int-201 was used in all crosses ( 55 ) . 
Cultures of the virulent Salmonella Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028 were grown under Spi1-inducing conditions ( high osmolarity and low oxygen ) as described previously ( 26 ) . 
Isolation of random T-POP insertions . 
Transposon T-POP insertions in strain TH15941 [ araBAD1007 : : ﬂhD C ﬂhC5213 : : MudJ ﬂiA5886 ( R91C L207P ) ( changes of R to C at position 91 and L to P at position 207 are encoded by ﬂiA5886 ) ] were isolated as described previously ( 26 ) . 
Brieﬂy , TH15941 expresses the ﬂhD C operon from the chromosomal araBAD promoter ( ParaBAD ) and carries a chromosomal ﬂhC-lac transcriptional reporter fusion ( ﬂhC5213 : : MudJ ) , as well as a ﬂiA null allele that is defective in DNA binding ( 56 ) . 
TH15941 becomes Lac deﬁcient in the presence of arabinose ( Ara Lac ) due to induction of ﬂhD C transcription from ParaBAD and autorepression of ﬂhC-lac reporter transcription by FlhD4C2 . 
T-POP insertions were introduced into TH15941 carrying plasmid pNK2881 , and approximately 30,000 random T-POP insertions were screened for the loss of FlhD4C2-mediated repression of ﬂhDC in the presence of tetracycline . 
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR . 
RNA isolation was performed for three independent biological replicates using the RNeasy minikit ( Qiagen ) . 
For removal of genomic DNA , RNA was treated with DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C using the DNA-Free RNA Kit ( Zymo Research ) . 
Subsequently , RNA samples were reverse transcribed according to the RevertAid ﬁrst strand cDNA synthesis kit ( Fermentas ) . 
Quantitative real-time PCRs were performed using the EvaGreen quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) master mix ( Bio-Rad ) on a CFX96 real-time PCR instrument ( Bio-Rad ) . 
Relative changes in mRNA levels were analyzed according to the method of Pfafﬂ ( 57 ) and normalized against the transcription levels of reference genes rpoB , rpoD , gyrB , and gmk . 
- Galactosidase assays . 
- Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously using at least three independent biological replicates ( 26 ) . 
Cultures were supplemented with 0.2 % L-arabinose and 1 1 g ml anhydrotetracycline if needed . 
ST14028 experiments were performed under Spi1-inducing ( high-salt and low-oxygen ) and regular LB conditions . 
Luminescence assay . 
Luminescence measurements were made using a PerkinElmer 2030 microplate reader . 
Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in LB supplemented with 0.2 % arabinose and grown in a microtiter plate for 3 h at 37 °C . 
An amount of 25 g ml 1 kanamycin was added to all cultures in order to retain the ﬂhDC promoter duplication . 
Luminescence was measured for 3 s , and absorbance at 595 nm was measured before and after the luminescence readout for 0.1 s each time . 
The luminescence was normalized to the average optical density . 
Within one experiment , all samples were grown on the same plate . 
For each strain , at least four biological replicates were measured per plate . 
All samples were normalized against the wild-type control . 
Puriﬁcation of HilD protein . 
For HilD protein puriﬁcation , HilD was fused to an Ulp1-cleavable His6-SUMO tag ( 58 ) . 
Protein expression was induced for 6 h by the addition of 0.2 mM isopropyl - - D-thiogalactopy-ranoside ( IPTG ) during growth at 18 °C with shaking at 120 rpm . 
Soluble protein was puriﬁed using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid ( NTA ) agarose ( Pro-tino ; Macherey-Nagel ) under native conditions . 
Puriﬁed His6-SUMO-HilD protein was dialyzed overnight and afterwards incubated with recombinantly produced His6-Ulp1 protease overnight at 4 °C . 
His6-Ulp1 protease , cleaved His6-SUMO , and uncut His6-SUMO-HilD were removed by binding to Ni-NTA agarose . 
EMSA . 
DNA fragments were ampliﬁed from Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 genomic DNA by PCR using a 20-bp overhang in the 5 = region that allowed 5 = biotinylation in a subsequent PCR using a biotinylated primer ( 5 = - biotin-GATCATGCTGACACGTACGG-3 =) . 
The ampliﬁed PCR products were designated fragment 1 ( 5 = - GATCATGCTGACACGTACG GTCACATATTTTCTAAAATCGCC-3 = and 5 = - GAAGCAAAAAGGTCA AATGC-3 =) , fragment 2 ( 5 = - GATCATGCTGACACGTACGGCGTTATT TTAACAGAGAGAAAC-3 = and 5 = - CATACAACGGAGCGGGAC-3 =) , fragment 3 ( 5 = - GATCATGCTGACACGTACGGGCTAAAAGTTAAATC AAATGAGC-3 = and 5 = - GTCAACACCAAATTCTTTTTTG-3 =) , fragment 3 = ( 5 = - GATCATGCTGACACGTACGGATTCTTATGTAAAGAAT CGTGGC-3 = and 5 = - ATTTTAGAAACGCTTTTATTTTACC-3 =) , ﬂhDC coding ( 5 = - GATCATGCTGACACGTACGGGGAGTTGATTAATCTTG GCG-3 = and 5 = - GACACTGCTCAAGATAAAGC-3 =) , and gyrA ( 5 = - GAT CATGCTGACACGTACGGATGAGCGACCTTGCGAGAG-3 = and 5 = - G CGCACGGCCAACAATGACC-3 =) . 
Gel shift assays were carried out using the LightShift chemiluminescent electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) kit ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol . 
Increasing amounts of puriﬁed HilD were incubated with 0.01 pmol of each of the biotinylated DNA fragments and 50 ng l 1 unspeciﬁc competitor DNA [ poly ( dI-dC ) ] ( Sigma ) for 20 min at room temperature ( RT ) . 
A 250-fold molar excess of the unlabeled DNA fragment was added to the highest protein concentration to demonstrate speciﬁc binding . 
Biotin-labeled DNA was detected after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transfer to a nylon membrane , and UV cross-linking using chemiluminescence detection . 
DNase I footprint . 
The ﬂhDC DNA fragment comprising the putative HilD binding site was PCR ampliﬁed from Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 genomic DNA using 5 = digoxigenin ( DIG ) - labeled primers ( 5 = - GATCAT GCTGACACGTACGGATTCTTATGTAAAGAATCGTGGC-3 = and 5 = - DIG-GTCAACACCAAATTCTTTTTTG-3 =) . 
DNase I ( AppliChem ) was added to the binding reaction mixtures containing 100 ng DIG-labeled DNA fragments and increasing amounts of HilD after 20 min at RT. . 
The reaction was stopped by adding stop solution ( 10 mM EDTA , 10 g ml 1 yeast tRNA ) , and DNA was recovered using phenol-chloroform extraction . 
Sequencing reactions were carried out using the USB Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing kit ( Afﬁmetrix ) . 
Samples were separated on 6 % Tris-borate-EDTA ( TBE ) -- 7 M urea polyacrylamide gels . 
DNA was transferred to a Nytran nylon membrane ( GE Healthcare ) and , after UV cross-linking , was detected using CDP-Star ( Roche ) and the anti-digoxige-nin-AP ( alkaline phosphatase ) antibody ( Fab fragments ; Roche ) . 
RESULTS
HilD links Spi1 and ﬂagellar gene regulation . 
We have recently identiﬁed RﬂM ( formerly EcnR ) as a negative regulator of ﬂhDC transcription that is activated by FlhDC in an FlhDC-RﬂM feedback loop . 
Transposon T-POP insertions in the rﬂM gene resulted in loss of FlhDC autorepression ( 26 ) . 
In this screen , a class of T-POP insertions were also isolated that lost FlhDC autorepression but only in the presence of tetracycline ( Tc ) . 
The T-POP transposon will transcribe genes adjacent to the site of insertion by induction of a Tc-inducible promoter , PtetA , within the T-POP element . 
We hypothesized that transcription from the T-POP-encoded PtetA into genes adjacent to the site of T-POP insertion resulted in Tc-dependent expression of an ﬂhDC activator . 
DNA sequence analysis revealed that this class of transposons had inserted upstream from the hilD coding region . 
The hilD-linked insertions required induction of PtetA within the T-POP element for loss of FlhDC autorepression . 
We envisioned at least two mechanisms by which activation of HilD could bypass the auto-regulatory effect of FlhDC overexpression . 
HilD could act to either repress rﬂM , the inhibitor of ﬂhDC transcription , or activate ﬂhDC expression and overcome the inhibition of ﬂhDC via RﬂM . 
HilD is a known activator of hilA transcription ; HilA then activates the transcription of genes encoding the Spi1 type III secretion apparatus and Spi1 effector proteins through InvF ( 24 , 59 , 60 ) . 
HilD could also act directly on the rﬂM promoter region to repress rﬂM transcription or activate transcription of another protein that represses rﬂM . 
We ﬁrst analyzed the potential inhibition of rﬂM gene transcription by HilD using quantitative real-time PCR . 
As shown in Fig . 
S1A in the supplemental material , HilD induction , surprisingly , resulted in about a 50 % increase in rﬂM transcript levels . 
This suggested a direct activation of the rﬂM activator FlhDC by HilD . 
This was conﬁrmed by analyzing the - galactosidase activity of transcriptional rﬂM fusions , which showed an increase in rﬂM-lac transcription upon HilD overexpression ( see Fig . 
S1B , lanes 2 and 3 ) . 
Upon deletion of ﬂhDC , the activating effect of HilD was neutralized and rﬂM transcription was abolished ( see Fig . 
S1B , lane 4 ) . 
We next tested the possibility that HilD might act directly on ﬂhDC transcription . 
As shown by the results in Fig. 1A , HilD overexpression had a strong positive effect on ﬂhDC mRNA levels as analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR . 
This activation of ﬂhDC expression was conﬁrmed using an ﬂhC-lac reporter fusion . 
As shown by the results in Fig. 1B , ﬂhC-lac expression increased approximately 3-fold upon HilD overexpression in an attenuated Salmonella LT2 background under normal LB growth conditions ( Fig. 1B , bar 2 ) . 
In results comparable to those for the LT2 strain , ﬂhC transcription upon HilD overexpression also increased in the virulent Salmonella background ST14028s grown under Spi1-in-ducing conditions ( Fig. 1B , bars 5 and 6 ) . 
The induction of Spi1 gene transcription by HilD additionally resulted in a growth defect , as described previously ( 61 ) . 
However , deletion of the Spi1 region of the chromosome [ ( invH-sprB ) ] ( Fig. 1B , Spi1 ) relieved the growth-inhibitory effect of HilD overproduction ( not shown ) . 
The retarded growth under HilD-overproducing conditions had an effect on our growth-based - galactosidase assays ( Fig. 1B , compare bar 5 , Spi1 , to bar 6 , Spi1 ) , and the HilD-activating effect on ﬂhDC operon transcription was therefore more pronounced in strains harboring the invH-sprB deletion ( Spi1 ) . 
In order to further characterize the effect of HilD on ﬂagellar gene expression , we analyzed transcriptional lac fusions to individual ﬂagellar class 1 , class 2 , and class 3 promoters . 
Upon overexpression of HilD from the arabinose promoter ( Fig. 1C , HilD1 ) , we observed a 2-fold increase in ﬂhC-lac ( class 1 ) transcription and a 3-fold increase in both ﬂiL-lac ( class 2 ) and ﬂjB-lac ( class 3 ) expression ( Fig. 1C ) . 
Mutant strains overexpressing a DNA-binding-deﬁcient variant of HilD missing its helix-turn-helix binding motif ( Fig. 1C , HilD HTH1 ) were lacking the HilD effect and showed ﬂagellar gene expression levels comparable to those of the wild-type control . 
We next uncoupled the expression of the ﬂagellar master regulator ﬂhDC from any transcriptional regulation using a tetracy-cline-inducible ﬂhDC promoter ( 62 ) . 
Under PtetA-ﬂhD C conditions , neither HilD nor HilD HTH overexpression showed any effect on ﬂagellar gene expression ( Fig. 1D ) . 
These results suggested that HilD acted by transcriptional activation of the class 1 ﬂhDC promoter . 
In a complementary experiment , we analyzed ﬂagellar gene expression levels in a background overexpressing the Spi1 master regulator HilA . 
HilA was suggested to be a regulator of ﬂhDC transcription ( 51 ) . 
As shown in Fig . 
S2 in the supplemental material , we could rule out an effect of HilA on ﬂagellar gene transcription and thereby conﬁrmed that the observed 
FIG 1 HilD activates ﬂhDC transcription via P5 of ﬂhDC . 
( A ) Relative ﬂhDC expression ( log2 ) compared to wild-type mRNA levels of strain TH6701 ( Para : : tetRA ) . 
Transcript levels were compared by quantitative real-time PCR . 
The effect of arabinose-induced overexpression of HilD ( TH16339 ) on ﬂhDC expression was monitored using total mRNA of three independent biological samples grown in arabinose-containing medium . 
( B ) The level of transcription of an ﬂhC-lac fusion was quantiﬁed under HilD-overproducing conditions . 
The activity from the lac reporter was measured at mid-log phase . 
For Salmonella LT2 , transcription levels of EM4 ( Para : : hilD ﬂhC : : MudJ invH-sprB : : FCF [ FLP recombination target { FRT } - chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-FRT ] ) were compared to those of the control strain EM97 ( Para : : tetRA ﬂhC : : MudJ invH-sprB : : FCF ) . 
Both strains had Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( Spi1 ) deleted to ensure comparable growth of the cultures , as described in the text . 
The pathogenic strain ATCC 14028s was grown under Spi1-inducing conditions as further described in Materials and Methods . 
The ATCC 14028s mutants analyzed were EM665 ( Para : : FRT ﬂhC : : MudJ ) , EM674 ( Para : : FRT invH-sprB : : FCF ﬂhC : : MudJ ) , EM640 ( Para : : hilD ﬂhC : : MudJ ) , and EM667 ( Para : : hilD invH-sprB : : FCF ﬂhC : : MudJ ) . 
( C ) Effects of overproduced HilD and of HilD with its DNA-binding domain deleted ( hilD HTH ) on ﬂagellar genes expressed from class 1 ( ﬂhC-lac ) , class 2 ( ﬂiL-lac ) , and class 3 ( ﬂjB-lac ) promoters . 
Strains TH13751 ( Para : : FCF ﬂhC : : MudJ ) , TH13752 ( Para : : FCF ﬂiL : : MudJ ) , TH14571 ( Para : : FCF ﬂjB : : MudJ ) , TH16386 ( Para : : hilD ﬂhC : : MudJ ) , TH16385 ( Para : : hilD ﬂiL : : MudJ ) , TH16423 ( Para : : hilD ﬂjB : : MudJ ) , EM886 ( Para : : hilD HTH ﬂhC : : MudJ ) , EM887 ( Para : : hilD HTH ﬂiL : : MudJ ) , and EM885 ( Para : : hilD HTH ﬂjB : : MudJ ) were analyzed by - galacto-sidase assay . 
( D ) Effect of overproduced HilD on ﬂagellar gene expression under artiﬁcially induced ﬂhDC expression conditions . 
The strains analyzed were TH13659 ( Para : : FCF PtetA : : ﬂhD C ﬂhC : : MudJ ) , TH13919 ( Para : : FCF PtetA : : ﬂhD C ﬂiL : : MudJ ) , TH14845 ( Para : : FCF PtetA : : ﬂhD C ﬂjB : : MudJ ) , EM804 ( P : : hilD ara PtetA : : ﬂhD C ﬂhC : : MudJ ) , EM802 ( Para : : hilD PtetA : : ﬂhD C ﬂiL : : MudJ ) , EM801 ( Para : : hilD PtetA : : ﬂhD C ﬂjB : : MudJ ) , EM858 ( Para : : hilD HTH PtetA : : ﬂhD C ﬂhC : : MudJ ) , EM868 ( P : : hilD P ara HTH tetA : : ﬂhD C ﬂiL : : MudJ ) , and EM869 ( Para : : hilD HTH PtetA : : ﬂhD C ﬂjB : : MudJ ) . 
( E ) ﬂhDC operon transcription from individual ﬂhDC promoters was analyzed by introducing a ( luxDCABE-Km ) - ﬂhDC promoter fusion . 
In these constructs , the entire ﬂhDC promoter region was fused to a luxCDBAE-kanamycin cassette . 
We generated six individual strains in which the 10 boxes of ﬁve of the six known transcriptional ﬂhDC start sites ( 63 ) were mutated with GTTGGT ( 72 ) . 
The individual strains , retaining only one functional , wild-type 10 box , were labeled P1 , P2 , P3 , P4 , P5 , and P6 , respectively . 
In order to retain a functional ﬂhDC operon , a duplication of P - ﬂhD C ﬂhDC follows the PﬂhDC-luxCDBAE cassette . 
To hold the duplication , 25 g/ml kanamycin was added to the LB growth medium . 
For all strains , a invH-sprB ( Spi1 ) background was used . 
Luminescence is shown relative to that of the strain with genotype Para : : FRT PﬂhDC ( P1-6 ) - luxCDBAE-Km-PﬂhD C . 
Two independent runs with six replicates each were combined . 
( A to E ) Error bars represent the standard errors of the means , and asterisks indicate the gene expression levels that differed signiﬁcantly ( * , P 0.05 , or *** , P 0.001 ) . 
Data were analyzed by the Student t test . 
Biological replicates are shown as individual data points ( diamonds ) , and the relevant genotypes are indicated as follows : , a chromosomal wild-type copy of the gene is present ; 1 , the gene is chromosomally overexpressed from an arabinose-inducible promoter ; , the respective gene was deleted from the strain . 
HilD effect on ﬂhDC transcription was not an indirect effect via HilA . 
The ﬂhDC promoter region was reported to consist of six transcriptional start sites upstream from the ﬂhD gene and annotated P1 through P6 ( 63 ) . 
To determine which ﬂhDC transcriptional start site was activated by HilD , we subsequently measured HilDmediated expression of lux fusions to individual ﬂhDC promoters . 
Upon induction of HilD , ﬂhDC expression was detected for the construct with P1 through P6 , as well as for the P5 promoter fusion ( Fig. 1E ) . 
We therefore concluded that HilD acts solely on the P5 promoter to activate ﬂhDC transcription . 
Many regulatory proteins that act on ﬂhDC transcription bind to a region close to the P1 promoter , like RcsB ( 5 to 19 nucle-otides from the P1 transcription start site ) or RtsB ( 4 to 106 nucleotides from the P1 transcription start site ) ( 24 , 29 ) . 
We tested possible dominant effects of simultaneous overproduction of both HilD ( acting as activator of P5 transcription ) and RtsB ( acting as repressor of P1 transcription ) on ﬂhDC operon transcription . 
As shown by the results in Fig . 
S3A in the supplemental material , RtsB overproduction decreased ﬂhD-lac levels , whereas HilD had an activating effect . 
We did not observe a change in ﬂhD-lac expression compared to that in the wild type when we overproduced both RtsB and HilD concurrently . 
This suggested that the repressor RtsB and the activator HilD acted simultaneously on different promoters of ﬂhDC . 
We further explored this possibility by analyzing the expression of lux fusions to individual ﬂhDC promoters under conditions where either HilD or RtsB was overexpressed ( see Fig . 
S3B ) . 
As demonstrated by the results described above , the expression of HilD activated ﬂhDC expression from the P5 promoter , whereas the expression of RtsB had no effect on ﬂhDC transcription from the P5 promoter . 
In contrast , RtsB overexpression showed a signiﬁcant repression of ﬂhDC expression from the P1 promoter , demonstrating that RtsB and HilD can act independently as repressors and activators of different ﬂhDC promoters . 
To further test the idea that HilD directly activates ﬂhDC by binding to the ﬂhDC promoter region , we performed electropho-retic mobility shift assays using puriﬁed HilD protein and various promoter fragments of ﬂhDC . 
DNA fragments comprising the P1 promoter ( fragment 1 ; nucleotides 271 to 71 upstream from the ﬂhD coding region ) , the P2 , P3 , P4 , and P6 promoters ( fragment 2 ; nucleotides 431 to 231 upstream from the ﬂhD coding region ) , the P5 promoter ( fragment 3 ; nucleotides 588 to 388 upstream from the ﬂhD coding region and fragment 3 = nucleo-tides 668 to 462 upstream from the ﬂhD coding region ) , and a control sequence outside the ﬂhDC promoter region within the coding sequence of ﬂhDC ( designated ﬂhDC coding ; nucleo-tides 403 to 672 downstream from the ﬂhD start codon ) were analyzed according to the schematic in Fig. 2A . 
As shown by the results in Fig. 2B , we observed binding of increasing concentrations of puriﬁed HilD protein to DNA fragments comprising the P5 promoter ( fragment 3 and 3 =) . 
Increasing amounts of HilD decreased the amount of free DNA , while the amount of HilDbound DNA increased . 
Control DNAs ( gyrA and ﬂhDC coding ) did not bind to puriﬁed HilD , and neither did the ﬂhDC promoter fragments 1 and 2 . 
We next performed DNase I footprinting to precisely map the HilD binding site in the ﬂhDC P5 promoter region . 
An ﬂhDC promoter fragment comprising nucleotides 668 to 388 upstream from the ﬂhDC coding region was incubated with increasing concentrations of puriﬁed HilD protein and , after partial digestion with DNase I , the resulting fragments were subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis ( Fig. 3A ) . 
We identiﬁed a region from 68 to 24 nucleotides upstream from the transcriptional start site of the P5 ﬂhDC promoter that was protected from DNase I digestion in the presence of HilD . 
In addition , the presence of HilD resulted in an enhancement of DNase cleavage at nucleotides 51 , 33 , 28 , and 27 upstream from the P5 transcriptional start , which indicates a potential DNA bend ( Fig. 3A and B ) . 
Comparison of known HilD binding sites from the rtsA , hilC , hilD , and hilA promoters ( 64 ) with the identiﬁed P5 PﬂhDC binding site revealed several nucleotides that were conserved between these sites ( Fig. 3C , consensus ; uppercase letters indicate predominant nucleotides [ 80 % conserved ] , and lowercase letters indicate conserved nucleotides [ 60 % conserved ] ) . 
Similar to the data of Olekhnovich and Kadner ( 64 ) , the 45-bp consensus sequence harbors two direct repeats of CNatTNtTNTA ( uppercase and lowercase are as deﬁned for Fig. 3C ) .

DISCUSSION
In a previous study , we investigated the feedback regulation occurring at the level of the ﬂagellar master regulator ﬂhDC . 
Using a genetic screen , we identiﬁed RﬂM as a negative regulator of ﬂhDC transcription and demonstrated that the FlhDC complex activated rﬂM expression in a regulatory feedback loop ( 26 ) . 
Another class of transposon insertions that we obtained from our screen for regulators affecting ﬂhDC autorepression resulted in overexpression of the hilD gene . 
This suggested a role of the Spi1 activator HilD in regulation of the ﬂagellar master operon ﬂhDC . 
In the present study , we show that HilD acts as a direct activator of ﬂhDC expression via activation of the P5 transcriptional start site , thus revealing a novel transcriptional cross talk between the ﬂagellar and virulence regulons in Salmonella . 
Importantly , a recent study by Kroeger et al. ( 65 ) analyzed the Salmonella transcriptome under 22 different infection-relevant environmental conditions . 
The RNA-sequencing data of this study reveal speciﬁc activation of the ﬂhDC P5 promoter only under Spi1-inducing conditions . 
In addition , the P5 transcriptional start site and the upstream HilD binding site appear not to be present in Escherichia coli , indicating that HilD-dependent activation of ﬂhDC evolved concurrently after horizontal gene transfer of Spi1 in Salmonella . 
The transcriptional cross talk between the ﬂagellar and Spi1 virulence regulons is complex , with several regulatory feedback mechanisms implemented on various levels ( Fig. 4 ) . 
The negative regulator of ﬂagellar class 1 gene expression , RﬂM , is activated by the FlhDC protein complex , which additionally activates the expression of genes transcribed from ﬂagellar class 2 promoters , including ﬂiZ . 
FliZ protein is a posttranscriptional regulator of HilD protein . 
HilD acts in a positive-feed-back loop together with HilC and RtsA to activate HilA and as an activator of ﬂagellar class 1 gene expression through activation of the ﬂhDC P5 promoter , as described in this work . 
RtsB is another Spi1-related regulator that is encoded in an operon together with rtsA and functions as a repressor of ﬂagellar class 1 gene expression through repression of ﬂhDC transcription at the level of the P1 promoter . 
What might be the physiological relevance of this complex cross-regulation network ? 
At the moment , this is unclear , but for the initiation of infection , motility plays a crucial role . 
Therefore , we speculate that the transcriptional link between the ﬂagellar and virulence systems is of importance during a speciﬁc step in the Salmonella infection cycle , as outlined below . 
The Spi1 and Spi2 virulence-associated genes are transcribed at different stages during Salmonella infection . 
In the insect patho-gen Xenorhabdus nematophila , hemolysin production and a full virulence phenotype have been reported to be dependent on the ﬂagellar protein FliZ , and mutants with mutations of ﬂiAZ or ﬂhDC had attenuated virulence ( 66 ) . 
For the food-borne patho-gen Salmonella , FliZ was previously described to posttranslationally modify the Spi1 regulator HilD , forwarding a positive effect to HilA , the transcriptional activator of Spi1 structural genes ( 41 -- 44 ) . 
However , recent data suggested that only a few of the known mechanisms involved in Spi1 regulation are in fact FliZ dependent ( 67 ) . 
Transcriptional regulation between the Spi1 system , the related ﬂagella , and the type I ﬁmbria systems have been subject to intensive research within the last few years . 
However , the detailed mechanisms are not well understood . 
Saini et al. ( 68 ) recently described the cross-regulation between the three systems to constitute a gene expression hierarchy that has the expression of ﬂa-gellar genes at the top of a complex cascade . 
Fimbrial genes are repressed during ﬂagellar gene expression and vice versa . 
At the same time , ﬂagellar gene expression increased the expression of Spi1 genes ( 68 ) . 
However , it was shown that overproduction of the Spi1-related protein RtsB completely abolished ﬂgA promoter activity , which can be explained by repression of the ﬂagellar master regulatory operon ﬂhDC . 
Saini et al. ( 68 ) argued that the loss of ﬂagellar gene expression and motility , which is downregulated during intracellular growth , would correspond to the bacterium 's need to stay nonmotile after successful invasion . 
In this paper , however , we identiﬁed the Spi1 regulator HilD as a positive regulator of ﬂagellar class 1 gene expression . 
The activation of the ﬂagellar system via HilD and simultaneous inactivation via RtsB argue for a dual or even multiprocess interplay between ﬂagellar and Spi1 regulation . 
Thus , depending on the environmental niche and spatiotemporal stage of infection , the Spi1 regulator HilD could activate ﬂhDC transcription through direct binding to the ﬂhDC promoter or repress ﬂhDC transcription via activation of RtsB . 
We postulate that during the early stages of epithelial cell infection , Spi1 gene expression is induced and motility is downregulated but ﬂagellar genes are in a state ready to be immediately upregulated at some later time during infection by activation via HilD . 
The secretion of bacterial Spi1 effectors results in the internalization of Salmonella cells and formation of Salmonella-containing vacuoles . 
At this point , motility is probably no longer required or could hinder the infection process . 
In epithelial cells , ﬂagellar proteins were downregulated during early infection ( 2 h p.i. ) , while the simultaneous expression of Spi1 and ﬂagellar genes 4 to 6 h postinfection ( resembling the late stages of infection ) has been reported ( 39 ) . 
Earlier results by Cummings et al. showed heterogeneous FliC expression by 60 % of the bacterial population in Peyer 's patches 7 days p.i. ( 38 ) . 
However , as soon as eukaryotic host cells burst or lyse , the bacteria released seek further host cells for infection . 
At this stage , it might be advantageous for the bacteria to have ﬂagellar gene expression ready to allow for a fast switch back into a motile state that could be mediated by activation of the ﬂagellar regulon via HilD . 
This argument is also supported by the results of Sano et al. ( 69 ) , who observed the requirement for ﬂagella in order for Salmonella to exit host macrophages . 
Accordingly , ﬂagellum-negative cells were unable to escape from host cells . 
During the ﬁrst 2 h of macrophage infection , intracellular Salmonella cells were nonﬂagellated , whereas ﬂagellum reexpression was observed 4 h later , an effect also previously reported in Legionella pneumophila ( 70 ) . 
Together , these results argue in favor of a HilD-mediated de novo synthesis of ﬂagella during some later step in the infection process . 
While many questions remain , analysis of the temporal course of gene expression will be crucial to understand the interplay between motility and virulence in detail . 
Further research will need to focus on the aspects of gene regulation during different stages of the infection process and will need to give consideration to other cross-connected players , like the link to Spi2 and ﬁmbria genes . 
Together , these studies will give a detailed picture of the steady state and the spatiotemporal interplay between the ﬂagellar and virulence-associated regulons during Salmonella infection .
