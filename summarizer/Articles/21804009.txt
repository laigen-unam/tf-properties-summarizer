YdiV acts as an anti-FlhD4C2 factor , which negatively regulates the class 2 ﬂagellar operons in poor medium in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium . 
On the other hand , one of the class 2 ﬂagellar genes , ﬂiZ , encodes a positive regulator of the class 2 operons . 
In this study , we found that the FliZ-dependent activation of class 2 operon expression was more profound in poor medium than in rich medium and not observed in the ydiV mutant background . 
Transcription of the ydiV gene was shown to increase in the ﬂiZ mutant . 
Puriﬁed FliZ protein was shown in vitro to bind to the promoter region of the nlpC gene , which is located just upstream of the ydiV gene , and to repress its transcription . 
These results indicate that FliZ is a repressor of the nlpC-ydiV operon and activates the class 2 operons by repressing ydiV expression . 
Therefore , the ﬂiZ and ydiV genes form a regulatory loop . 
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium cells swim by means of rotating ﬂagella through their environment . 
The individual ﬂagellum consists of three structural parts , a basal body , a hook , and a ﬁlament . 
More than 50 genes are specifically required for ﬂagellar formation and function ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 26 ) . 
These genes are organized into at least 15 operons , and their transcriptional expression forms a highly organized threetiered cascade called a ﬂagellar regulon ( 22 , 27 ) . 
The ﬂhDC operon is the sole one belonging to class 1 and encodes FlhD and FlhC , which assemble into an FlhD4C2 heterohexamer acting as an activator of class 2 operons ( 31 , 42 ) . 
Class 2 contains operons encoding component proteins for the hookbasal body structure and the ﬂagellum-speciﬁc type III export apparatus as well as a gene encoding the ﬂagellum-speciﬁc sigma factor 28 ( FliA ) , essential for class 3 expression ( 33 ) . 
Class 3 operons encode proteins involved in ﬁlament assembly and ﬂagellar function . 
28 activity is negatively controlled by an anti- 28 factor , FlgM ( 15 , 24 , 34 ) , which is excreted from the cell through the ﬂagellum-speciﬁc type III export apparatus upon completion of hook-basal body assembly ( 11 , 19 ) . 
Class 2 operons are transcribed by 70 RNA polymerase in the presence of the FlhD4C2 complex , which binds to the DNA region upstream of the class 2 promoter ( 13 , 30 , 31 ) . 
Two genes within the ﬂagellar regulon , ﬂiT and ﬂiZ , have been shown to be involved in ﬁne control of the class 2 operons ( 23 ) . 
The ﬂiT and ﬂiZ genes belong to the ﬂiDST and ﬂiAZ operons , respectively , both of which are transcribed from both class 2 and class 3 promoters ( 12 , 21 , 46 ) . 
FliT acts as an anti-FlhD4C2 factor , which binds to the FlhD4C2 complex through interaction with the FlhC subunit and inhibits its binding to the class

2 promoter , resulting in decreased expression of the class 2 operons ( 45 ) . 
On the other hand , FliZ was shown to be a positive regulator of class 2 operons ( 23 ) and to participate in a positive-feedback loop that induces a kinetic switch in class 2 operon expression ( 38 ) . 
Although class 2 operon expression is inhibited in vivo by the ﬂiZ mutation ( 23 ) , transcription from the class 2 promoter occurs efﬁciently in vitro in the absence of FliZ ( 13 , 31 ) . 
This suggests that FliZ affects indirectly the activation process of the class 2 operons . 
On the basis of the observation that the ﬂiZ mutation decreased the amount of FlhC without having a signiﬁcant effect on the transcription and translation of the ﬂhC gene , Saini et al. ( 37 ) proposed that FliZ is a posttranslational activator of FlhD4C2 . 
However , the molecular mechanism underlying FliZ control of the class 2 operons has remained obscure . 
The ﬂiZ mutation has also been shown to impact several cellular processes unrelated to ﬂagellar biogenesis in Salmo-nella . 
For example , the ﬂiZ mutation decreases the transcriptional expression of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) genes ( 14 ) through affecting the activity of their positive regulator , HilD ( 5 , 17 ) . 
On the other hand , the ﬂiZ mutation increases type 1 ﬁmbrial gene expression through affecting posttranscriptionally the activity of the positive regulator FimZ ( 6 , 39 ) . 
Furthermore , in Escherichia coli , FliZ was shown to affect curli expression by interfering with RpoS , the stationary-phase-speciﬁc factor ( 35 ) . 
However , the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these FliZ controls are also still unclear . 
Recently , we found that a nonﬂagellar gene , ydiV , encodes another anti-FlhD4C2 factor ( 41 ) . 
YdiV binds to FlhD4C2 by interacting with the FlhD subunit , resulting in inhibition of class 2 operon expression . 
The intracellular level of YdiV is higher in poor medium than in rich medium , which allows YdiV to act as a mediator of the nutritional level of the environment in the expression of the ﬂagellar regulon . 
Nutritional control of YdiV expression was shown to be executed mainly at the translational level ( 41 ) . 
On the other hand , Wozniak et al. ( 43 ) reported that ydiV transcription is under the negative regulation of the ﬂhDC genes , suggesting that some gene ( s ) within the ﬂagellar regulon may act as a negative regulator of the ydiV gene . 
In this study , we showed that FliZ-dependent activation of class 2 operon expression was more profound in poor medium than in rich medium and not observed in the ydiV mutant background . 
This suggested the possibility that FliZ control of class 2 operon expression is exerted via the regulatory pathway of ydiV expression . 
Gel mobility shift assay and in vivo and in vitro transcription analyses revealed that FliZ binds to the promoter region of the nlpC-ydiV operon and acts as a repressor of its transcription . 
Therefore , FliZ-dependent activation of class 2 operon expression is achieved by repression of the ydiV gene by FliZ .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains , plasmids , chemicals , and culture media . 
The Salmonella strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively . 
All the Salmonella strains used were derivatives of a standard laboratory strain , LT2 . 
Their construction procedures are described below . 
P22-mediated transduction was performed as described previously ( 25 , 28 ) . 
Unless otherwise spec-iﬁed , all the chemicals and DNA enzymes used were purchased from Nacalai Tesque ( Kyoto , Japan ) and Toyobo ( Osaka , Japan ) , respectively . 
Oligonucleo-tide primers used were purchased from Life Technologies ( Tokyo , Japan ) and are summarized in Table 3 . 
The rich and poor media used were Luria broth ( LB ) and M9 minimal medium ( 32 ) supplemented with 0.2 % glycerol and 0.2 % Casa-mino Acids ( MGC ) , respectively ( 41 ) . 
Hard-agar and motility agar plates were prepared by adding 1.2 % and 0.25 % agar ( Shoei , Tokyo , Japan ) , respectively , to LB or MGC . 
Ampicillin , kanamycin , and tetracycline were used at ﬁnal concentrations of 50 , 50 , and 20 g/ml , respectively . 
Where required , arabinose or isopropyl - - D-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) was added to the culture media at ﬁnal concentrations of 0.2 % or 0.1 mM , respectively . 
Construction of chromosomal deletion mutants . 
The Red recombination system ( 7 ) was used for construction of chromosomal in-frame deletion mutants . 
Double deletion mutants were constructed by P22-mediated transduction . 
An in-frame deletion mutant of the ﬂiA gene ( KK1004iA ) was constructed as follows . 
The kanamycin resistance Flp recombination target ( FRT ) cassette was PCR ampliﬁed from pKD13 with primers ﬂiAH1P1 and ﬂiAH2P4 , which possess sequences homologous to the 5 - and 3 - end-ﬂanking regions of the ﬂiA gene , respectively . 
The ampliﬁed product was introduced into KK1004 harboring pKD46 by electroporation , and kanamycin-resistant colonies were selected on LB agar plates containing kanamycin and arabinose . 
After the correct replacement of the ﬂiA gene with the kanamycin resistance gene cassette was conﬁrmed , this mutation was moved to fresh KK1004 via P22-mediated transduction . 
The kan gene was removed through site-speciﬁc recombination between the ﬂanking FRT sequences by transient exposure of the mutant cells to pCP20 . 
Similarly , an in-frame deletion of the ﬂiZ gene ( resulting in strain KK1004iZ ) was carried out using primers ﬂiZH1P1 and ﬂiZH2P4 , which possess sequences homologous to the 5 - and 3 - end-ﬂanking regions of the ﬂiZ gene , respectively . 
Through the same procedure , an in-frame deletion of the ﬂiAZ operon ( resulting in strain KK1004iAZ ) was carried out using primers ﬂiAH1P1 and ﬂiZH2P4 . 
Plasmid construction . 
The ﬂiZ gene was PCR ampliﬁed with primers IZP1 and SalIﬂiZR using genomic DNA from KK1004 as a template . 
The ampliﬁed product was digested with BamHI and SalI and inserted into the corresponding site of pQE80L or pQE80K to obtain pQE80L-ﬂiZ or pQE80K-ﬂiZ , respectively . 
They encode an N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged FliZ protein ( His6-FliZ ) . 
Introduction of these plasmids restored full motility to the cells of KK1004iZ ( ﬂiZ ) ( data not shown ) , indicating that the His6-FliZ protein is functional . 
The ﬂhC and ﬂhD genes were separately PCR ampliﬁed with primers HCf1B and HCr1S and HDf1S and HDr1P , respectively , using genomic DNA from KK1004 as a template . 
The ampliﬁed ﬂhC DNA was digested with BamHI and SalI , while the ampliﬁed ﬂhD DNA was digested with SalI and PstI . 
These two DNA fragments were inserted together into the BamHI/PstI site of pQE80L to obtain pQE80L-ﬂhCD . 
This plasmid encodes an N-terminally hexahistidinetagged FlhC protein ( His6-FlhC ) and a nontagged FlhD protein . 
Introduction of this plasmid restored full motility to the cells of KK1004hDC ( ﬂhD : : Tn10 ) ( data not shown ) , indicating that both the His6-FlhC and FlhD proteins encoded by this plasmid are functional . 
The promoter region of the ﬂiAZ operon was PCR ampliﬁed with primers KpnIﬂiA0 and IAEIB using genomic DNA from KK1004 as a template . 
The ampliﬁed product was digested with KpnI and BamHI and inserted into the corresponding site of pFZY1 to obtain pFZY1-PﬂiA-lacZ . 
In this plasmid , the lacZ gene is transcribed from the class 2 and class 3 promoters of the ﬂiAZ operon ( PﬂiA ) . 
The promoter region of the nlpC gene was PCR ampliﬁed with primers PnlpCf1E and PnlpCr1B using the genomic DNA from KK1004 as a template . 
The ampliﬁed product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into the corresponding site of pQE80L . 
In order to delete the T5 promoter on the vector sequence , the resulting plasmid was digested with XhoI and EcoRI , blunt ended with the Klenow fragment , and then self-ligated . 
In the resulting plasmid , pQE80L - PT5-PnlpC , transcription initiates at the nlpC promoter ( PnlpC ) and terminates at the T0 terminator on the vector sequence , yielding an RNA product of 184 or 183 bases . 
Similarly , the same region was PCR ampliﬁed with primers PnlpCf2E and PnlpCr2B or NLPCF and PnlpCr2B , digested with EcoRI and BamHI , and inserted into the corresponding site of pFZY1 to obtain pFZY1-PnlpC-lacZ or pFZY1 - PnlpC-lacZ , respectively . 
In pFZY1-PnlpC-lacZ , the lacZ gene is transcriptionally fused to PnlpC . 
pFZY1 - PnlpC-lacZ has the same structure as pFZY1-PnlpC-lacZ except that it lacks the PnlpC region . 
- Galactosidase enzyme assay . 
- Galactosidase activity was assayed as described previously ( 20 ) using cells grown aerobically to exponential phase at 37 °C in LB or MGC containing appropriate antibiotics . 
Each sample was assayed in triplicate . 
Protein analysis . 
Cells were grown to exponential phase at 37 °C in LB or MGC , and the cultures were directly subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) . 
SDS-PAGE and Western blottin of proteins were performed according to the method described previously ( 24 ) . 
FliC ( ﬂagellin ) was detected with an anti-FliC polyclonal antibody and an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , CA ) using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system ( GE Healthcare , NJ ) . 
FLAG-tagged proteins were detected with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody ( Sigma , MO ) and an anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . 
Afﬁnity puriﬁcation of His6-FliZ . 
His6-FliZ protein synthesized in E. coli strain BL21 slyD ( laboratory stock ) harboring pQE80L-ﬂiZ was afﬁnity puriﬁed according to the method described previously ( 44 ) . 
The puriﬁed protein exhibited a single band at a position corresponding to approximately 21 kDa in an SDS-PAGE gel ( data not shown ) . 
In vitro transcription . 
In vitro RNA synthesis was performed using E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme ( Epicenter , WI ) according to the method described previously ( 41 , 44 ) . 
The reaction mixture contained 40 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 150 mM KCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 10 mM MgCl2 , 50 U of RNase inhibitor , 100 M ( each ) ATP , GTP , and CTP , 50 M UTP with 4 105 Bq [ -32 P ] UTP ( Institute of Isotopes , Budapest , Hungary ) , 1 g of template DNA , 1 U of RNA polymerase , and various concentrations ( 0 to 1,250 nM ) of His6-FliZ . 
Mixtures without substrates were prepared in a 45 - l volume and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min . 
The reaction was initiated by addition of 5 l prewarmed substrate mixture . 
After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min , the reaction was terminated by adding 50 l of a stop solution ( 0.6 M sodium acetate [ pH 5.5 ] , 20 mM EDTA , 200 g tRNA/ml ) . 
The transcripts were extracted with phenol and then precipitated with ethanol . 
The precipitated materials were electrophoretically separated in an 8 % polyacrylamide gel containing 6 M urea . 
The labeled transcripts were visualized by autoradiography . 
Gel mobility shift assay . 
A 287-bp DNA fragment containing PnlpC was PCR ampliﬁed from the KK1004 genomic DNA using primers PnlpCf2E and PnlpCr2B . 
The ampliﬁed product was gel puriﬁed and then labeled at the 5 end with [ -32 P ] ATP ( Institute of Isotopes ) by T4 polynucleotide kinase and used as a probe . 
The DNA-binding activity of His6-FliZ was assayed according to a method described previously ( 41 ) . 
The binding reaction mixture ( 20 l ) contained a 0.2 nM concentration of the labeled probe DNA , 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8.0 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 0.1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM MgCl2 , 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin , 5 % glycerol , and various concentrations ( 0 to 250 nM ) of His6-FliZ . 
The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and subjected to electrophoresis on a native 5 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 TBE buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 25 mM boric acid , 1 mM EDTA ) . 
Labeled DNAs were detected by autoradiography .

RESULTS
FliZ is required for efﬁcient ﬂagellar production in poor medium . 
We showed previously that a disruption of the ﬂiZ gene reduced class 2 operon expression more than 5-fold ( 23 ) , whereas Saini et al. ( 37 ) reported that the ﬂiZ mutation had only a moderate effect on class 2 operon expression . 
We noted that the culture media used were different between these two studies ; that is , Kutsukake et al. used MGC , whereas Saini et al. used LB . 
This suggested the possibility that the effect of the ﬂiZ mutation on ﬂagellar production is inﬂuenced by the nutritional condition . 
In order to test this possibility , we examined ﬁrst more carefully the effect of the ﬂiZ mutation on class 2 transcription with the cells grown in LB and MGC . 
For this purpose , we used the PﬂiA-lacZ transcriptional fusion gene on the single-copy plasmid pFZY1-PﬂiA-lacZ . 
The PﬂiA DNA contains both class 2 and class 3 promoters of the ﬂiAZ operon . 
Therefore , in order to avoid transcription from the class 3 promoter , all the host strains that we used for this study possessed an in-frame deletion of the ﬂiA gene . 
As shown in Table 4 , the effect of the ﬂiZ mutation on - galactosidase activity was more pronounced in MGC ( more than 5-fold ) than in LB ( less than 2-fold ) . 
Next , we examined motility and ﬂagellin ( FliC ) production in LB and MGC . 
As shown in Fig. 1 , the effect of the ﬂiZ mutation on motility and ﬂagellin level was also more pronounced in MGC than in LB . 
These results indicate that Sal-monella cells require FliZ for efﬁcient ﬂagellar synthesis more strictly in poor medium than in rich medium . 
FliZ acts in a regulatory pathway upstream of YdiV . 
Saini et al. ( 37 ) reported that the ﬂiZ deletion caused an approximately 50 % decrease in the FlhC-3 FLAG protein level in rich me-dium . 
Therefore , there is a possibility that inhibition of class a - Galactosidase activity was assayed with strains harboring pFZY1-PﬂiA-lacZ . 
b Strains used were ydiV ﬂiA ﬂiZ strain KK1004iA , ydiV ﬂiA ﬂiZ strain KK1004iAZ , strain KK1004ViA , and mutant ydiV ﬂiA ﬂiZ ydiV ﬂiA ﬂiZ KK1004ViAZ . 
, the gene is deleted . 
operon expression by the ﬂiZ mutation in poor medium might be due to the decreased level of the FlhC protein . 
However , we could not observe any signiﬁcant effect of the ﬂiZ mutation on the FlhC-3 FLAG protein level in MGC ( data not shown ) . 
Therefore , FliZ-dependent activation of class 2 operon expression is unlikely to be mediated by modulation of the intracellular FlhD4C2 level , at least in the strains used here . 
Since YdiV was shown to be a mediator of the nutritional cue to ﬂagellar synthesis ( 41 ) , the above-mentioned results raised the possibility that YdiV is involved in the ﬂiZ-mediated regulation of the ﬂagellar regulon . 
In order to test this , the effect of the ﬂiZ mutation on ﬂagellar gene expression was

examined in the absence of YdiV . 
As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 4 , the negative effects of the ﬂiZ mutation on motility , ﬂagellin production , and class 2 gene transcription in MGC were all relieved in the ydiV mutant background . 
These results suggest the hypothesis that FliZ acts upstream of YdiV on the common regulatory pathway . 
In order to further conﬁrm this , the effect of FliZ overexpression from pQE80K-ﬂiZ on class 2 operon transcription was examined with the strains harboring pFZY1-PﬂiA-lacZ ( Table 4 ) . 
Introduction of the empty vector pQE80K enhanced PﬂiA-lacZ expression . 
This is consistent with a previous report showing that the lacI gene on the plasmid upregulates at least some ﬂagellar genes ( 8 ) . 
In the ydiV background , FliZ overexpression enhanced PﬂiA-lacZ expression 5-fold . 
In contrast , FliZ overexpression had no signiﬁcant effect on PﬂiA-lacZ expression in the absence of YdiV . 
These results conform to the hypothesis mentioned above . 
Taken together , we conclude that the FliZ protein is a direct or indirect antagonist of the antiFlhD4C2 factor YdiV in transcriptional control of the class 2 ﬂagellar operons . 
Interestingly , overexpression of FliZ in the ydiV strain did not attain a level of expression of PﬂiA-lacZ equivalent to its expression level in the ydiV mutant . 
This is discussed below . 
FliZ negatively regulates transcription of the ydiV gene . 
As described in the introduction , Wozniak et al. ( 43 ) reported that ydiV transcription is under the negative regulation of the ﬂhDC genes . 
Since their experiment was carried out in rich medium , we examined the effect of the ﬂhD mutation on ydiV transcription in poor medium . 
As shown in Table 5 , when the cells of the strain carrying the ydiV-lacZ transcriptional fusion gene on the chromosome were grown in MGC , the ﬂhD : : Tn10 mutation increased - galactosidase activity 2.4-fold . 
Since the ﬂiZ gene is under the positive control of FlhD4C2 ( 12 , 23 ) , FliZ is one of the most plausible candidates of the regulator involved in FlhD4C2 control of the ydiV gene . 
In order to test this , the effect of the ﬂiZ mutation on ydiV-lacZ expression was examined ( Table 5 ) . 
As expected , the ﬂiZ mutation increased - galactosidase activity about 2-fold . 
Ectopic expression of FliZ from pQE80L-ﬂiZ in the ﬂhD : : Tn10 mutant resulted in decreased - galactosidase activity , whereas that of FlhC and FlhD from pQE80L-ﬂhCD in the ﬂiZ mutant had no signiﬁcant effect on enzyme activity ( Table 5 ) . 
These results indicate that FlhD4C2 affects ydiV expression through its pos itive control of ﬂiZ expression . 
It should be noted that the chromosomal ydiV-lacZ fusion gene was not completely turned off by FliZ expression from pQE80L-ﬂiZ ( Table 5 ) . 
This is consistent with the result shown in Table 4 . 
These results suggest that both FliZ-sensitive and FliZ-insensitive transcriptions are responsible for ydiV expression . 
This is discussed further below . 
Because YdiV inhibits ﬂiZ expression by acting as an antiFlhD4C2 factor ( 41 ) , the above-described result suggests that the ydiV gene should be autogenously activated . 
As expected , YdiV overexpression from pQE80L-ydiV enhanced ydiV-lacZ expression , and the ﬂhD or ﬂiZ mutation did not enhance further its expression ( Table 5 ) . 
FliZ represses ydiV transcription from the nlpC promoter . 
The ydiV gene is located just downstream of the nlpC gene ( Fig. 2 ) . 
Jonas et al. ( 16 ) reported results suggesting that two promoters located within the nlpC-ydiV intergenic region may be responsible for ydiV transcription . 
Recently , however , we showed that these promoters are inactive in our strains and that the ydiV gene is transcribed mainly from a promoter , PnlpC , located upstream of the nlpC gene ( 41 ) . 
Therefore , in this study , we examined the structure and function of PnlpC further . 
A bioinformatics study using the software Neural Network Promoter Prediction ( http://www.fruitﬂy.org / seq_tools / promoter.html ) ( 36 ) suggested one 70-type promoter sequence , TTGAAA-N18-TAAATT , whose predicted transcriptional start site is nucleotide C or A at bp position 30 or 29 upstream of the start codon of the nlpC gene ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Unfortunately , our attempts to identify the transcriptional start site of the nlpC gene by primer extension analysis of mRNA or by the RNA ligation-mediated reverse transcription-PCR method were unsuccessful for unknown reasons . 
So , we analyzed the activity of PnlpC using a single-copy promoter-probe vector , pFZY1 . 
DNA fragments containing the upstream region of the nlpC gene with and without this promoter-like sequence were inserted into pFZY1 to obtain pFZY1-PnlpC-lacZ and pFZY1-PnlpC-lacZ , respectively ( Fig. 2B ) . 
In the wild-type cells grown in MGC , - galactosidase activity was more than 20-fold higher from pFZY1-PnlpC-lacZ ( 310 37 Miller units ) than from pFZY1 - PnlpC-lacZ ( 15 5 Miller units ) , suggesting that this promoter-like sequence is functional in Salmonella . 
Next , we analyzed the effect of the ﬂiZ mutation on - ga-lactosidase activity from pFZY1-PnlpC-lacZ . 
In order to avoid any possible effect of YdiV on transcription from PnlpC through the ydiV-ﬂiZ regulatory loop , - galactosidase activity was assayed in the ydiV mutant background . 
As a result , the enzyme activity was higher in the ydiV ﬂiZ deletion strain ( 272 51 Miller units ) than in the ydiV ﬂiZ strain ( 38 9 Miller units ) , indicating that this promoter is responsive to negative regulation by FliZ . 
Note that , in the presence of FliZ , the enzyme activity was much lower in the ydiV mutant than in the wildtype strain . 
This indicates that YdiV activates its own expression by inhibiting FliZ expression . 
Furthermore , in the ydiV ﬂiZ background , the enzyme activity from the chromosomal ydiV-lacZ fusion gene ( Table 5 ) was higher than that from pFZY1-PnlpC-lacZ , which suggests an additional promoter for ydiV expression on the chromosome . 
This promoter may be responsible for the FliZ-insensitive transcription of the ydiV gene described above . 
FliZ is a repressor for the nlpC promoter . 
PnlpC activity was analyzed further by an in vitro transcription experiment using plasmid pQE80L - PT5-PnlpC as a template . 
If the above prediction about the transcriptional start site is correct , a 184 - or 183-nucleotide transcript is expected to be produced by transcription from PnlpC in this plasmid . 
In the presence of 70 RNA polymerase , an RNA product of about 190 nucleotides was produced in addition to a 107-nucleotide RNA I derived from the vector sequence ( Fig. 3 , lane 2 ) . 
This result indicates the validity of the above-mentioned prediction for PnlpC . 
In order to analyze the function of the FliZ protein in vitro , we puriﬁed the His6-FliZ protein from E. coli cells harboring pQE80L-ﬂiZ and examined its effect on in vitro transcription from PnlpC . 
An empty vector , pQE80L , was also included in the reaction mixture as a control template , which produces a 230-nucleotide RNA from the T5 promoter . 
Addition of the puri-ﬁed His6-FliZ protein into the reaction mixture reduced the amount of the nlpC transcript in a concentration-dependent manner , whereas that of the RNA product from the T5 promoter was not affected ( Fig. 3 , lanes 3 to 6 ) . 
This result indicates that FliZ speciﬁcally represses transcription from PnlpC . 
Interestingly , at the highest concentration of His6-FliZ used in this study , the amount of RNA I was also somewhat reduced ( Fig. 3 , lane 6 ) . 
This is discussed below . 
FliZ is known to contain a SAM ( sterile alpha motif ) - like phage integrase domain ( 37 ) , suggesting the possibility that FliZ has a DNA-binding ability . 
In order to test this , gel mobility shift assay of the 32P-labeled DNA fragment containing PnlpC was performed in the presence of the puriﬁed His6-FliZ protein . 
A shifted band was observed in the presence of His6-FliZ , and its amount increased in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig. 4 , lanes 2 to 5 ) . 
Band shift was not observed wit the 32P-labeled DNA fragment lacking P ( data not shown ) , nlpC indicating that FliZ binds speciﬁcally to the DNA region containing P . 
Binding speciﬁcity was further examined by a nlpC competition experiment using unlabeled DNAs as competitors . 
An unlabeled DNA fragment containing P behaved as an nlpC effective competitor ( Fig. 4 , lane 7 ) , whereas an unlabeled DNA fragment without P did not ( Fig. 4 , lane 8 ) , indicating nlpC the high speciﬁcity of FliZ binding to the DNA region containing P .

DISCUSSION
We showed that FliZ is required for efﬁcient expression of the class 2 ﬂagellar operons in poor medium in Salmonella ( Table 4 ) . 
Although Saini et al. ( 37 ) reported data suggesting that FliZ functions at the posttranslational level of FlhD C by 4 2 regulating its stability , we could not observe any signiﬁcant effect of the ﬂiZ mutation on the FlhC protein level ( data not shown ) . 
Instead , we showed that FliZ binds to the promoter region of the nlpC-ydiV operon and represses its transcription ( Fig. 3 and 4 ) , which results in the decreased expression of the ydiV gene , encoding an anti-FlhD4C2 factor . 
Our current model depicting a regulatory pathway involving FliZ and YdiV is summarized in Fig. 5A . 
According to this model , the ﬂiZ and ydiV genes form a regulatory loop and are differentially expressed in response to nutritional cues . 
Since ydiV expression is enhanced in poor medium at the translational step ( 41 ) , an increased level of the YdiV protein would activate its own transcription by inhibiting the FlhD4C2-depen-dent expression of the ﬂiZ gene . 
Under this condition , the ﬂagellar operons stay at a low expression level . 
On the other hand , in a rich nutritional environment where the amount of the YdiV protein is low , the FlhD4C2 complex is free from inhibition by YdiV , resulting in high expression of the FliZ protein , which in turn represses ydiV expression . 
This leads the ﬂagellar operons to the actively expressed state . 
Thus , the FliZ-YdiV regulatory loop has a stable bipartite expression proﬁle in switching between highly and weakly motile lifestyles in responding to nutrient availability ( Fig. 5B ) . 
In this study , we analyzed ydiV expression by focusing on the PnlpC promoter , which is susceptible to FliZ repression . 
However , as described above , we suggest that an additional promoter insensitive to FliZ repression may also be involved in ydiV transcription . 
We anticipate that transcriptional read-through from the btuCED operon upstream of the nlpC gene may be responsible for this transcription , because there is no apparent - independent terminator-like sequence in the intergenic region between the btuD and nlpC genes ( Fig. 2A ) . 
FliZ is known to regulate the SPI1 genes positively ( 5 , 14 , 17 ) and the type 1 ﬁmbrial genes negatively ( 6 , 39 ) . 
FliZ control of these genes was observed in rich medium , in which YdiV expression must be low . 
Therefore , it is reasonable to predict that this FliZ control may not be affected by the ydiV mutation . 
This prediction is consistent with the previous observation that the expression of one of the SPI1 genes , sipC , was not affected by the ydiV mutation ( 10 ) . 
Therefore , we believe that FliZ control of these genes is not mediated by YdiV . 
FliZ may regulate these genes through a mechanism different from that of FliZ control of the ﬂagellar genes 
FIG. 4 . 
Gel mobility shift assay of the nlpC promoter DNA by FliZ . 
A 287-bp PnlpC DNA fragment containing the nlpC promoter was 5 - end labeled with 32P and used as a probe . 
Each mixture contained 0.2 nM labeled DNA . 
After incubation with His6-FliZ at the ﬁnal concentrations indicated above the lanes , the DNA-protein mixtures were separated on a native 5 % polyacrylamide gel , and labeled DNA was detected by autoradiography . 
In the competition experiments ( lanes 7 and 8 ) , 2 nM concentrations of the unlabeled P and P nlpC nlpC fragments shown in Fig. 2B were used . 
Positions of free and bound DNAs are indicated by arrows . 
FliZ from Xenorhabdus nematophila was shown to speciﬁcally bind to the promoter region of the ﬂhDC operon and to function as an activator ( 29 ) . 
Although X. nematophila FliZ shows 56 % identity with Salmonella FliZ , they differ signiﬁcantly from each other in their C-terminal sequences ( data not shown ) . 
Since FliZ is not involved in the regulation of the ﬂhDC operon in Salmonella ( 23 ) , there is a possibility that the C-terminal portion of FliZ determines its DNA-binding spec-iﬁcity . 
This possibility is supported by our preliminary experiment showing that a C-terminally truncated FliZ protein does not retain DNA-binding ability ( our unpublished result ) . 
The C-terminal portion of FliZ contains a SAM-like phage integrase domain ( 37 ) , which is also included in Cre , Flp , and XerD recombinases ( 9 ) . 
These recombinases are known to recognize palindromic sequences ( 3 , 40 ) . 
Interestingly , a 14-bp palindromic sequence ( CGTTTCTTGAAAAG , where underlining indicates complementary nucleotides ) was found also at the nlpC promoter region ( Fig. 2A ) . 
This sequence overlaps the putative 35 element of the nlpC promoter and thus may be a plausible target site of FliZ binding . 
A similar palindromic sequence ( GAGTTCTTGAAGTG ) exists around the 35 element of the RNA I promoter , whereas such a sequence is not observed at the T5 promoter region of pQE80L . 
This structural difference conforms to the results of Fig. 3 showing that the nlpC and RNA I promoters were susceptible to FliZ repression but that the T5 promoter was not . 
Identiﬁcation of a recognition sequence of FliZ will help us to understand a molecular mechanism underlying FliZ control of the ydiV gene and reveal additional targets of FliZ on the bacterial genome .
