In Salmonella , there are three classes of promoters in the ﬂagellar transcriptional hierarchy . 
This organization allows genes needed earlier in the construction of ﬂagella to be transcribed before genes needed later . 
Four operons ( ﬂiAZY , ﬂgMN , ﬂiDST , and ﬂgKL ) are expressed from both class 2 and class 3 promoters . 
To investigate the purpose for expressing genes from multiple ﬂagellar promoters , mutants were constructed for each operon that were defective in either class 2 transcription or class 3 transcription . 
The mutants were checked for defects in swimming through liquids , swarming over surfaces , and transcriptional regulation . 
The expression of the hook-associated proteins ( FlgK , FlgL , and FliD ) from class 3 promoters was found to be important for swarming motility . 
Both ﬂgMN promoters were involved in coordinating class 3 transcription with the stage of assembly of the hook-basal body . 
Finally , the ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter lowered class 3 transcription in stationary phase . 
These results indicate that the multiple ﬂagellar promoters respond to speciﬁc environmental conditions and help coordinate transcription with ﬂagellar assembly . 
Flagella provide a competitive advantage to many bacteria by enabling them to swim toward nutrients and away from harmful substances . 
Flagella are complex machines that are constructed from about two dozen structural proteins in Sal-monella and Escherichia coli ( 26 ) . 
At least two dozen additional proteins are involved in regulation , assembly , or function ( 5 ) . 
Flagellar genes in many bacterial species are organized into transcriptional hierarchies . 
These hierarchies express groups of genes at different stages during ﬂagellar biogenesis ( 32 ) . 
In Salmonella , there are three classes of ﬂagellar promoters in the transcriptional hierarchy ( 24 ) . 
The single class 1 promoter responds to information related to the metabolic and environmental state of the cell to decide when to transcribe the genes for the FlhDC activator complex . 
Together with 70 , FlhDC directs RNA polymerase to initiate transcription from class 2 promoters ( 37 ) . 
Class 2 expressed gene products are used to build the hook-basal body ( HBB ) . 
The basal body is a structure that spans the membranes and peptidoglycan layer and consists of the rotor , the rod , ringed structures , and the ﬂagellar secretion system . 
The hook is a ﬂexible , extracellular linker between the basal body and the rigid ﬁlament that acts as a propeller ( 31 ) . 
A class 2 promoter also transcribes the gene for the ﬂagellar sigma factor 28 , which directs transcription to class 3 promoters ( 29 ) . 
Class 3 promoters transcribe the genes for the ﬁlament , motor force generators , and chemosensory system . 
This organization allows genes needed earlier in the construction of ﬂagella to be transcribed before genes needed later ( 5 ) .

The regulatory protein FlgM helps coordinate the transcriptional hierarchy with the assembly status of HBBs . 
Before completion of the HBBs , FlgM binds to 28 to prevent 28 from initiating transcription at class 3 promoters . 
When the HBBs are complete , the ﬂagellar secretion apparatus switches to the secretion of ﬁlament-type substrates , such as FlgM ( 12 , 20 ) . 
Lower intracellular levels of FlgM allow 28 to turn on the class 3 promoters . 
As a result , tens of thousands of ﬁlament subunits are then produced and added onto the completed HBBs . 
This coordination by FlgM may prevent the HBB proteins and ﬁlament subunits from simultaneously competing for secretion ( 12 ) , which could slow ﬂagellar assembly . 
Moreover , not synthesizing and secreting ﬂagellar proteins before they can be assembled into the ﬂagellar structure could be an important resource conservation mechanism for the cell ( 12 , 19 , 20 ) . 
The purpose for other regulatory arrangements within the transcriptional hierarchy is less clear . 
In particular , 10 genes are expressed from both class 2 and class 3 promoters in Sal-monella ( Fig. 1 ) . 
These include the genes for activators ( 28 and FliZ ) and inhibitors ( FlgM and FliT ) of ﬂagellar transcription ( 10 , 14 , 21 ) . 
The ﬁlament cap protein FliD and the FlgK and FlgL proteins that form the junction between the hook and the ﬁlament are also expressed from both the class 2 and class 3 promoters ( 21 ) . 
FlgK , FlgL , and FliD are collectively known as the hook-associated proteins ( HAPs ) because they assemble at the end of the hook before the ﬁlament is added . 
The HAPs enable the efﬁcient polymerization of the ﬁlament subunits . 
In addition , secretion chaperones for the HAPs ( FlgN and FliT ) and the ﬁlament subunits ( FliS ) are produced from both class 2 and class 3 promoters ( 21 ) . 
While the reason for this organization has not yet been determined , most of these proteins act at the point in assembly after completion of the HBB and before polymerization of the ﬁlament . 
To investigate why ﬂagellar genes are expressed from both class 2 and class 3 promoters , mutants were constructed that were defective in either class 2 transcription or class 3 transcription for each operon . 
The mutants were tested for their ability to swim through liquids and swarm over surfaces . 
Our results indicated that the class 3 promoters for the HAPs are important during swarming and may be involved in the repair of broken ﬂagella . 
Changes in ﬂagellar gene expression were also examined using transcriptional reporters . 
The ﬂiAZY and ﬂgMN promoter helped to coordinate class 3 transcription with the stage of assembly of the HBBs .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and general techniques . 
The strains used in this study were derived from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 . 
Many of these strains are listed in Table 1 . 
Additional strains were constructed from the alleles in Table 1 and are listed in Table S1 of the supplemental material . 
Cultures of bacterial strains and phage P22 lysates were prepared as described previously ( 9 ) , except that LB ( with , per liter , 10 g Bacto tryptone , 5 g Bacto yeast extract , 5 g NaCl ) was used as a rich medium for growing bacteria , and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl - - D-galactopyranoside ( X-Gal ) was added to plates at a concentration of 40 g/ml . 
Chlortetracycline ( 50 g/ml , autoclaved ) or tetracycline ( 15 g/ml ) was used to induce transcription from the tetA promoter within the T-POP transposon , and 0.2 % arabinose was used to induce transcription from the araBAD promoter . 
Transductions and tetracycline-sensitive ( Tcs ) selections were performed as described previously ( 27 , 28 ) , except that LB was used instead of nutrient broth and Tcs selection plates were incubated at 42 °C . 
Strain constructions utilizing - Red recombination , including targeted tetRA insertions and replacements , were performed using plasmid pKD46 , as described previously ( 38 ) . 
Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies ( Coralville , IA ) and are listed in Table S2 of the supplemental material . 
PCR products were sequenced at the DNA Sequencing Facility ( Department of Biochemistry ) at the University of Washington or at the DNA Sequencing Core Facility at the University of Utah . 
Allele construction . 
Speciﬁc mutations in ﬂagellar promoters were generated using primers containing the desired mutations . 
These primers were designed with about 40 bp of homology to the promoter ( for recombination ) , then the mutation , and about 20 bp of homology to the promoter ( for ampliﬁcation ; 55 °C melting temperature ) . 
Either wild-type promoters or mutant promoters that were generated in an earlier study ( 38 ) were used as templates for ampli-ﬁcation . 
- Red recombination was used to move these mutations into the chromosome to replace tetracycline resistance markers ( 6 , 15 ) . 
The ﬂiDST class 3 promoter was mutagenized by using a primer that had a random mix of bases for four positions in the 10 region of the promoter . 
After recombination , colonies were checked for Lac activity on lactose indicator plates ( LB -- X-Gal , MacConkey-lactose , and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride-lactose plates ) . 
A colony that had wild-type class 2 transcription but was defective for class 3 transcription was chosen ( see Results ) . 
To insert transcriptional terminators immediately after the stop codons of ﬂgA and ﬂgJ , - Red recombination was used to move in 250 bp of E. coli DNA containing the strong rrnB transcriptional terminators . 
Genes were placed under the control of the arabinose promoter at the ara locus by a procedure described in an earlier study ( 39 ) . 
These constructs replace the araB start codon through the araD stop codon with the start codon through the stop codon of the cloned gene . 
The ﬂiZ6591 : : MudJ allele ( 38 ) was moved to 10 bp after the ﬂiZ stop codon . 
- Red recombinations were used to insert ﬂiZ DNA before MudJ and delete DNA after MudJ . 
There is no duplication of DNA at the ends of the resulting ﬂiZ7082 : : MudJ insertion . 
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR . 
For each strain , total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit ( Qiagen ) from each of three independent cultures grown to mid-log phase in LB medium . 
Genomic DNA was then removed by incubation with DNase I ( ZymoResearch ) for 30 min at 37 °C . 
Reverse transcription ( RT ) was performed using the RevertAid ﬁrst-strand cDNA synthesis kit ( Fermentas ) with the included random hexamers . 
Quantitative PCR mixtures consisted of the EvaGreen qPCR master mix ( Bio-Rad ) and the primers that are listed in Table S2 of the supplemental material . 
Reactions were run on a CFX96 real-time PCR instrument ( Bio-Rad ) . 
Relative changes in mRNA levels were calculated by the 2 CT method ( 25 ) with normalization to control for the genes gyrB and gapA ( 34 ) . 
Swimming and swarming plates . 
Swimming plates were prepared as described previously ( 9 ) . 
Single colonies from overnight streak plates were poked into the swimming plates by using toothpicks and incubated for 6 h . 
At least eight independent colonies were checked for each strain assayed . 
Swarming plates were used to assay the ability of cells to spread over surfaces . 
For swarming plates , swarming agar ( with , per liter , 10 g Bacto tryptone , 5 g Bacto yeast extract , 10 g NaCl , 6 g Bacto agar ) in a ﬂask was autoclaved in a pan of water to limit evaporation . 
Glucose was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 % . 
A 25-ml volume of the swarming agar was pipetted into each plate . 
The plates were spread in a single layer for even evaporation . 
After sitting at room temperature for 16 h , 5 l of an overnight culture grown in LB was spotted in the center of each plate and allowed to dry for 10 min with the lid removed . 
Plates were incubated in a single layer in a 37 °C incubator for 9 h before pictures were taken . 
To induce genes from the arabinose promoter , overnight cultures grown in LB-Ara were spotted on swarming plates containing arabinose . 
The magnetic lasso tool in Adobe Photoshop was used to trace around the irregular border of each swarm , and the number of pixels in the selected area was used to calculate an average diameter . 
The average diameter of a nonmotile strain ( TH3930 cheY5458 : : MudJ ) was subtracted from the average diameter of each strain tested . 
This distance was then normalized to the distance moved by the wild-type strain . 
For each strain , the assays were performed on three different days with three independent cultures spotted onto three swarming plates each day . 
To increase the contrast between the bacterial growth and the background , Adobe Photoshop was used to adjust the brightness levels for pictures of both swimming and swarming plates . 
Flagellar staining . 
For each sample , a 7-mm-wide chamber with about 12 - l capacity was formed from a glass slide cleaned with ethanol , a coverslip wiped with a Kimwipe , and two pieces of double-sided tape for the sides . 
Fifteen microliters of poly-L-lysine was pipetted into each chamber , and then chambers were inverted for about 3 min . 
When liquids were applied to the top of the chamber , the slide was placed at about a 45 ° angle . 
During incubations , the slides were placed upside down onto wooden sticks in a 15-cm-diameter petri dish that had wet Kimwipes around the inside perimeter to prevent the chambers from drying out . 
For the staining of swimming cells , an overnight culture was diluted 1:200 in 2 ml of LB in a test tube and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 2.5 h. Fifteen microliters of culture was applied twice to the chamber , and the slide was inverted for about 3 min . 
For the staining of swarming cells , the swarming assay was performed as described earlier . 
After 8 h of incubation at 37 °C , 10 l of phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ; 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Na2HPO4 , 3 mM KH2PO4 ; pH 7.5 ) was spotted halfway onto the edge of the swarm . 
After about 10 s , 5 l of liquid was pipetted from the surface and transferred to 1 ml of PBS in a microcentrifuge tube . 
The tube was gently inverted twice to dilute the cells . 
A new pipette tip was used to transfer 10 l to the chamber . 
The same procedure was then followed for both swimming and swarming cells . 
First , 8 l of 18 % formaldehyde in PBS was added , and the slide was inverte for 10 min . 
Next , 20 l of PBS , 20 l of 10 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in PBS , and 10 l of rabbit anti-FliC antibodies diluted 1:1,000 in PBS were sequentially applied to the chamber . 
The slide was incubated inverted at room temperature for 1 h. Then , 20 l of PBS , 20 l of 10 % BSA , and 10 l of anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 diluted 1:1,000 in PBS were sequentially added to the chamber . 
The slide was incubated inverted for 30 min at room temperature in the dark . 
Finally , 20 l of PBS and 15 l of a solution containing three parts poly-L-lysine to 1 part 5 - g/ml FM4-64 in PBS were sequentially added . 
The chamber was sealed with clear nail polish to prevent evaporation . 
Slides were examined on an Applied Precision optical sectioning microscope . 
FIG. 1 . 
Four operons in Salmonella are expressed from both class 2 and class 3 promoters . 
The arrows represent the transcripts that are generated . 
Additionally , ﬂiY is transcribed from its own nonﬂagellar promoter and has no known ﬂagellar function . 
Slides were prepared for three independent biological replicates for each strain for both swimming and swarming cells . 
After focusing the microscope on the sample , the slide was moved 100 m over and 100 m down . 
A series of six 65 - m square panels were then taken with four sections in the z-stack to span the ﬂagella . 
Before analysis , swimming panels were randomly reordered and renamed to reduce bias . 
Each panel was subjectively evaluated for the average number of ﬂagella per cell . 
Swarming panels were similarly examined , except that the percentage of highly ﬂagellated cells was also subjectively evaluated . 
Shearing and time-to-motility experiments . 
For the shearing experiment shown in Fig. 5 below , each overnight culture was diluted 1:200 in 25 ml of LB in a 125-ml ﬂask . 
Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 140 min unti an optical density at 600 nm ( OD600 ) of about 0.6 was reached . 
Each culture was placed on ice , poured into a centrifuge tube , and centrifuged for 10 min at 270 g , and the supernatants were poured off . 
To minimize foaming during blending , the pellets were resuspended in 10 ml cold saline by gentle swirling . 
Each culture was poured into a 25-ml blending cup and blended for 30 s using a Waring blender . 
A 0.75-ml aliquot of blended culture was added to 1.5 ml of LB in a test tube and incubated at 37 °C with shaking . 
At each time point , culture was added to a slide and immediately examined under phase contrast using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Mot plus microscope . 
Five-second-long movies for three different locations on the slide were taken at each time point . 
Three independent cultures were blended for each strain . 
For the time-to-motility experiment shown in Fig. 7B below , overnight cultures were diluted 1:200 in 2 ml of LB in a test tube and incubated at 37 °C with shaking . 
At 90 min , 200 l of 165 g/ml tetracycline in LB was added to induce the tetA promoter controlling the ﬂhDC genes . 
At each time point , 5-s movies were taken at two or three different locations on the slide . 
Three independent cultures were induced for each strain . 
All the cells present on the ﬁrst frame of a 5-s movie were analyzed . 
Cells that made at least one 360 ° rotation during the movie were considered to be tumblers . 
Cells that made signiﬁcant forward progress were subjectively identiﬁed as swimmers . 
Some cells near the edges of the frame were not counted if they drifted or moved out of view before the type of motility could be determined . 
For each time point , the motilities of between 58 and 138 cells were determined . 
An average of 97 cells were counted at each time point . 
- Galactosidase assays . 
- Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously ( 39 ) except that the cells for the experiments shown below in Fig. 3 and 6 were grown to a density of 70 Klett units , which corresponds to an OD600 of about 0.7 . 
For the experiments summarized below in Fig. 7A and 8 and Table 2 , overnight cultures were diluted in 30 ml of LB in 125-ml ﬂasks to an OD600 of 0.01 . 
The cultures were incubated at 37 °C with shaking . 
Samples ( 1 ml ) were removed periodically to follow the growth of the cultures with a spectrophotom-eter , and samples of culture ( between 0.25 ml and 10 ml ) were put on ice for the - galactosidase assays . 
Prewarmed LB or LB-tetracycline was added back to the cultures to maintain at least a 15-ml volume . 
The tetracycline-inducible promoter included in the experiment shown below in Fig. 7A was induced after 80 min of growth with 5 ml of 84 g/ml tetracycline . 
For the experiment shown below in Fig. 3 , class 2 transcription was assayed in the presence of a chlortetracycline inducer in a TH8927-type background that expresses FlhD4C2 from a tetracy-cline-dependent promoter and 28 ( FliA ) from the wild-type arabinose promoter . 
Class 3 transcription was assayed in the presence of an arabinose inducer in a TH13991-type background . 
TH13991 differs from TH8927 in that it also contains a mutated arabinose promoter ( Para935 ) , which lowers class 3 transcription to near-wild-type levels ( 38 ) . 
For the experiment shown below in Fig. 8B , average new LacZ synthesis was calculated for each sampling period according to the following equation : [ ending activity ( starting activity/fold change in OD600 ) ] / elapsed time .

a Strains for which no reference or source is reported were constructed for this study . 
FIG. 2 . 
mRNA levels of ﬂagellar genes were determined using quantitative RT-PCR . 
RNA was extracted from three independent cultures for each promoter mutant , and the mRNA levels of each gene were normalized to the mRNA levels in the wild-type background . 
The mRNA levels for different genes in the same operon were averaged to give the overall transcript levels for those genes . 
For the motA and motB genes , however , only one RT-PCR was performed in which one primer was in motA and one primer was in motB . 
For the genes measured , ﬂhC is expressed from the class 1 promoter , ﬂiAZ , ﬂgMN , ﬂiDST , and ﬂgKL are expressed from both class 2 and class 3 promoters , and motAB is expressed from a class 3 promoter . 
RESULTS
Construction of promoter mutants . 
Four operons in Salmo-nella ( ﬂiAZY , ﬂgMN , ﬂiDST , and ﬂgKL ) are transcribed from both class 2 and class 3 promoters ( Fig. 1 ) ( 13 , 14 ) . 
To explore the purposes for expressing these operons from both promoter classes , mutations were introduced into these promoter regions to greatly reduce either class 2 or class 3 transcription . 
Since the class 2 and class 3 promoters are overlapping in the ﬂiAZY and ﬂiDST operons , point mutations were used to selectively knock out each promoter . 
The point mutations introduced into the promoters were chosen based upon an earlier mutagenesis study ( 38 ) . 
The mutations that were used are located in the conserved 10 and 35 promoter regions or are located in or near the FlhDC binding sites . 
Typically , several mutations had to be combined to reduce promoter activity to less than 3 % of the wild-type level . 
For the ﬂgMN and ﬂgKL operons , the class 2 promoter is one or more genes upstream of the class 3 promoter ( Fig. 1 ) . 
To prevent transcription of these genes from the class 2 promoters , rRNA transcriptional terminators were inserted upstream of each class 3 promoter . 
These terminators block transcription of ﬂgMN and ﬂgKL from the class 2 promoters while leaving transcription of the upstream genes intact ( ﬂgA and ﬂgB to ﬂgJ , respectively ) . 
The class 3 promoters for the ﬂgMN and ﬂgKL operons were separately mutagenized using point mutations . 
In the case of the ﬂiDST class 3 promoter , four positions in the 10 region were randomized , and mutants were screened for low class 3 transcription and wild-type class 2 transcription . 
This approach was taken because all of the ﬂiDST class 3 promoter is overlapped by the class 2 promoter or its mRNA , which made it difﬁcult to isolate mutations that only affected class 3 transcription . 
To assay class 2 transcription independent of class 3 transcription , a strain that expresses ﬂhDC from a tetracycline-inducible promoter and ﬂiA ( 28 ) from an arabinose-inducible promoter was used ( 38 ) . 
When this strain is grown in the presence of tetracycline , ﬂhDC is transcribed and only class 2 promoters are activated . 
When the strain is grown in medium containing arabinose , ﬂiA ( 28 ) is transcribed and only class 3 promoters are activated . 
Insertions of lac fusions in the ﬁrst or second gene of an operon were used to quantify any changes in transcription . 
The introduced mutations and transcriptional terminators reduced transcription by at least 20-fold . 
The activities of the nonmutated promoters remained near the wildtype level . 
mRNA levels in the promoter mutants . 
Quantitative RTPCR was used to determine the overall levels of mRNA transcripts ( class 2 and class 3 transcripts combined ) for the oper ons with mutated promoters ( Fig. 2 ) . 
The ﬂiAZY class 2 promoter mutation knocked down ﬂiAZ transcript levels to 0.5 % of the wild-type level ( Fig. 2A ) , which was a much larger decrease than observed for any of the other mutants . 
This dramatic reduction is likely due to the loss of class 3 transcription . 
Without the ﬂiAZY class 2 promoter , no 28 ( FliA ) would be expressed from the ﬂiAZY operon and no class 3 promoters would then be transcribed . 
With no class 2 transcription of ﬂiAZY due to the mutation and no class 3 transcription due to the lack of 28 , the mRNA levels were accordingly very low . 
In the ﬂiAZY class 2 promoter mutant , the mRNA levels of all other operons expressed from class 2 or class 3 promoters were also decreased , which is probably due to the reduction in both 28 and the class 2 transcriptional activator FliZ ( Fig. 2A ) . 
Surprisingly , mutating the class 3 promoter for the ﬂiAZY operon had no effect on ﬂiAZ mRNA levels ( Fig. 2A ) . 
It had been proposed that the 28 produced from the ﬂiAZY operon would feed back through the ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter to increase ﬂiAZY mRNA levels ( 18 ) . 
In both of the ﬂgMN promoter mutants , mRNA levels of the ﬂgMN genes were reduced to about a quarter of the wild-type level ( Fig. 2A ) . 
This suggests that both promoters contribute signiﬁcantly to the overall ﬂgMN transcript level . 
For the ﬂiDST and ﬂgKL operons , which express the genes for the hook-associated proteins , the class 3 promoter contributed most of the activity for each operon ( Fig. 2B ) . 
Transcripts for these two operons were reduced much more in the class 3 promoter mutants ( 71 % and 79 % decreases ) than in the class 2 promoter mutants ( 22 % increase and 34 % decrease ) . 
Finally , the ﬂgKL class 3 promoter mutation not only decreased ﬂgKL transcripts by 79 % but also reduced ﬂgMN transcripts by 65 % ( Fig. 2B ) . 
FlgK and FlgL may be affecting ﬂgMN transcript levels through FlgN , which is the secretion chaperone for FlgK and FlgL . 
In a previous study , FlgN was found to increase FlgM expression posttranscriptionally ( 17 ) . 
If lower FlgKL levels in the ﬂgKL class 3 promoter mutant decreased FlgN stability , less FlgN could then result in the fewer observed ﬂgMN transcripts . 
Effects of promoter mutations on swimming , swarming , and ﬂagellation . 
Each promoter mutant was checked for defects in two types of motility : swimming through liquids and swarming across surfaces . 
In the swimming assay , bacteria are poked with a toothpick into a 0.3 % agar plate . 
As the bacteria grow and divide , individual cells swim away from the poke through liquid channels in pursuit of additional nutrients . 
In swarming plates with 0.6 % agar , there are not enough liquid channels for the Salmonella cells to swim through , but there is enough moisture to swarm across the surface . 
Swarming cells have more ﬂagella per cell and secrete wetting agents to increase the hydration on the surface . 
Swarming cells stay in close contact with each other and move rapidly past each other in random directions to expand the edge of the swarm ( 11 , 36 ) . 
The ﬂagella on swimming and swarming cells were ﬂuorescently labeled to look for changes in ﬂagellation . 
The wild-type strain typically had about six ﬂagella on a swimming cell ( Fig. 3 ) . 
In contrast , swarming cells were less evenly ﬂagellated . 
About 40 % of swarmer cells were highly ﬂagellated , with an average of nine ﬂagella per cell . 
The number of ﬂagella on the remaining 60 % of cells typically varied from zero to a few per cell . 
Not surprisingly , the ﬂiAZY class 2 promoter mutant was most defective for motility ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Because the class 2 promoter was not present to transcribe ﬂiA in the mutant , no FliA ( 28 ) would have been available to initiate transcription from the class 3 promoters . 
The cells for the ﬂiAZY class 2 promoter mutant lacked ﬂagella . 
The ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter mutant , in contrast , was indistinguishable from the wild-type strain for swimming , swarming , and ﬂagellation , which is consistent with the wild-type mRNA levels observed earlier ( Fig. 2A ) . 
The ﬂgMN class 2 promoter mutant , the ﬂgMN class 3 promoter mutant , and the ﬂiDST class 2 promoter mutant all had slightly larger ( 20 % ) swimming diameters than the wild-type strain but had wild-type ﬂagellation ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Both operons contain negative regulators of ﬂagellar transcription ( FlgM and FliT ) . 
Smaller amounts of these regulators could result in more ﬂagellar components that could slightly improve swimming motility . 
During swarming , the ﬂgMN promoter mutants had a larger proportion of highly ﬂagellated cells . 
About two-thirds of the ﬂgMN mutant swarming cells were highly ﬂagellated in comparison with about 40 % of the wild-type swarming cells . 
This increased ﬂagellation did not translate into a more rapid spread over the swarming plates , however . 
In fact , the ﬂgMN class 2 promoter mutant swarmed 31 % less than the wild-type strain . 
As described later , this reduced swarming ability may result from slower ﬂagellar assembly . 
The ﬂiDST and ﬂgKL class 3 promoter mutants exhibited close to wild-type swimming diameters and a 53 % and 29 % decrease in swarming distance , respectively ( Fig. 3 ) . 
The ﬂiDST class 3 promoter mutant had two-thirds the wild-type number of ﬂagella on both swimming and swarming cells , whereas the ﬂgKL class 3 promoter mutant had a wild-type level of ﬂagellation . 
These two operons express the genes for the HAPs ( FliD , FlgK , and FlgL ) that assemble at the end of the hook before the ﬁlament subunits are added to the structure . 
This seems to be a class 3-speciﬁc effect , since the ﬂiDST and ﬂgKL class 2 promoter mutants were not defective in swarming or ﬂagellation and exhibited near-wild-type swimming diameters . 
These data are consistent with the much larger decrease in mRNA levels in the class 3 promoter mutants ( Fig. 2B ) . 
This pattern was more pronounced when double mutants were constructed . 
When the ﬂiDST and ﬂgKL class 3 promoter mutations were combined into a single strain , the result was a nearly wild-type swimming diameter , a further defect in swarming motility , and about two-thirds the wild-type number of ﬂagella in both swimming and swarming cells . 
In contrast , a class 2 ﬂiDST ﬂgKL double mutant looked like the wild-type strain for swimming and swarming motility . 
Like the ﬂgMN mutants , the class 2 ﬂiDST ﬂgKL double mutant also had about two-thirds of swarming cells highly ﬂagellated . 
Complementation of the ﬂiDST class 3 promoter mutant . 
Complementation was used to determine which gene in the ﬂiDST operon was responsible for the defect in swarming mo-tility . 
Each of the three genes in the operon were individually placed under the control of the arabinose promoter at the ara locus . 
The cloned genes were able to complement deletions of ﬂiD , ﬂiS , or ﬂiT in swimming plates ( data not shown ) . 
These alleles were tested for their ability to complement the swarming defect of the ﬂiDST class 3 promoter mutant ( Fig. 4 ) . 
Higher expression of the ﬁlament cap gene ﬂiD restored the wild-type swarming diameter . 
Swarming motility was not signiﬁcantly increased when the ﬂiS gene , which encodes th chaperone for the ﬁlament subunits , was overexpressed . 
Finally , overexpressed FliT further inhibited motility . 
FliT is a negative regulator for class 2 transcription and is the secretion chaperone for the ﬁlament cap protein FliD ( 7 , 23 , 40 ) . 
The ability of FliD to restore a wild-type swarming diameter is consistent with the swarming defect observed for the ﬂgKL class 3 promoter mutant . 
FliD , FlgK , and FlgL are all HAPs that assemble at the end of the hook and are needed for efﬁcient polymerization of the ﬁlament subunits . 
However , FliD could also increase swarming by binding to FliT to prevent FliT from inhibiting class 2 transcription . 
To separate FliD 's structural role as a HAP from its ability to bind FliT complementation was performed in the absence of FliT ( Fig. 4 ) . 
By itself , a ﬂiT deletion increased the swarming diameter of the ﬂiDST class 3 promoter mutant . 
This suggests that the increased numbers of ﬂagella in a ﬂiT mutant ( 41 ) promote swarming . 
However , complementation with FliD still restored the wild-type swarming diameter in the absence of FliT . 
These complementation data support the hypothesis that higher levels of HAPs are needed during swarming . 
Recovery of motility after ﬂagellar shearing . 
The need for more HAPs during swarming could reﬂect an increased need to repair broken ﬂagella . 
Greater tension on the ﬂagella during swarming has been found to result in increased breakage ( 3 ) . 
Because swarming cells are in close contact with a surface and with each other , there may be more opportunities for a ﬂagellum to stick or get tangled and then break off . 
If this breakage occurs after the hook , a ﬂagellum could potentially be repaired by reassembly of the needed HAPs and then repolymerization of the ﬁlament ( 12 , 30 ) . 
Twofold increases in the mRNA levels of ﬂiD and the ﬁlament subunit genes were observed in swarming cells ( 35 ) and may occur to promote this ﬁlament repair . 
To see if class 3 expression of the HAPs is needed for ﬂagellar repair , strains were tested for their ability to recover motility after their ﬂagella were sheared off in a blender . 
The blender has previously been used as a nonlethal means for breaking off ﬂagella ( 30 , 33 ) . 
The proportion of swimming bacteria was then quantiﬁed from movies taken of the cells by phase-contrast microscopy ( Fig. 5 ) . 
Immediately after shearing , 96 % of the cells were nonmotile , 4 % were slowly tumbling , and no cells were swimming . 
The proportion of swimming cells steadily increased over the next 30 min for the wild-type strain and the class 2 ﬂiDST ﬂgKL double mutant . 
The recovery of the class 3 ﬂiDST ﬂgKL double mutant appeared to lag behind the wild-type strain by about 5 min and had signiﬁcantly fewer swimming cells at the 10-min time point ( P 2 10 7 ; all reported P values are two-tailed ) . 
This 5-min delay in recovery indicates a possible deﬁciency in ﬂagellar repair and could signiﬁcantly impair motility if ﬂagella are repeatedly broken during swarming . 
However , such a short delay could also result from the lower level of ﬂagellation of the class 3 double mutant . 
Fewer ﬂagella to repair could delay the time when enough ﬂagella are long enough for swimming . 
FIG. 3 . 
Promoter activity , mRNA levels , swimming , swarming , and ﬂagellation were characterized for each promoter mutant . 
The positions of point mutations are given in relation to the distance from the start codon . 
Promoter activity was measured in backgrounds that express only class 2 transcription ( TH8927 ) or class 3 transcription ( TH13991 ) . 
The activity from each class 2 promoter or class 3 promoter was quantiﬁed using lac fusions to ﬂiZ , ﬂgM , ﬂiS , or ﬂgK and normalized to the activity of the wild-type promoter . 
Standard deviations were on average 9 % of the promoter activities . 
Total mRNA levels for each mutant were taken from Fig. 2 and determined using quantitative RT-PCR in an otherwise-wild-type background . 
Pictures of representative swimming and swarming plates are shown . 
The wild-type strain spread over 69 % of the swarming plate at 9 h after inoculation and moved through 32 % of the swimming plate at 6 h after inoculation . 
In order to facilitate comparisons , the pictures were resized so that the swimming and swarming diameters of the wild-type strain were equal to each other . 
Pictures of ﬂagella were taken for the mutants in a background ( TH5861 ) that is phase locked for one of the two ﬂagellin genes ( ﬂiC ) in S. Typhimurium . 
Representative ﬂagellated cells are shown . 
The cell membranes are in red and were labeled with FM4-64 . 
Flagella are green and were labeled with antiﬂagellin antibody and secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 .

Effects of ﬂgMN and ﬂiAZY promoter mutations on class 3 transcription . 
Because FlgM helps control the level of class 3 transcription by binding to and inhibiting 28 , the ﬂgMN promoter mutants were checked for their ability to inhibit class 3 transcription . 
The motA class 3 promoter fused to a lac transcriptional fusion was used to quantify class 3 transcription levels . 
In both the class 2 and class 3 ﬂgMN promoter mutants , there was about a 46 % increase in class 3 transcription ( Fig. 6A ) . 
These increases in class 3 transcription were not as high as in a ﬂgM deletion strain , which indicates that both ﬂgMN promoters contribute to the inhibition of 28 . 
In a ﬂgHI background , which lacks the periplasmic and outer membrane rings needed for completion of the HBBs , the motA class 3 promoter was shut off ( Fig. 6A ) . 
This inhibition of class 3 transcription occurs because the HBBs do not change secretion speciﬁcity to ﬁlament-type substrates like FlgM until HBBs are completed . 
Without FlgM secretion , intracellular FlgM levels rise and prevent 28 from initiating transcription at class 3 promoters ( 12 , 20 ) . 
The class 3 ﬂgMN promoter mutant maintained this inhibition in the ﬂgHI background , but the class 2 ﬂgMN promoter mutant exhibited high levels of class 3 transcription ( Fig. 6A ) . 
Apparently , not enough FlgM is produced from the class 3 ﬂgMN promoter to tightly control class 3 transcription before completion of the HBBs . 
These results are consistent with other studies identifying FlgM expressed from the class 2 promoter as responsible for inhibition before completion of the HBBs ( 10 , 17 ) . 
To determine the role of the ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter in controlling class 3 transcription , the ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter mutations were introduced into the backgrounds tested in Fig. 6A . 
The same pattern of class 3 transcriptional activity was observed with or without the ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter mutation ( Fig. 6B ) , which suggests that the ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter is not involved in regulating class 3 transcription levels . 
FliA expressed from the class 2 promoter and FlgM expressed from the class 2 and class 3 promoters appear to be sufﬁcient to control class 3 transcription levels . 
Class 3 transcription after induction of ﬂhDC . 
To further deﬁne the roles of the ﬂgMN promoters and the ﬂiAZY class promoter , class 3 transcription was followed after induction of the ﬂhDC operon . 
The ﬂhDC genes are at the top of the ﬂagellar transcriptional hierarchy and encode the activator of class 2 promoters . 
The ﬂhDC operon was placed under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter ( 18 ) in order to synchronize induction of the ﬂagellar regulon . 
A highly expressed transcriptional fusion to the ﬂjB class 3 promoter was used to determine at what point class 3 transcription was turned on in wild-type and mutant backgrounds ( Fig. 7A ) . 
As had been seen in the earlier study ( 18 ) , class 3 transcription in the wild-type background turned on at about 30 min . 
In the ﬂgMN class 2 promoter mutant , class 3 transcription turned on 15 min earlier . 
In contrast , class 3 transcription in the ﬂgMN class 3 promoter mutant turned on at the same time as the wild-type strain but reached signiﬁcantly higher levels than in the wild-type strain much later , at 90 min ( P 0.06 ) and 150 min ( P 0.009 ) after induction . 
These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the ﬂgMN class 2 promoter is needed to control class 3 transcription before completion of the HBBs , and the ﬂgMN class 3 promoter is needed after completion of the HBBs . 
In a separate experiment , the proportion of swimming cells was followed after induction of the ﬂhDC operon ( Fig. 7B ) . 
Nearly half of the cells for the wild-type strain were swimming by 50 min after ﬂhDC induction , which was consistent with the results of the earlier study ( 18 ) . 
The ﬂgMN class 2 promoter mutant had signiﬁcantly fewer swimming cells than the wildtype strain at 50 min ( P 4 10 6 ) and 60 min ( P 0.05 ) . 
This less-than-10-min delay in swimming motility is short but potentially signiﬁcant . 
The tens of thousands of ﬁlament subunits expressed prematurely may slow construction of the HBBs by competing with HBB subunits for interaction with the secretion system . 
This delay in assembly may have contributed to the defect in swarming observed earlier for the ﬂgMN class 2 promoter mutant ( Fig. 3 ) . 
Class 3 transcription was also followed in strains that had the class 1 promoter intact ( Fig. 8A ) . 
In this wild-type background , class 3 transcription is turned on when the cells begin to grow exponentially and is shut off in stationary phase , as seen previously ( 4 ) . 
Because LacZ is a stable reporter protein , average new synthesis of LacZ was calculated and plotted for each sampling interval ( Fig. 8B ) . 
Class 3 transcription in both ﬂgMN promoter mutants turned on to a higher level and probably earlier than in the wild-type background . 
Class 3 transcription may turn on earlier in the ﬂgMN class 3 promoter mutant because the cells have preexisting ﬂagella in addition to the HBBs being newly synthesized . 
When the cultures entered stationary phase , class 3 transcription was 165 % higher in the ﬂgMN class 3 promoter mutant than in the wild-type strain ( Fig. 8A ) . 
Presumably , secretion of FlgM through completed HBBs would make class 3 expression of FlgM even more important in stationary phase . 
Finally , there was a 34 % increase in class 3 transcription in the ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter mutant in stationary phase . 
This is a counterintuitive result in that by removing a promoter for ﬂiA ( 28 ) , there should be less 28 produced and less class 3 transcription . 
However , a higher level of class 3 transcription was observed here . 
The ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter helps inhibit class 3 transcription . 
Transcriptional fusions to the ﬂiZ and motA genes were utilized to investigate the phenomenon of higher class 3 transcription levels in the ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter mutant . 
In Table 2 , it can be seen that the ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter mutant exhibited a 41 % decrease in ﬂiAZ transcription in stationary phase but not in exponential phase . 
This makes sense in that removing a promoter for ﬂiA should decrease its transcription . 
Less ﬂiA transcription should then result in less 28 and less class 3 transcription . 
Instead , a 37 % increase in class 3 transcription was observed from a transcriptional fusion to the motA class 3 promoter ( Table 2 ) . 
To determine whether the increase was due to FlgM or FliZ , the ﬂgMN promoter mutations and a ﬂiZ deletion were moved into these backgrounds . 
The ﬂgMN class 2 promoter mutation and a ﬂiZ deletion did not signiﬁcantly alter the class 3 transcription ratio when they were introduced . 
When the ﬂgMN class 3 promoter mutation was moved in , the 37 % increase in transcription disappeared . 
These data suggest that higher 28 levels act through FlgM 's class 3 promoter to decrease transcription of motA in stationary phase . 
Higher levels of FlgM produced from a class 3 promoter during exponential growth may persist into stationary phase to more quickly shut off overall class 3 transcription . 
FIG. 4 . 
FliD , FliS , and FliT were tested for their abilities to complement the ﬂiDST class 3 promoter mutant in swarming plates containing arabinose . 
In the control strain , the arabinose genes that are normally expressed from the arabinose promoter were replaced by the tetRA cassette , which provided tetracycline resistance . 
FIG. 5 . 
The percentage of swimming cells was followed after ﬂa-gella were sheared off in a blender . 
The cultures for the no-shearing control were put on ice , centrifuged , and resuspended in cold saline , i.e. , the same as for the cultures that were blended . 
FIG. 6 . 
The level of transcription from the motA class 3 promoter was quantiﬁed in ﬂgMN and ﬂiAZY promoter mutant backgrounds . 
The activities from a lac reporter fused to the motA class 3 promoter were measured at an OD600 of about 0.7 and are expressed in units of nmol/min/OD650 / ml . 
The ﬂgHI allele prevents secretion of FlgM because FlgH and FlgI are needed for completion of HBBs .

DISCUSSION
This study explored the purposes for expressing four ﬂagellar operons from both class 2 and class 3 promoters . 
As expected , the class 2 promoter for the ﬂiAZY operon was needed to express FliA ( 28 ) so that class 3 promoters could be activated . 
Contrary to expectations , the class 3 promoter for the ﬂiAZY operon was found to lower class 3 transcription in stationary phase . 
Both ﬂgMN promoters were involved in controlling class 3 transcription levels ( Fig. 9A ) . 
The ﬂgMN class 2 promoter was needed to shut off class 3 transcription before completion of the HBBs , and the ﬂgMN class 3 promoter inhibited class 3 transcription after completion of the HBBs . 
The expression of the HAPs ( FliD , FlgK , and FlgL ) from class 3 promoters was important for swarming motility ( Fig. 9B ) . 
Finally , mutating the class 2 promoters for the ﬂgKL and ﬂiDST operons had no effect on swimming or swarming mo-tility . 
These mutants have provided insights into the functions a - Galactosidase activities ( means standard deviations ) are in units of nmol/min/OD650 / ml . 
b The ratio ﬂiAZY P3 activity to wild-type activity . 
c ﬂiZ : : MudJ was inserted 10 bp after the stop codon of ﬂiZ of some of the promoters , but much further characterization is needed . 
The most surprising result of this study was the involvement of the ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter in inhibiting class 3 transcription . 
By stationary phase , the ﬂiAZY class 3 promoter accounted for 41 % of ﬂiAZY transcription ( Table 2 ) . 
Transcription of the ﬂiAZY operon from the class 3 promoter should lead to higher levels of 28 and higher levels of class 3 transcription . 
However , a 27 % decrease in class 3 motA transcription was observed ( Table 2 ) . 
One possible explanation is that the class 3 promoters for 28 and FlgM result in larger pools of both regulators during exponential growth . 
Overall , class 3 transcription may not increase during exponential growth be-28 cause the higher levels of would be balanced by higher levels of FlgM . 
If FlgM is then more stably maintained into stationary phase than 28 , the higher FlgM levels could more effectively shut off class 3 promoters . 
The characterization of the ﬂgMN promoter mutants further supports the idea that FlgM coordinates ﬂagellar transcription with assembly ( 12 , 20 ) . 
The advantage to this coordination had not been determined , however . 
One hypothesis is that coordination enables HBB components to be synthesized , secreted , and assembled without competition from tens of thousands of ﬁlament subunits ( 12 ) . 
The ﬂgMN class 2 promoter mutant provided some support for this hypothesis since the mutant was slower to become motile after induction of the ﬂagellar regulon ( Fig. 7B ) . 
The ﬂgMN class 3 promoter mutant , on the other hand , did not exhibit any defects in motility . 
The advantage to having a class 3 ﬂgMN promoter could be to prevent extra subunits from being synthesized when class 3 transcription levels are high . 
More efﬁcient use of resources may not affect motility but may be particularly important during stationary phase . 
This efﬁciency argument could explain why the class 2 promoter mutants for operons expressing the HAPs had little effect on motility or mRNA levels . 
A little class 2 expression of the HAPs could give the HAPs time to assemble before the ﬁlament subunits are produced ( 17 , 21 ) . 
Without assembly of the HAPs , ﬁlament subunits are secreted into the extracellular medium because they are unable to polymerize . 
It is noteworthy that the RT-PCR assays showed about equal levels of ﬂgMN transcription when either the class 2 or class 3 ﬂgMN promoter was mutated . 
FlgM is an autoregulatory protein . 
Loss of FlgM results in the derepression of both class 2 and class 3 ﬂgMN promoters ( 10 , 22 ) . 
Previous work utilizing a ﬂgM : : Mud-lac reporter fusion to investigate the effects dem-onstrated an 80 % reduction in PﬂgMN transcription when class 3 ﬂgMN transcription was inhibited and only a 20 % reduction when class 2 ﬂgMN transcription was inhibited ( 10 ) . 
Since the Mud-lac insertion also disrupted the ﬂgM gene , this had the added beneﬁt of removing FlgM autoregulation from the ﬁnal result . 
Thus , the measurement of ﬂgM transcription from its class 2 and class 3 promoters in the ﬂgM : : Mud-lac background provides a more accurate measurement of actual levels of transcription from its respective promoters than using RTPCR on wild-type cells . 
In summary , our data suggest that there are advantages to expressing ﬂagellar operons from both class 2 and class 3 promoters . 
The swarming data indicate that at least part of this regulation exists to respond to speciﬁc environmental conditions . 
The time-to-motility experiment provides weak evidence that such complex regulation is needed for fast and efﬁcient assembly of ﬂagella . 
Further characterization of the mutants constructed in this study should provide additional insights into the important roles of these ﬂagellar promoters .

The role of ﬂagellar promoters in coordinating class 3 transcription with HBB assembly ( A ) and in repairing broken ﬂagella during swarming ( B ) . 
( A ) While HBBs are being assembled , class 2-expressed FliA ( 28 ) is inhibited by class 2-expressed FlgM . 
After HBBs are completed and FlgM secretion begins , the level of class 3 transcription is maintained by FliA expressed from a class 2 promoter and FlgM expressed from both class 2 and class 3 promoters . 
A dashed arrow is used for class 3 expression of FliA ( 28 ) because of its contradictory effects in both increasing ﬂiA transcription and decreasing class 3 transcription in stationary phase . 
( B ) Expression of FlgKL and FliD from either the class 2 promoters or the class 3 promoters was sufﬁcient to construct ﬂagella for swimming . 
Additional expression of FlgKL , FliD , and ﬂagellin from class 3 promoters could be important for repairing broken ﬂagella during swarming .
