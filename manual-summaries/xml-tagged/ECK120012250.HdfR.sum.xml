Hns-dependent flhDCregulator,  HdfR, negatively regulates  expression of  flagellar master operon, flhDC [10913108] and positively regulates  expression of  gltBD operon [21034467]. H-NS is a direct activator of  flhDC operon and represses transcription of hdfR.
HdfR is a transcriptional regulator that <EVF>belongs to  LysR family</EVF>. <DOM>It consist of two domains, an amino-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a carboxy-terminal domain involved in co-inducer recognition [10913108, 8257110].</DOM> Little is known about  regulatory role of HdfR, and  binding sites for this transcription factor have not yet been determined.
In systematic studies of oligomerization, it was shown that some members of  LysR family, like HdfR, interact with or members of  family to form heterodimers, but  physiological significance of this is unknown [21187915].
