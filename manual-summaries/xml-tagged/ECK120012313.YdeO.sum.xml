YdeO activates genes involved in  <RP>cellular response to acid resistance</RP> [12399493, 12694615, 15489450]. <ACTREG>This protein, toger with  proteins HNS, EvgA, and GadE, pertains to a specific regulatory circuit that is functional in exponential-phase cells growing in minimal medium</ACTREG> [12399493, 12694615, 15489450]. Several of  genes directly regulated by YdeO are also directly regulated by GadX [12694615].
YdeO <EVF>belongs to  AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> and shows more similarity to YhiW, AppY, AdiY, and GadX than  or AraC/XylS regulators [9409145, 17712603]. <DOM> members of this family exhibit two domains, an amino-terminal domain involved in coinducer recognition and dimerization and a carboxy-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif [9409145, 11282467].</DOM>
At this time, nothing is known of YdeO DNA-binding sites.
ydeO <TUL>is transcribed in an operon toger with  gene safA</TUL> [12694615]. This gene codes for a protein that directly interacts with PhoQ to activate  PhoQ/PhoP system, which regulates genes, including Mg2+ transporters and lipopolysaccharide modification genes [17998538].
<TUCREG><ACTCONDP>YdeO expression is induced by UV irradiation via  EvgS/EvgA system</ACTCONDP></TUCREG> and thus controls  expression of 21 genes [22790954].
