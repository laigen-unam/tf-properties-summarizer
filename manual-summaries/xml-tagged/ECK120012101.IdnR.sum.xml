l-idonate regulator,  IdnR, is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in <RP>l-idonate metabolism</RP>, which are organized in two coordinately regulated transcription units [9658018, 14973046]. <ACTREG>This regulator is positively autoregulated and co-regulates with CRP</ACTREG>, a global transcriptional regulator; se regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of an operon related to transport and catabolism of l-idonate [14973046]. Synsis of this operon is induced when Escherichia coli is grown on l-idonate/5KG in  absence of glucose and gluconate. In addition, this regulator represses transcription of genes related to <RP>gluconate metabolism</RP> [9658018].
<ACTCONDP>In  presence of l-idonate, IdnR <SSA>binds to <SSZ>16-nucleotide-long DNA-target sites</SSZ> in  idnK/idnDOTR intergenic region</SSA></ACTCONDP> to coordinately activate transcription of  idnKp and  idnDp [14973046]. 
IdnR <EVPIT>exhibits a high similarity to GntR (53%)</EVPIT> and <EVF>belongs to  LacI/GalR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> [11115104]. <TUL>It is part of  idnDOTR operon</TUL>, yet it can also be transcribed as an independent (idnR) transcription unit [14973046].
