RelB is  antitoxin of  RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system [9767574]. RelB also represses transcription of relBEF [9767574].  RelE toxin <RP>inhibits protein translation by catalyzing cleavage of mRNA in  A site of  ribosome</RP> [12526800]. RelB production relieves established RelE-mediated translation inhibition and inhibition of cell growth, indicating that growth inhibition is not irreversible [12123459].  activity of tmRNA, SsrA, counteracts RelE-mediated translation inhibition [12526800, 12787364].   
RelE-RelB system is involved in regulation of cell growth under conditions with limited nutrients [342488, 6162075, 11717402, 12526800, 12787364]. A Tn10 insertion in ydfV restores colony-forming ability to an rne mutant.  suppression phenotype is reversed by overexpression of relB, but not ydfV [22328678]. 
RelE and RelB exhibit a physical interaction, and RelE physically interacts with ribosomes [11274135].
<ACTREG>Regulation has been described [2990907, 11717402]. When cells are starved of amino acids, Lon protease degrades RelB</ACTREG>; RelB degradation derepresses transcription of relBE; RelE accumulates in excess compared with its RelB antitoxin; and this free RelE causes translation inhibition [11717402].     
Mutations in  relB locus were initially identified by a  delayed relaxed  phenotype [5321960, 326765].
