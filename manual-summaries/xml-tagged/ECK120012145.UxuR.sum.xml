hexuronate regulator,  UxuR, is a transcriptional factor. <ACTREG>This protein negatively regulates its own synsis</ACTREG>, and <ACTCONDP>in  absence of fructuronate it represses transcription of  cluster of operons involved in <RP>transport and degradation of  sugar acids Î²-D-glucuronides, glucuronate, and gluconate</RP></ACTCONDP> [6281232, 7007313, 11115104, 15516583, 3083215]. <ACTCONDN>This regulator is subject to catabolic repression in  presence of glucose and at low levels of cyclic AMP</ACTCONDN>.
Although little is known about  regulating mechanism of UxuR, it has been shown to act as a repressor, <SSA>binding to a putative <SSM>inverted repeat sequence</SSM> from  uid operon in a cooperative process with UidR</SSA> [6353163, 3079718, 2823062]. In 1986, Blanco et al. proposed that total repression of UxuR is achieved in  presence of UidR, suggesting  possibility that UxuR and UidR form a complex. Independently, each repressor binds to DNA separately [3079718, 3889544, 2823062].
 
On  or hand, <EVPIT>UxuR is highly similar to ExuR (49% identity)</EVPIT>, and apparently both act toger, capable of cross talk to regulate expression of  uxuR regulon [11115104].
UxuR is a protein that <EVF>belongs to  GntR family</EVF> and participates as a regulator of several genes involved in carbon uptake.
