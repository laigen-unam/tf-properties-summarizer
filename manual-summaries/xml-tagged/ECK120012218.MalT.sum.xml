Maltose regulator,  MalT, is a transcription factor that activates transcription of several genes and operons involved in <RP>maltose catabolism and transport</RP> [10973069, 1918057, 1544897, 7040340, 7830577]. This regulator is sensitive to catabolite control and <ACTCONDP>is induced when Escherichia coli is grown on maltodextrin in  absence of glucose</ACTCONDP> [6315676, 8952481, 8895588]. MalT is a STAND transcription factor,  Signal Transduction ATP bases with numerous domains [20545845][24134781]. A novel regulatory role for  MalT regulon in <RP>glycolysis-associated utilization of carbon sources</RP> has been identified [21912786]. 
MalT is monomeric in solution, but in  presence of maltodextrin and ATP it forms multiple complexes (oligomers) in its target promoters and activates transcription by overlapping  -35 box of promoters [1544897, 1918057]. <SSA> binding targets of MalT consist of <SSZ>10-nucleotide-long</SSZ> <SSM>direct repeat sequences</SSM> that possess conserved motifs</SSA>; each monomer binds to one of se conserved sequences [1918057].
<TUL> gene malT is located upstream of  operon malPQ</TUL> and in  opposite direction [9529892, 10973069, 11931562]. This transcriptional activator [3015733]<EVF>belongs to  LuxR family of activators</EVF>. <DOM>MalT subunits consist of four domains:  C-terminal DNA-binding domain,  N-terminal ATP-binding domain, and two domains (DT2 and DT3) involved in effector recognition (maltotriose) [15733913, 11209048, 11709169, 8227007, 12003949]. Based on an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach, it was shown that <ACTEFFE> inducer maltotriose</ACTEFFE> binds inside  cavity of  tetratricopeptide-like sensor domain of MalT, a bacterial STAND transcription factor [20545845]. Maltotriose plays a dual role in signal transduction by MalT; it triggers nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) opening and renders  MalT multimeric platform competent for downstream signaling [24134781].</DOM>
<ACTREG>MalT activity is negatively regulated by Aes and MalY through direct protein-protein interactions and competition with maltotriose for MalT binding</ACTREG> [12374803, 11867639, 12003949, 10692154]. se characteristics point toward identical modes of action for MalY and Aes. However,  identification of an amino acid substitution in MalT that suppresses Aes inhibition without interfering with MalY inhibition suggests that  binding sites of  two inhibitory proteins are not  same [11867639, 12003949]. In addition, MalK inhibits maltotriose binding by MalT; interestingly, however, MalK interacts directly with MalT in  absence of maltotriose but not in  presence of maltotriose [15180985, 15733913].
