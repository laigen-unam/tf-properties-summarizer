AlpA is a transcriptional regulator of intA expression [7511582].  It is part of  CP4-57 cryptic prophage that is similar to bacteriophage P4 [7511583].  
alpA was first identified as a multicopy suppressor of lon mutants that leads to  expression of an alternative Lon <RP>protease activity named Alp [2656652, 7511582].  AlpA expression leads to increased synsis of IntA, which results in excision of  CP4-57 cryptic prophage</RP>.   excision inactivates  gene upstream of intA, ssrA, encoding tmRNA [7511583].
Expression of alpA increases 6.5-fold upon deletion of tqsA; alpA expression may thus be involved in biofilm formation [16385049].
CP4-57:  cryptic P4-like prophage at min 57  [7511583].
AlpA:  alternative Lon protease  [2656652].
