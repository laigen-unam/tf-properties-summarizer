transcriptional regulatory protein BasR is part of  two-component BasS/BasR signal transduction system [8282725]. <ACTREG>BasS functions as a membrane-associated protein kinase that phosphorylates BasR <ACTCONDP>in response to elevated levels of Fe(III)</ACTCONDP></ACTREG> which can permeabilize  outer membrane and result in cell death [15522865, 8282725, 12139617]. <ACTCONDP>Phosphorylation of BasR increases  affinity for its specific DNA binding sites</ACTCONDP>, leading to  transcriptional expression of several genes involved in <RP>modification of lipopolysaccharide to prevent excessiveFe(III) binding</RP> [15322361].
Deletion of basR resulted in susceptibility to cell-killing by elevated levels of Fe(III) [12139617]. Deletion of basSR resulted in acid sensitivity during growth at elevated iron concentrations [15322361]. Expression of  arnBCADTEF operon increased during growth with elevated FeSO4 or FeCl3 and was dependent upon  BasSR two-component signal transduction system [15322361]. Deletion of basR prevents  FeSO4-, ZnSO4-, and NH4VO3-mediated induction of eptA, arnB, and yibD and results in sensitivity to  cationic agent polymyxin B [16428424]. A basRG53V (constitutive) mutant is resistant to polymyxin B and colistin, sensitive to  anionic agent deoxycholic acid, and expresses eptA, arnB, and yibD at high levels [16428424]. Activation of  BasSR two-component system by Fe3+ results in  post-translational inhibition of |FRAME: G7146-MONOMER  LpxT | and a near total loss of 1-diphosphate lipid A from  cell surface [20384697]. Zn2+ inhibits growth of a basR mutant slightly [15659689].  antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin B, binds to BasR and inhibits its phosphorylation in vitro [22138548].
