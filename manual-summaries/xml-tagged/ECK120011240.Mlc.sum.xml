DgsA, better known as Mlc,  makes large colonies,  [7766024]is a transcriptional dual regulator that controls  expression of a number of genes encoding enzymes of  Escherichia coli <RP>phosphotransferase (PTS) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) systems [11934616, 16519088]. It also regulates genes involved in  uptake of glucose [11139621]. It is considered a global regulator of carbohydrate metabolism</RP> [9484893, 9781886]. In addition, Mlc regulates expression of  MalT transcriptional regulator,  activator of  maltose regulon [9484893]. 
<ACTCONDN>Mlc repressor function is disabled by binding of Mlc to an actively-transported and dephosphorylated form of PtsG </ACTCONDN>(EIICBGlc) [11032803, 11157755].  membrane-bound part of EIICBGlc is essential for Mlc inactivation [11157755, 12529317].  Analysis of  crystal structures of  tetrameric Mlc/EIIB complex shows a molecular mechanism of Mlc inactivation by membrane sequestration, in which Mlc loss its DNA binding ability in vivo due to  conformational obstruction by EIIB molecules [18319344].
 crystal structure of Mlc has been determined [16510988, 15929984] to 2.85 and 2.7 Å resolution and Mlc in complex with four molecules of enzyme IIBGlc (EIIB) [18319344] to 2.85 Å resolution. Mlc forms stable dimers and binds to <SSM>palindromic operator sites</SSM>. <DOM> N-terminal region has a helix-turn-helix domain, and a C-terminal helix is implicated in EIICBGlc binding [12529317]. Mlc forms tetramers in solution [16510988, 12529317, 11157755].  Mlc monomer is composed of three domains: a DNA-binding motif (D-domain), an EIICBGlc-binding motif (E-domain), and an oligomerization domain (O-domain) [18319344].</DOM>
<ACTREG>Mlc is autoregulated</ACTREG> [9484893, 11340070] but <ACTREG>it is also repressed and activated by CRP</ACTREG> [11340070]. <SSA>Mlc binds to sites with a <SSZ>length of 23 bp</SSZ></SSA>. Its consensus sequence has been determined [11139621].
 intracellular concentration of Mlc is very limited [11157755]. Zinc mediates  Mlc repressor function [15929984]. <EVPIT>Mlc has a high homology with  NagC transcriptional dual regulator (40% identity and 80% similarity) [7766024, 15916829]</EVPIT>. At  post-transcriptional level, Mlc interacts with MtfA, which is involved in  regulation of  ptsG [16855233].
Mlc is a <EVF>member of  ROK (repressor, ORFs, kinases) (NagC/XylR) family of proteins</EVF>, which contains at least two distinct classes of proteins: xylose repressor (XylR) and a series of glucose/fructose kinases [7952186, 12374829].
