sn-Glycerol-3-phosphate repressor, GlpR, acts as  repressor of <RP> glycerol-3-phosphate regulon</RP>, which is organized in different operons [3316209, 825019, 1556120, 9179845, 1400248, 1372899, 8955388]. <TUL>This regulator is part of  glpEGR operon, yet it can also be constitutively expressed as an independent ARRAY(0x1577a08) transcription unit</TUL> [9524241, 3881401]. In addition,  operons regulated are induced when Escherichia coli is grown in  presence of inductor, glycerol, or glycerol-3-phosphate ARRAY(0x15b6280) , and  absence of glucose [825019]. 
<ACTCONDP>In  absence of inductor, this repressor binds in tandem to <SSA><SSM>inverted repeat sequences</SSM> that consist of <SSZ>20-nucleotide-long DNA target sites</SSZ></SSA></ACTCONDP> [8157609, 1556120, 825019]. 
<ACTCONDN>Binding of GlpR to DNA is diminished in  presence of  inducers glycerol or G3P</ACTCONDN>. GlpR <EVF>belongs to  DeoR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> [8955387]. Accordingly, <DOM>this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: a conserved N-terminal domain which contains  DNA-binding region, and  carboxy-terminal domain, which is involved in oligomerization and binding of  inducer [8955387]. </DOM>
Resequencing of multiple isolates of  MG1655 strain has identified several genetic variations compared to  reference sequence, including a 1-bp deletion in glpR in strain ATCC700926 [22081388].  summarizes se sequence differences.
