SugaR transport-related Regulator  SgrR <TUR><ACTREG>is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG></TUR> and coordinately activates transcription of  divergent operon. This regulator coordinates <RP> response to glucose-phosphate stress</RP> [17209026, 15522088, 17383224]. <ACTCONDP>As  intracellular accumulation of <ACTEFFE>glucose-6-phosphate</ACTEFFE> correlates with SgrR induction</ACTCONDP>, it has been proposed as its inducer [17209026, 15522088, 17383224]. <ACTREG>Autoregulation of SgrR is not affected by phosphosugar stress</ACTREG> [17209026]. In addition,  induction of sgrS expression by  nonmetabolizable glucose PTS substrate (+/-)-methyl glucoside is abolished in a sgrR mutant [15522088].
 SgrR protein is a <EVF>member of a novel family of regulators</EVF> and <DOM>contains an N terminal which is characteristic of winged-helix DNA-binding transcriptional regulators and a predicted C-terminal solute-binding domain [17209026].</DOM>
