YqjI is a local transcription regulator that represses expression of  divergent operon, yqjH-yqjI, related to its autorepression and  synsis of <RP>an NADPH-dependent ferric reductase </RP>[21097627]. This regulator forms a complex with DNA in  absence of nickel, binding to a <SSA><SSZ>20-bp-long sequence</SSZ> with an <SSM>imperfect palindromic sequence</SSM></SSA>. <ACTCONDN>YqjI is inactivated under conditions of elevated nickel levels</ACTCONDN>, and  presence of this divalent metal prevents its binding to  target gene. Thus, this regulator maintains  iron homeostasis during high levels of nickel [21097627]. However, in vitro studies have shown that YqjI can be affected by or divalent metals.
YqjI regulator is structurally <EVF>related to  PadR family</EVF>, <DOM>which is characterized by a winged helix-turn-helix (WHTH) motif.  amino-terminal region of this protein is similar to  C-terminal SlyD protein and to  N-terminal RcnA protein [21097627]. Comparison with  crystal structure of  AphA protein from Vibrio cholerae suggests that  amino terminal of YqjI contains  WHTH motif and that in  C-terminal domain is located  ligand-binding domain for oligomerization [21097627].</DOM> YqjI has been observed to be a possible hexamer [21097627].
