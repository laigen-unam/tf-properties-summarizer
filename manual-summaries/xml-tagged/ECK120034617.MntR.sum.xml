MntR,  Mn2+ transport regulator ,  primary sensor and transducer of manganese abundance, is a dual regulator that senses manganese and negatively or positively controls  transcription of different genes involved in <RP>manganese homeostasis</RP> [11466284, 21908668].
This protein <EVF>belongs to  DtxR family</EVF>. <DOM> members of this family have three domains: an N-terminal domain with a helix-turn-helix motif, which binds to DNA; a central domain for dimerization and metal ion binding; and a C-terminal alpha-spectrin SH3-like domain. However, MntR lacks  SH3-like domain [11466284].
3D structure of apo-MntR has been solved.  protein dimerizes via its C-terminal domain.  N-terminal and C-terminal domains are connected by a long Î±-helical linker [19701940].  N-terminal domain is expected to bind two manganese ions per monomer, in analogy to BsMntR from B. subtilis, which has been crystallized with and without bound manganese [12847518, 17118401]. All residues involved in manganese binding in BsMntR ar conserved in MntR [19701940]. </DOM>
<ACTREG>MntR does not seem to be autoregulated</ACTREG> [11466284].
Many iron acquisition genes are derepressed in  mntR mutant [21908668].
