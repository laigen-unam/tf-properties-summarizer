PdhR,  pyruvate dehydrogenase complex regulator,  regulates genes involved in <RP> pyruvate dehydrogenase complex</RP> [7783622, 8262214, 10972807]. 
<ACTREG>Activity of PdhR is controlled by pyruvate. <ACTCONDP>In  absence of this compound,  PdhR regulator binds to its target promoters</ACTCONDP></ACTREG>. This repression is antagonized by its coeffector, <ACTEFFE>pyruvate</ACTEFFE> [7783622, 17513468]. In addition to  role described above, PdhR also controls  synsis of two key enzymes (Ndh and CyoA) in  terminal electron transport system [17513468].
 PdhR <EVF>belongs to  GntR family of transcriptional regulatory proteins</EVF>, which <DOM>share sequence similarities in ir N-terminal DNA-binding domains [2060763, 8407843].</DOM> <TUR>PdhR is negatively autoregulated</TUR> [2548486].
<SSA> pdhR consensus sequences has been determined to be <SSZ>17bp</SSZ> [7783622] and more recently as <SSZ>15 bp</SSZ></SSA> [17513468].
