genes that  YeiL transcriptional activator regulates have not been identified yet, but it has been proposed that this protein might regulate genes involved in <RP> post-exponential-phase nitrogen starvation. A gene encoding a potential nucleoside hydrolase</RP> and transcribed divergently from yeiL has also been suggested to be subject to YeiL regulation [11101674].
YeiL, <EVF> third member of  CRP/FNR family</EVF>, <DOM>has  main structural elements conserved in Crp and Fnr, such as a sensory domain, an Î±-helix that serves as a dimer interface, and a DNA-recognition helix also found in Fnr. However,  specific residues in  helix for DNA binding are not conserved [11101674].</DOM>
regulatory activity of this protein has been suggested by analogy with FNR; this activity might be modulated by a sensory iron-sulfur cluster or by reversible disulfide-bond formation. Expression of yeiL increases during stationary phase under aerobic conditions and is positively autoregulated [11101674].
