FabR,  Fatty acid biosynsis Regulator,  represses expression of  fabA and fabB genes, which are essential for  <RP>synsis of monounsaturated fatty acids</RP> [12440970, 11859088]. FabR directly influences membrane lipid homeostasis [12440970, 11859088, 1100043]. It is a unique example of a transcription factor exclusively regulating expression of type II fatty acid synthase enzymes [11859088]. 
FabR <SSA>consensus sequence has been identified as a <SSM>palindromic sequence</SSM> with a <SSZ>length of 18 bp</SSZ></SSA> [11859088, 11160901]. <ACTCONDP>DNA binding and repression require  binding of <ACTEFFE>unsaturated acyl-ACP (acyl-acyl carrier protein) or acyl-CoA</ACTEFFE>.</ACTCONDP> Saturated acyl-ACP or acyl-CoA competes with  unsaturated fatty acids for binding to FabR but does not trigger DNA binding [19854834]. Thus, FabR senses  ratio, rar than  absolute amount, of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids and adjusts expression of fabA and fabB to balance  composition of saturated and unsaturated acyl-ACP [19854834].
binding site for FabR overlaps with  binding site for FadR,  transcriptional activator for fabA and fabB in  promoter regions of both fabA and fabB. Both regulators can bind simultaneously to  promoter of fabB in  presence of unsaturated acyl-ACP [19854834].
FabR <EVF>belongs to  TetR family</EVF> [15944459, 11160901, 10592242] and <DOM>has a helix-turn-helix motif at  N terminus typical of repressors [10734204].</DOM> Homologs of FabR are found exclusively in Î³-protobacteria [11160901].
