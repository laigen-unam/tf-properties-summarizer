antitoxin MqsA belongs to  toxin-antitoxin system MqsR-MqsA, which controls <RP>biofilm formation and triggers programmed cell death</RP> in E. coli [19690171].  mqsR is cotranscribed with  downstream gene mqsA, and ir respective open reading frames are separated by 1 bp. 
toxin MqsR functions as an mRNA interferase, that is, it possesses endoribonuclease activity and cleaves mRNA at  specific sequence GCU, 5' or 3' of  G.  Elevated levels of free MqsR result in programmed cell death due to  degradation of mRNA and concomitant inhibition of protein synsis [19690171].
antitoxin MqsA has two functions. It binds and reby inhibits  endoribonuclease activity of MqsR. In addition it is a DNA-binding protein, as is  case for or bacterial antitoxins.  MqsA recognizes <SSA><SSM>two palindromic sites</SSM> located between  promoter and  start codon of mqsR</SSA>.  Binding to se sites is enhanced when MqsA is bound to MqsR. refore, <TUR>it has been suggested that MqsA and  MqsA-MqsR complex negatively autoregulate expression of  mqsRA operon</TUR> [19690171].
Solution [19636869, 22789559] and crystal structures [20041169, 21068382] of MqsA have been solved.
Both MqsR and MqsA are dimeric proteins. Based on gel filtration experiments and in analogy to or bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems, it has been proposed that  MqsA-MqsR complex consists of one MqsA dimer and two MqsR dimers [19690171].
