YdfH <EVF>belongs to  GntR transcription factor family</EVF> [10734204] for which  consensus sequence is reported to be tnGTnnnACna [11756427].
Although only one site was determined in a gel shift assay, it is possible that YfdH binds as a complex of flanking regions of  core sequence (-65 to -50) [22972332].
YdfH is not a global repressor, and few genes are repressed by YdfH [22972332].
