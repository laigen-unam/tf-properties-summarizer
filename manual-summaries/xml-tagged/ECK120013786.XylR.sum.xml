Xylose regulator,  XylR, is a transcription factor involved in d-xylose degradation. It coregulates with CRP, a global transcriptional regulator [9371449]. se regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of  operons involved in <RP>transport and catabolism of d-xylose</RP>. Synsis of se operons is induced when Escherichia coli is grown on d-xylose in  absence of glucose. <ACTCONDP>Gene induction occurs when  physiological inducer, d-xylose, binds to XylR and when cellular cyclic AMP levels are high</ACTCONDP> [9371449].
<ACTCONDP>In  presence of d-xylose, XylR binds in tandem to four inverted repeat sequences in  xylAB/xylFGHR intergenic region</ACTCONDP> to activate transcription by overlapping  ?35 boxes of xylABp and xylFGHRp [9371449]. <SSA> binding targets for XylR consist of <SSZ>18-nucleotide-long</SSZ> <SSM>directed repeat sequences</SSM> that possess conserved motifs</SSA>; each monomer binds to one of se conserved sequences [9371449, 11750821] <EVF>XylR belongs to  AraC/XylS family</EVF> [9409145, 11752325].
