RstA appears to control genes involved in different biological processes, such as <RP>acid tolerance,  curli fimbria formation, and anaerobic respiration, among ors [17468243]. Some phenotypes caused by RstA have been identified by mutational analysis. For example, RstA is a suppressor of a lesion in yjeE, a gene essential for cell growth and whose cellular function is unknown [17293428]. RstA overproduction causes drug resistance</RP> [12618449, 12951338]. 
RstA belongs to  two-component system RstA/RstB [15522865]. Both genes, <TUCREG><TURO>rstA, encoding  response regulator, and rstB, encoding  sensor kinase, are transcribed toger in an operon</TURO> that is induced under low-Mg2+ growth conditions through  PhoP/PhoQ two-component system</TUCREG> [12813061]. <ACTREG> autophosphorylation of RstB appears to be stimulated by low pH [17468243, 15522865]. Subsequently,  phosphate group is transferred from RstB to RstA to activate it</ACTREG> [15522865].
<SSA>A <SSZ>14-bp DNA sequence</SSZ> that contains  TACA <SSM>direct repeat</SSM></SSA> has been identified as  RstA DNA-binding site and is called  RstA box [17468243].
