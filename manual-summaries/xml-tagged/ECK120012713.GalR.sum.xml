Galactose repressor,  GalR, is a DNA-binding transcription factor that represses transcription of  operons involved in <RP>transport and catabolism of D-galactose</RP> [17630975, 7934815, 8416900, 8982002]. Synsis of se operons is induced when E. coli is grown in  presence of inducer (D-galactose) and  absence glucose [8982002, 7934815, 1619663, 8416900]. <TUCREG> expression of galR is increased only in  presence of inducer</TUCREG> [8416900, 8982002]. 
In particular, <ACTCONDP>in  absence of D-galactose, GalR represses  galETKM operon</ACTCONDP>[9218807]. In this repression system, GalR binds to two operators in  presence of HU, resulting in  formation of a repressor loop [9218807, 12169637, 15289461]. <SSA>This repressor binds in tandem to <SSM>inverted repeat sequences</SSM> that are <SSZ>16 nucleotides long</SSZ> and possess conserved motifs</SSA>; each dimer binds to one of se conserved sequences [7934815, 8416900]. 
On  or hand, <EVPIT>GalR is highly homologous in its amino acid sequence to GalS (55% identical and 88% similar)</EVPIT>; apparently both act toger and are capable of cross-talk to regulate expression of  gal regulon [1619663, 8982002]. For this reason se regulators bind  same operators, in  cis regulatory regions, with different affinities [8175668]. <ACTCONDN>In  presence of inductor, GalR undergoes a conformational change that reduces its affinity for  operator</ACTCONDN>. Golding et al. showed that GalR is  major repressor of  gal operon [1655705].
<EVF>GalR belongs to  GalR/LacI family of transcriptional regulators</EVF>. Accordingly, <DOM>this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: a conserved N-terminal domain which contains  DNA-binding region, and  carboxy-terminal domain, which is involved in effector binding and dimerization [1619663, 8982002]. GalR and GalS have only two substitutions in  first helix of  N-terminal domain [1619663].</DOM>
