CusR,  Cu-sensing regulator ,  regulates genes related to <RP> copper and silver efflux systems</RP> [11004187, 11283292] <ACTCONDP>under anaerobic growth and under extreme copper stress in aerobic growth</ACTCONDP> [11399769]. CusR belongs to  two-component system CusS/CusR, <ACTCONDP>which responds to increases in  copper concentration</ACTCONDP>. Both cusR, encoding  response regulator, and cusS, encoding  sensor kinase, are organized in an operon that is located next to and in  opposite direction to an operon whose expression is activated by CusR [11004187].  sensor proteins YedW, UhpB, and YedV, which also belong to two-component systems, can activate CusR via signal cross talk [15773991, 15522865].
<SSA>This protein binds to  CusR box, which is a <SSM>palindromic sequence</SSM> also conserved in or organisms</SSA>;  sequence is located in  regulatory regions of genes involved in copper-responsive systems and is regulated by proteins homologous to CusR [11004187]. In  whole genome of Escherichia coli, only one copper box has been identified [15773991].
