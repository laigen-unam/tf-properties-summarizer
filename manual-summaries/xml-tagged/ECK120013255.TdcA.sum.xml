During anaerobiosis, TdcA participates in controlling genes (tdc operon) involved in <RP>transport and metabolism of threonine and serine</RP> [8413189, 11251844, 7928991].
TdcA <EVF>belongs to  LysR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF>, and like  or members of this family, <DOM>it has a helix-turn-helix motif in  N-terminal domain for DNA binding [8413189]. </DOM> 
Although interaction between TdcA and  regulatory region of  tdc operon has not been demonstrated, it has been suggested that TdcA recognizes and binds to an <SSA><SSM>inverted repeat</SSM> located upstream of  operon</SSA> [7928991].
<TURO>tdcA is  first gene in  tdcABCDEFG operon</TURO>, which <TUR>is autoactivated by TdcA</TUR>. This operon is divergently transcribed with  tdcR gene, whose product also activates  transcription of  operon [2573820]. TdcA probably interacts with TdcR to activate transcription [7928991] and y appear to function toger with CRP and IHF, proteins that  bend  DNA, for this activation [11251844].
A mutation in  tdcA gene of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 causes  expression of OmpA protein which is involved, among several or processes, in cellular adherence [12933841].
tdc:  threonine dehydratase  [6327641].
