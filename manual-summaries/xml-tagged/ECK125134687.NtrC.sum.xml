Under nitrogen (N)-limiting conditions,  NtrC transcriptional dual regulator regulates genes involved  in <RP> <ACTCONDP>assimilation of nitrogen and in  minimization of  slow growth caused by  N-limited condition</ACTCONDP> [11121068]. Through a cascade of events NtrC appears to regulate as much as 2% of  genome, and many of se genes encode transport systems for nitrogen-containing compounds</RP> [11121068].
NtrC <EVF>belongs to  two-component system NtrB/NtrC [12730324] and is a member of  σ54-dependent activator family</EVF>, whose homologues are widely distributed in bacteria [10779705]. Both genes glnG, encoding  response regulator (NtrC, also called NRI), and glnL, encoding  sensor kinase (NtrB, also called NRII), are organized in  operon glnALG. glnA encodes a glutamine syntase[2882477].  In rich media,  transcription of glnALG is activated from  glnAp1 promoter by σ70 and under limiting ammonium is activated from  glnAp2 promoter by σ54 [8094391].
<ACTREG>NtrB functions as a membrane-associated protein kinase that in response to limitation of N and carbon-limited growth is autophosphorylated</ACTREG>. After that, NtrB transfers its phosphate group to NtrC to activate this transcriptional regulator [2858855, 2848245]. NtrB is also able to dephosphorylate to NtrC [2858855, 2848245]. On  or hand,  <ACTREG>NtrC is sometimes autophosphorylated with small-molecule phospho donors</ACTREG> [1356964].
<ACTREG><ACTCONDP>In  presence of N,  GlnB protein (also called PII) or  GlnK protein binds to NtrB to activate its phosphatase activity</ACTCONDP></ACTREG>.  NtrB-GlnB/GlnK complex dephosphorylates to NtrC or inhibits NtrC autophosphorylation, inactivating it [11063581, 15317778, 10074086, 9720863].  Under N deficiency, GlnB and GlnK are uridylylated (GlnB-UMP), and in this conformation se proteins cannot bind to NtrB [9720863, 9737855]. 
<DOM><ACTCONF>When  NtrC is phosphorylated ,  dimer, which is  inactive state of  protein, is disrupted and  ATPase domain is free to repack in  front-to-back orientation to form a hexamer or octamer ring</ACTCONF> [16751184, 14561776]. In this ring re is contact of  receiver domain of one subunit with  ATPase domain of a second one [16751184].
NtrC has three domains: an N-terminal receiver domain that contains  conserved Asp-54 residue that is phosphorylated [1321122, 8407777] a central ATP-binding AAA+ that cleaves ATP to produce energy  used in   process of open complex formation, mediates a phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization, and interacts with RNA polymerase  through  highly conserved GAFTGA motif [8407777, 12180911] and a C-terminal domain, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding and is involved in dimerization and in phosphorylation-independent oligomerization [8407777, 15208307].</DOM>
 NtrC-P binds to an inverted repeat sequence that can be located at a considerable distance from  start site of transcription [2871943, 12617754]. NtrC interacts with σ54-RNA polymerase through auxiliary DNA-binding proteins, such as FIS, via DNA looping [16553838].
