transcriptional dual regulator CynR,  cyanate regulator,  activates  expression of  cyn operon, which is involved in <RP>use of cyanate as a sole nitrogen source</RP>, in  presence of  inducer cyanate [3049588, 1592818]. It negatively regulates its own transcription independently of cyanate [1592818].
CynR <EVF>belongs to  family of LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs)</EVF> [1592818, 8253686]. <DOM>Members of this family have a conserved structure with an N-terminal DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif and a C-terminal cofactor-binding domain.</DOM> y typically form tetramers in solution that can be regarded as dimers of dimers [12706716, 19047729]. 
<DOM>In accordance with this,  CynR regulatory domain is sufficient for dimerization,</DOM> whereas  full-length protein behaves as a higher-order oligomer [19760662]. In systematic studies of oligomerization, it was shown that some members of  LysR family, like CynR, interact with or members of  family to form heterodimers, but  physiological significance of this is unknown [21187915].
promoter regions for  divergently transcribed cynR and cyn operons overlap. CynR binds cooperatively to a <SSA><SSZ>60-bp region</SSZ> that contains two 9-bp repeats separated by 34 bp</SSA>.  binding region overlaps  -35 region of  promoter for  cyn operon and both  -10 and -35 region of its own promoter [8253686, 7961413]. 
<ACTCONDP>CynR binds to DNA in  presence or absence of cyanate</ACTCONDP> and induces bending of  DNA [7961413]. Cyanate decreases  amount of bending, suggesting that  change in bending acts as a transcriptional switch.
