MazF is a toxin that is counteracted by  MazE antitoxin [8650219].  mazEF system causes a  <RP>programmed cell death  response to stresses including starvation [8650219] and antibiotics</RP> [11222603].  antitoxin, MazE, is subject to degradation by ClpP-ClpA protease complex and exhibits a short (30 minute) half life, whereas  toxin, MazF, is much more stable [8650219].  
 structure of  MazE-MazF complex is presented at 1.7 A resolution [12718874].  complex is hexameric and is comprised of a MazE homodimer sandwiched between MazF homodimers [12718874].
