MurR  N-acetyl muramic acid repressor,  represses genes involved in <RP> catabolism of cell wall sugars</RP> [18723630]. It represses transcription from  murQ promoter and <TUR>also interferes with its own transcription. murR and murQ are unique and now well-known genes that are regulated by MurR</TUR>. y are divergently orientated and expressed from nonoverlapping face-to-face (convergent) promoters, and ir transcripts are complementary at ir 5' ends [18723630].
MurR is a <EVF>member of  RpiR/AlsR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF>, <DOM>whose members contain two domains, a highly conserved N-terminal HTH domain and a C-terminal SIS (sugar phosphate isomerase/sugar phosphate-binding) domain [18723630, 10203754]. </DOM>It forms a stable multimer (most likely a tetramer) and binds to <SSA>two adjacent <SSM>inverted repeats</SSM> within  murR/murQ operator region</SSA>, preventing recruitment of RNA polymerase.
<ACTEFFE>MurNAc-6-P is  effector of MurR</ACTEFFE>. <DOM>MurR carries a so-called SIS domain in its C terminal which is involved in MurNAc-6-P binding.</DOM> Thus,  DNA-binding affinity of MurR is affected specifically by MurNAc-6-P. MurR functions as a repressor of  MurNAc pathway [18723630].
