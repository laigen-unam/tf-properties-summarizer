RcdA, also known as YbjK, <EVF>belongs to  TetR family</EVF> and is involved in  regulation of a number of <RP>stress response genes, biofilm formation, and transcription regulator genes</RP> [23233451].
Genomic SELEX analysis showed that RcdA can bind to  upstream regions of 27 genes. Among se predicted targets of RcdA, six genes correspond to transcription regulators (AppY, CsgD, FimB, RcdA, Sxy, and YcgF). This indicates that a large number of genes must be regulated indirectly by se regulators. Anor group of target genes includes membrane-associated stress response proteins (CsgB, NanC, OmpA, PgaA, YbjJ, YehA, and YoeA) and stress response cytoplasmic proteins (Asr and YdeI), among ors [23233451].
RcdA exhibits strong cooperative DNA binding and produces aggregates of RcdA-DNA complexes. In a specific way and with high binding affinity, this regulator recognizes and binds to sites that have closely related sequences. Furrmore, a consensus sequence has been proposed for RcdA sites. This consensus sequence shows a <SSA>core binding <SSZ>site of 9 bp</SSZ>, TTGTgtACA, with <SSM>inverted repeat symmetry</SSM></SSA> [23233451]. According to  analysis performed by  curator,  consensus sequence has a length of 10 bp (TTGTgtACAa).
