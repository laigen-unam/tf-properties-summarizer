transcription factor DicA,  Division cell,  is a temperature-sensitive repressor that controls  transcription of genes involved in <RP> cell division process</RP> [3911021, 3532030, 3041373, 2666395] and <TUR>activation of its own expression</TUR> [23028867]. Neverless, <ACTCONDP><ACTCONDN> signal to which DicA responds is still unknown.</ACTCONDN></ACTCONDP> <EVF> family to which DicA belongs has not been established</EVF>; <DOM>it is a protein of 15 kDa with a hypotical DNA-binding domain in  N-terminal domain [3532030].</DOM> DicA is homologous in structure and function to RovA (Yersinia) and SlyA (Salmonella), both of which are activators for pathogenicity-related genes [23028867].
