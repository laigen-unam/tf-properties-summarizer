SlyA (for  hemolytic protein in Salmonella ) was initially identified in Salmonella, although little is known about  regulator role of SlyA. It has been demonstrated that SlyA increases expression of <RP>hemolysin E</RP> by antagonizing  negative effects of H-NS [10027972, 14996792]. 
SlyA <EVF>belongs to  MarR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF>.<DOM> This protein consist of two domains, an amino-terminal domain involved in dimerization and a carboxy-terminal domain indispensable for DNA recognition [12649270]. </DOM>
<SSA>It is known that SlyA recognizes a <SSM>short palindromic DNA sequence</SSM> of <SSZ>12 bp</SSZ></SSA> [14996792].
