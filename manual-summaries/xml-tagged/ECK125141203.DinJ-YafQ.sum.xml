YafQ-DinJ toxin-antitoxin system was identified by its similarity to  RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin system [9767574].  Expression of YafQ alone reduces <RP>protein synsis and inhibits growth, and coexpression of DinJ alleviates that phenotype</RP>, acting as  antitoxin [17263853, 17367382, 19210620].  
YafQ and DinJ form a stable complex [17263853] which can bind to  dinJ-yafQ <SSM>palindrome</SSM> upstream of  translation start site [19210620].
A strain from which all five toxin-antitoxin systems have been deleted shows no deficiency in its stress response or competitiveness under nutrient-limited conditions [17513477].  However, biofilm formation is affected via expression of  TabA protein [19060153].  A dinJ-yafQ deletion mutant is impaired in <RP>biofilm formation</RP> [19707553].
Deletion of any single toxin-antitoxin system encoding an RNase has no effect on persister formation, but deleting ten such systems dramatically reduces persister formation.  Persister formation depends on degradation of  antitoxins by  Lon protease [21788497].
A crystal structure of  DinJ-YafQ complex has been resolved at 1.8 Ã… [24898247].
