YefM is a transcriptional DNA-binding autorepressor for  yefM-yoeB operon. In addition, YefM also functions as an antitoxin to form a complex with YoeB, which is a toxin that is counteracted by YefM antitoxin [17170003]. <ACTCONDP>YefM can bind alone with low affinity to  yefM-yoeB operator, but toger with YoeB it has an enhanced DNA-binding affinity compared to free YefM</ACTCONDP> [17170003]. YoeB enhances  interaction with YefM by affecting  YefM conformation to one that is more favorable for DNA binding and/or by stabilizing  nucleoprotein complex at  operator site and reducing basal expression of <TUL> yefM-yoeB operon</TUL> [17170003, 19028895].
<TUR> yefM gene is upregulated during growth in biofilms [14727089] and yefM-yoeB is upregulated in persister cells</TUR> [16768798] it is probable that derepression of yefM-yoeB autoregulation occurs in se circumstances in response to an as-yet-unknown environmental or cell cycle signal(s) that interferes with  YefM-YoeB-operator interaction [19028895].
operator site 5' of yefM-yoeB comprises adjacent long (L) and short (S) <SSA>palindromes with core 5'-TGTACA-3' motifs with a center-to-center distance of 12 bp</SSA> [17170003]  which was suggested to be  crucial for  correct stable positioning of YefM-YoeB at  two repeats [19028895]. This sequence organization is common in yefM-yoeB regulatory regions in diverse genomes, suggesting that interaction of YefM-YoeB with se motifs is a conserved mechanism of operon autoregulation [17170003].
Neverless, YefM originally was described as a native unstructured protein [14672926] later it was reevaluated as experimental, and modeling data have demonstrated that  protein is at least partially folded [17170003, 11735370]and dimeric [17170003].
YefM antitoxin forms a heterotrimeric complex with  YoeB toxin (YefM2-YoeB) [15980067, 16109374].  tertiary structure of  YoeB toxin and  YefM2-YoeB complex has been described [16109374]. <DOM>In  complex, one C terminus in  YefM homodimer is unfolded and  or one shows an Î±-helical conformation and conceals  endoribonuclease fold of YoeB. Two N-terminal segments of YefM form a symmetrical dimer within  YefM2-YoeB heterotrimeric complex and do not contact YoeB directly [19028895].
YefM does not possess a canonical DNA-binding motif, but instead a pair of basic residues, R10 and R31, conserved in many YefM homologs are absolutely necessary for DNA binding by  YefM-YoeB complex [12603745, 19028895, 16109374].</DOM>
