EnvY  is a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator that participates in  control of several genes that encode <RP>cellular envelope proteins</RP> at low temperatures and during stationary phase [6317653].
<DOM>This protein is an envelope protein [6317653]that contains a putative membrane-spanning region, and as for  <EVF>members of  family of transcriptional regulators (AraC/XylS) that it pertains to</EVF> [8451183] it also contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding in  C-terminal region [8451183, 7503752].</DOM> 
 transcriptional regulators of E. coli that show higher similarity to EnvR are AppY and AdiY [7503752].  latter, like EnvY, also has a putative transmembrane region [7503752].
No research has been done to determine  DNA-binding sites for EnvY.
<TUR> regulation of envY has not been described yet</TUR>, but a region of dyad symmetry has been found upstream of this gene [8704970].
EnvY:  envelope polypeptide  [6317653].
