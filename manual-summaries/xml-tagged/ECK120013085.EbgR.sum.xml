EbgR (for  evolved β-galactosidase repressor) negatively regulates genes involved in  evolved <RP>β-galactosidase system</RP>, which constitutes an alternative for lactose utilization in cells with mutations on  lacZ gene [3939708, 10234816].
wild-type Ebg enzyme, encoded by  ebg operon, is not efficient enough to permit growth on lactose. Mutations in ebgR and ebgA, however, enhance its catalytic activity and enable rapid growth on lactose as a sole carbon source [3939708, 10234816].
EbgR <EVF>belongs to  GalR-LacI family of transcriptional regulators</EVF>. re is strong evidence that  ebg and lac operons share a common origin in evolution [3939708]. EbgR diverged from or repressors shortly after  divergence of  Gram positive from  Gram negative eubacteria, approximately 2.2 billion years ago [12868605].
