PhoP is a dual transcriptional regulator that <ACTCONDP>is activated in response to low extracellular levels of divalent cations</ACTCONDP>, e.g., magnesium or calcium [1530848, 1729240, 10464230]. In Escherichia coli K-12, PhoP activates transcription of a large collection of genes involved in <RP>Mg2+ homeostasis, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, acid resistance, and LPS modification</RP> [10464230, 12813061, 17909183].
PhoP <EVF>belongs to  OmpR/PhoB subfamily of response regulators</EVF> <DOM>characterized by a winged-helix DNA-binding domain.  structure of  N-terminal receiver domain has been solved in  absence and presence of  phosphoryl analog beryllofluoride [17545283].</DOM> <ACTREG><ACTCONF>PhoP is phosphorylated and reby activated</ACTCONF> by its cognate sensor kinase PhoQ</ACTREG> at a low extracellular concentration of magnesium. At high levels of magnesium  phospho-PhoP phosphatase activity of  sensor protein is induced [10807931].
Regulation of  PhoQ/PhoP system is connected to  EvgS/EvgA system through  small inner membrane protein B1500.  EvgS/EvgA system is involved in acid resistance and directly regulates expression of B1500. B1500 interacts with PhoQ and increases  level of PhoP phosphorylation [17998538].
PhoP-P <SSA>binds to tandemly arranged binding sites known as PhoP boxes, consisting of <SSM>two direct repeats</SSM> separated by 5 nucleotides</SSA> [10464230]. <DOM> C-terminal domain of  σ subunit (σ CTD) is required for  recruitment of RNA polymerase [12123454].</DOM>
