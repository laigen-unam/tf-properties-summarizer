According to microarray analysis,   mannosyl-d-glycerate regulator,  MngR, regulates only two genes, mngA and mngB, involved in <RP>2-O-Î±-mannosyl-D-glycerate utilization</RP> [14645248].  <TUR>This regulator also autoregulates its own synsis</TUR> [7805834].
Previously, MngR, also called FarR, for fatty acyl-responsive regulator, had been proposed to regulate genes involved in  citric acid cycle in response to fatty acids, which release MngR from its DNA-binding site [7805834].  However, when it was found that this protein only regulates two genes,  suggestion was rejected and it was proposed that probably high concentrations of fatty acids could degrade  protein instead of it binding to  regulator [14645248].  
MngR <EVF>belongs to  GntR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> and <DOM>has a helix-turn-helix motif in  N-terminal domain and a UbiC transcription regulator-associated domain that is predicted to be a sensor for small molecules. </DOM> This domain is found in proteins such as UbiC from Escherichia coli, TreR from Bacillus subtilis, and HutC from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12757941].
mntR gene is transcribed divergently from  mngAB operon. y share a regulatory region that contains two sites of 21 bp each, one with two direct repeat sequences of 10 bp that are bound by MngR [7805834].
mngR shows differential codon adaptation, resulting in differential translation efficiency signatures, in rmophilic microbes.  It was refore predicted to play a role in  heat shock response.  An mngR deletion mutant was shown to be more sensitive than wild-type specifically to heat shock, but not or stresses [24580753].
