Propionate Regulator,  PrpR, is a transcription factor that controls expression of genes involved in <RP>catabolism of propionate</RP> [15805526]. <ACTREG>It <TUR>is negatively autoregulated</TUR></ACTREG>, sensitive to catabolite control, and coordinately activates transcription of a divergent operon related to propionate catabolism [15805526]. Synsis of this operon is induced when E. coli is grown in  absence of glucose or glycerol. 
PrpR <EVF>belongs to  NtrC family of activators</EVF>, which interact directly with  RpoN RNA polymerase [7934866]. <EVF>PrpR is a Ïƒ54-dependent activator and belongs to  AAA+ superfamily of mechano-chemical ATPases</EVF>.<DOM> It consists of three domains, an amino-terminal domain involved in effector recognition, a catalytic domain, and a carboxy-terminal DNA-binding domain [15528672].</DOM> <SSA>This regulator binds to a <SSM>palindromic sequence</SSM> (5'-GTTTCAT-10n-ATGAAAC-3') that overlaps prpRp</SSA> [15805526].
