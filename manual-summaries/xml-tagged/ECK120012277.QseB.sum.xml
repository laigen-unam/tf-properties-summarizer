QseB, quorum-sensing E. coli regulator B , is  response regulator component of  QseB-QseC two-component system, which is one component of  quorum-sensing regulatory cascade involved in  positive regulation of flagella and motility genes by activating transcription of flhDC, an operon that encodes  master regulator of se genes [11929534].
This protein also may have an undetermined role in <RP>metal metabolism</RP>, because qseBC deletion mutants show hypersensitivity to several toxic cations [12897016].
QseB and QseC of enterohemorrhagic  E. coli (EHEC) and of E. coli K-12 are almost identical; re are only three amino acid differences in QseB and only eight amino acid differences in QseC between se strains [11929534]. It was demonstrated in EHEC that <ACTREG>QseC directly senses and binds  bacterial hormone-like AI-3 signal and  host epineprhine/norepineprhine hormones, and it causes  autophosphorylation of QseC, which n transfers  phosphate group to QseB to activate it </ACTREG>[16803956].
<TUR> expression of  operon containing both genes qseB, encoding  response regulator, and qseC, encoding  sensor kinase, is regulated by a quorum-sensing system</TUR> [11929534], and  regulatory region of  operon is 99.6% identical to  regulatory region of  same operon in EHEC [16194231].
