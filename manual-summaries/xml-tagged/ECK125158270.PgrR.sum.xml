Based on analysis with  Genomic SELEX screening system, PgrR was identified as a repressor of  expression of genes of <RP> initial enzymes for peptidoglycan (PG) peptide degradation as well as genes of  switch control between recycling and degradation of PG peptides</RP>, which are induced upon exposure to heat shock or membrane distortion [23301696].
PgrR negatively controls ycjY-ymjD-ymjC-mpaA operon expression and binds to  <SSM>palindromic sequence</SSM>g ATCATTT-AAATGAT [23301696]. Both  pgrR and ycjY promoters are recognized by RpoH (σ32) and RpoE (σ24), both of which are involved in  heat shock response, and by FecI (σ19), which is involved in  response to extracytoplasmic stimuli [23301696].
Eleven possible targets were predicted to be under PgrR control. se targets were identified by Genomic SELEX analysis and include genes related to <RP>membrane formation and function</RP>: leuL, leuO, pheP, ycjY, pgrR, yedS, xapR, yfgF, yfgG, rfaL, and rfaS [23301696].
PgrR, Peptide glycan recycling Regulator.
A ycjZ mutant shows a defect in <RP>swarming motility</RP>, but no defect in swimming motility [17122336].
