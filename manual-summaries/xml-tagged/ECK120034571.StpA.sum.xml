StpA protein, for  Suppressor of td phenotype A,  is a nucleoid-associated multifunctional protein [10551881, 10947847]that acts as a transcriptional repressor [16980475] in <RP>chromosomal DNA packaging [22187157] and as a chaperone [17267410, 15849314]. When StpA binds DNA, it is able to form a rigid filament, and thus  access to DNA is blocked [22187157]. <TUR><ACTREG>This protein is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG></TUR> [16980475]and it is involved in  %Beta;-glucoside utilization systems [16980475, 11737635, 9473058]and  homologous recombination and repair of bleomycin damage [17991999]. Gueun%e'; et al. suggested that StpA may regulate  expression of a tributyltin-inducible operon </RP>[18245262].  Currently, no inducer for this regulator has been reported in  literature. New genes may be identified by high-throughput analysis [19151137].
It is a DNA-binding protein with similarity to H-NS [7961433, 1480493] and se two proteins can have similar functions [10515926, 10947847]. It has an approximately fivefold-greater affinity for DNA than H-NS and has a preference for curved DNA [11278075]. This regulator binds <SSA>curved DNA, in  promoter region, with AT-rich motifs</SSA>, and StpA binds to sites that have poorly related sequences and it does not have a consensus sequence for  DNA binding. 
Expression of stpA from a plasmid can complement an hns mutant phenotype and StpA is able to repress and activate a subset of H-NS-regulated genes, but ir specific mechanisms remain to be determined [7961433, 11278075, 8890170, 8635467, 19151137, 8890170]. A dominant negative form of StpA can disrupt H-NS activity and vice versa, and H-NS can interact with StpA at two distinct domains to form heterodimers in vitro; also re exists evidence that some of se proteins can form homodimers [11244076, 8755860, 10203842, 8755860]. For this reason, in  absence of H-NS  StpA protein is rapidly degraded in a Lon protease-dependent manner [11244076, 10485902] protection from proteolytic degradation appears to be mediated by direct interaction between StpA and H-NS [11244076]. On  or hand StpA may form heteromeric complexes with Hha and YdgT [15458420]. 
<DOM>StpA consists of two structured domains which are separated by a protease-sensitive linker [9643551].  N-terminal domain is involved in  protein-protein interaction, while  purified C-terminal domain alone promotes annealing of RNA oligonucleotides and trans-splicing in vitro [17901153, 9643551, 10203842, 8755860]. Repression of  bglG operon by StpA occurs as a molecular adapter  [9473058, 11737635]and only in  presence of  N-terminal H-NS protein domain, which comprises  core for dimerization [16980475]. </DOM>
StpA has RNA chaperone activity in vitro and in vivo, and  RNA chaperone activity of StpA is influenced by  structural stability of  RNA target molecule  [17901153, 8635467, 7493324, 10393192, 12208852, 12440999, 15849314]. StpA may destabilize  small regulatory RNA MicF [11601842, 11029695].
