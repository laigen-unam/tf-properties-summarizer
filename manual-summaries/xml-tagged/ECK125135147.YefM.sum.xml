YoeB and YefM are a toxin-antitoxin pair [12603745].
YefM has similarity to  Axe protein of  Txe-Axe toxin-antitoxin pair, which is encoded by a multidrug resistance episome isolated from Enterococcus faecium [12603745].
YefM protein appears to lack secondary structure, and <ACTCONF>its native conformation is proposed to be unfolded.</ACTCONF>  A linear recognition element which can be recognized by YoeB was identified using peptide array technology [14672926].
Regulation has been described [14727089].  <TUCREG>Transcription is induced upon biofilm formation</TUCREG> [14727089].
