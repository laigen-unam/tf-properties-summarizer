Nac,  Nitrogen assimilation control,  regulates, without a coeffector, genes involved in <RP>nitrogen metabolism</RP> under  nitrogen-limiting conditions [9495755].
genes regulated by Nac are transcribed by RNA polymerase σ70. se genes are coupled to  nitrogen regulatory (Ntr) system, which is σ54 dependent, through Nac, whose <TUCREG>transcription is activated by NtrC</TUCREG> [9495755]. Using DNA microarray analyses, it was shown that Nac could affect  expression of 25 genes [11121068]. <ACTREG>This transcriptional regulator is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG> [9495755] and <ACTCONDP>is expressed under nitrogen-limiting conditions</ACTCONDP> [9785451].
Nac <EVF>belongs to  LysR family</EVF> [9495755] <DOM>and features a helix-turn-helix motif located close to  N terminus [9922258].</DOM> In contrast with most LysR family members, which are transcribed divergently from  gene y regulate, nac is distant on  genome from its regulated genes [9495755].
In Klebsiella pneumoniae, Nac functions as a dimer, and for some sites it can bind as a tetramer; it recognizes long and short sites in  absence of a coeffector [20363946].
