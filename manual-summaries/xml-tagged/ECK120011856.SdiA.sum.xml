transcription factor SdiA, for  Suppressor of  cell division inhibitor,  <TUR>is possibly positively autoregulated</TUR> and controls  transcription of  genes involved in <RP>cell division [8631660, 8552633, 11555297, 1915297, 11244066]. SdiA has been shown to increase transcription from  P2 promoter of  ftsQAZ operon [8552633] by facilitating RNA polymerase binding to  promoter region [11555297]. SdiA activates  expression of ydiV, which is involved in  interaction between two quorum-sensing systems</RP>. An sdiA ydiV double mutant reduces cAMP levels, which inhibits quorum-sensing system 2 [18560382]. <TUR>Expression of sdiA itself is regulated by a mechanism similar to quorum sensing</TUR>: exposure to conditioned medium results in a 50-80% decrease in sdiA expression [8631660].  transcriptional activity of SdiA is affected not only by quorum signaling but also by or environmental factors, such as oxidation [24598739].
Overexpression of SdiA speeds up cell division [1915297] and causes apparently concomitant morphological changes; in both exponential and stationary phases, cells appear rounder and shorter [11244065]. Overexpression of SdiA also leads to resistance to  DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C as well as to or drugs [11244065, 11244066] while an sdiA null mutant strain was not hypersensitive to mitomycin C [11244065] but was more sensitive to flouroquinolones [11929524]. In addition, SdiA also affects  expression of a number of genes, including a decrease in expression of several <RP>motility [20126629] and chemotaxis [11244066] genes,  a pleiotropic effect over  expression of genes involved in cell division, drug sensitivity, DNA replication and repair, macromolecular metabolism [11244066] genes involved in  glutamate-dependent acid resistance systems (AR-2) [20126629] and an increase in  expression of  AcrAB multidrug efflux pump proteins</RP> [11929524].  
On  or hand, SdiA is <EVF>highly homologous to quorum-sensing transcription factors that belong to  LuxR family</EVF> [11544237, 15130116, 11115115, 16307757].  molecule inducer is represented by different N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs), which are signaling molecules involved in communication between bacteria (quorum-sensing systems) [15130116, 16487323, 19168658, 11292813, 15995228, 16487745, 8631660, 20126629, 24598739]. AHLs might control  transcriptional activity of SdiA by enhancing its stability rar than by directly affecting its DNA-binding affinity [24598739]. Lee et al. showed that  transcription which SdiA mediates is controlled by indole, but wher this effect is indirect or direct is not known [17511876, 18528414]. However, it was experimentally shown that SdiA does not respond to indole, although it can inhibit SdiA activity [22610437]. On  or hand Dyszel et al. showed that  SdiA protein is partially dependent upon a diffusible molecule [N-(3-oxo-hexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone] [17511876, 18528414, 20126629].
<DOM>Accordingly, this family protein is composed of two domains: a conserved C-terminal  domain which contains  DNA-binding region [11115115] and  N-terminal domain, which is  involved in effector binding  [16307757].</DOM> 
 crystal structure of intact SdiA has been determined [24598739].
