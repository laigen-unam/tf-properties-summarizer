Galactose isorepressor,  GalS, is a DNA-binding transcription factor that represses transcription of  operons involved in <RP>transport and catabolism of D-galactose</RP> [17630975, 7934815, 8416900, 1619663, 8982002]. Synsis of se operons is induced when E. coli is grown in  presence of  inducer (D-galactose) and   absence glucose [8982002, 7934815, 1619663, 8416900]. <TUR><ACTREG>GalS is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG></TUR>, and <TUCREG><ACTCONDP>its expression is increased in  presence of inducer and glucose</ACTCONDP></TUCREG> [8416900, 8982002]. 
On  or hand, <EVPIT>GalS is highly homologous in its amino acid sequence to GalR (55% identical and 88% similar)</EVPIT>; apparently both act toger and are capable of cross-talking to regulate expression of  gal regulon [1619663, 8982002]. For this reason se regulators bind  same operators, in  cis regulatory regions, with different affinities. 
In  presence of an inductor, GalS undergoes a conformational change that reduces its affinity for  operator. Golding et al. showed that GalR is  major repressor of  gal operon [1655705]. <SSA>This repressor binds in tandem to <SSM>inverted repeat sequences</SSM> that are <SSZ>16 nucleotides long</SSZ> and possess conserved motifs</SSA>; each dimer binds to one of se conserved sequences [7934815, 8416900]. 
GalS <EVF>belongs to  GalR/LacI family of transcriptional regulators</EVF>. Accordingly,<DOM> this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: a conserved N-terminal domain which contains  DNA-binding region, and  carboxy-terminal domain, which is involved in effector binding and dimerization [1619663, 8982002]. GalS and GalR have only two substitutions in  first helix of  N-terminal domain [1619663].</DOM>
