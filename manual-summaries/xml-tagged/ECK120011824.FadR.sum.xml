FadR, Fatty acid degradation Regulon [4887396] is a multifunctional dual regulator [2843809] that exerts negative control over  <RP>fatty acid degradative regulon [6247326, 7009562] and acetate metabolism [7026540] whereas it is responsible for maximal expression of unsaturated fatty acid biosynsis [6341354]. FadR coordinately regulates fatty acid biosynsis and fatty acid degradation at  level of transcription [8446033]. In this way, FadR functions as a switch between fatty acid β-oxidation and fatty acid biosynsis [11279025].
FadR is a global regulator of lipid metabolism, as it activates multiple operons responsible for fatty acid synsis [23772072]. FadR activates  fabH promoter in  absence of long-chain fatty acids</RP> [23772072].
FadR <EVF>belongs to  GntR family</EVF> [11013219, 2060763]. However, Xu et al. (2001) reported that homologies to CAP and  Tet repressor based on structure are more relevant and y have categorized FadR as a chimera of two motifs [11279025].
<DOM>FadR appears to be a two-domain dimeric molecule in which  N-terminal domains [7836365, 9388199, 1569108, 2843809] bind to DNA, whereas  C-terminal domain binds  fatty acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) [11279025]. In addition, re is a linker that connects both  N-terminal and C-terminal. FadR binds DNA as an apo-protein, and it is released when it binds long-chain acyl-CoA [9767562].  binding of  acyl-CoA disrupts a buried network of charged and polar residues in  C-terminal domain, and  resulting conformational change is transmitted to  N-terminal domain via a domain-spanning α-helix CoA [11279025] in this way re is loss of DNA binding [10739923] since acyl-CoA regulates DNA binding by FadR [1569108, 9045847].
 α/β N-terminal domain (α1-β1-α2-α3-β2-β3) has a winged-helix motif, and  α-helical C-terminal domain (α6-α7-α8-α9-α10-α11-α12) resembles  sensor domain of  Tet repressor [11279025]and PAS domain, in particular  photoactive yellow protein [10739923] and finally  linker comprising two short α-helices (α4-α5) [11279025].
 binding of FadR to DNA is determined by  localization of  α3 recognition helices that are paired toger at  dimer interface [11279025].
 DNA-binding domain is very highly conserved among FadR-containing bacteria, whereas  C-terminal acyl-CoA-binding domain shows only weak conservation [16027119].</DOM>
A FadR-type regulator has been identified in Vibrio vulnificus [18835990] Corynebacterium glutamicum [18039772] Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholerae, Pasteurella multocida, and Hemophilus influenzae [16027119].
FadR is a homodimer [9388199, 11279025] that <SSA>recognizes a <SSM>palindromic sequence</SSM>, 5'-TGGNNNNNCCA-3'</SSA> [11279025].
Overexpression of FadR improves fatty acid production by 5- to 7.5-fold over that of strains in which it is not overexpressed [23026122]. Genes related to  stress response proteins and fatty acid biosyntic pathways are upregulated by FadR [23026122]. An increase of organic solvent tolerances (OSTs) was shown by using  fadR and marR double mutant of those two transcriptional regulators [23053109].
