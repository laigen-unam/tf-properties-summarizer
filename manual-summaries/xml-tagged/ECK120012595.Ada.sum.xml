transcription factor Ada, for  Adaptive response to alkylation damage,  <ACTREG>is positively autoregulated</ACTREG> [7937881, 3139888] and controls  transcription of  genes involved in <RP> process of reparation of alkylated DNA</RP> [7937881, 7713936, 8002588, 3529081, 10049384, 7556074, 7937881] also called  adaptive response [2843522, 17823664, 11073893] O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine are  major mutagenic lesions resulting from exposure of DNA to simple alkylating agents such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and, to a lesser degree, methane methanesulfonate (MMS) [2843522, 3529081, 7937881, 17823664]. 
 O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine alkylation products constitute potentially mutagenic lesions due to ir tendency to mispair with thymine and with guanine, respectively, forming transition mutations. 
In Escherichia coli re are two separate direct repair mechanisms for  reversal of se types of alkylating lesions through  involvement of two methyltransferases, Ada and Ogt [17823664].
<DOM>This regulator contains two functional domains: an N-terminal domain, which contains a motif for DNA binding, and  C-terminal domain, which is involved in  interaction with  RNA polymerase [11073893, 3887409, 6092060, 1924363, 3141384, 8468304, 9582376]. This regulator <RP>removes methyl groups (as well as larger groups) from  guanine and thymine substrates and transfers m to its own cysteine residue (Cys-321) in  C-terminal domain.  Ada protein also transfers methyl groups to a second cysteine residue (Cys-69) in  N-terminal domain, from alkylphosphotriesters in DNA</RP>  [6765195, 11073893, 8720133, 3058696, 17823664, 3047400].</DOM> This reaction converts  Ada protein into a strong transcriptional activator of several genes. 
This regulator acts as an activator by binding to cis-acting elements that overlap   upstream elements (UP) of  promoters regulated [7713936, 11073893, 8468304, 2648001].
A model of  mechanism of action of Ada has been proposed  [11073893, 9582376].
 solution structure of  methylated N-terminal domain of Ada has been determined by NMR and mass spectrometry [16452614].
We have modified  reported <SSA>length of  binding site of this protein to <SSZ>13 bp</SSZ></SSA>, according to  proposal by Teo et al [3009022]. Or authors have proposed different lengths and consensus sequences for Ada [2648001, 7713936], but Nakamura et al showed that deletions in this consensus sequence (AAANNAAAGCGCA) decrease  activity of Î²-galactosidase [3139888].
