During anaerobiosis, TdcR participates in controlling several genes involved in <RP>transport and metabolism of threonine and serine </RP> [2573820, 11251844, 7928991].  
<EVPIT><DOM>TdcR has a helix-turn-helix motif</DOM> that shows 25% and 35% identity to  same motifs of  transcriptional regulators NtrC and Fis</EVPIT>, respectively [2573820].  
It appears that due to  fact that  tdcR gene shows poor codon usage and a poor Shine-Dalgarno sequence, it is weakly expressed [2573820]. tdcR is transcribed alone and <TUL>is  located divergently in  genome from  operon (tdcABCD)</TUL>, whose transcription is activated by TdcR.  first gene of  operon codes for <ACTEFFE>TdcA, a transcriptional regulator that probably interacts with TdcR to activate  transcription of  operon</ACTEFFE> [7928991] and se two proteins appear to function toger with CRP and IHF, proteins that bend  DNA, for this activation [11251844].
tdc:  threonine dehydratase  [6327641].
