transcriptional repressor HipB, for  High persistence,  <ACTREG>is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG> and controls  transcription of a critical persistence factor [19129642, 15807669, 15576765, 1715862, 14622409, 15308767]. <TURO>hipB foms an operon with hipA</TURO>, and  products of this operon are classified as a toxin (HipA)-antitoxin (HipB) system. This HipAB system is involved in <RP> high persistence, which is  capacity of  bacteria to survive prolonged exposure to antibiotics </RP>[15308767, 17001682], and Kawano et al. also showed that this system is important for survival during  long-term stationary phase [19129642, 15807669, 15576765]. 
crystal structure of  HipB-HipA-DNA complex has been solved at 2.68 Ã… resolution [19150849].  complex is tetrameric and is comprised of a HipB homodimer that interacts with DNA, sandwiched by a monomer of HipA on each side [19150849]. In  HipB-HipA complex, each monomer of HipA interacts with two monomers of HipB [19150849, 19622872]. HipB is an antitoxin that counteracts and neutralizes  HipA toxin, and HipA is toxic in  absence of its binding partner HipB [19150849, 8021189, 1715862]. Although HipA does not bind  Hip regulatory region, it plays an indirect role via its binding to HipB. 
<DOM>HipB contains a helix-turn-helix motif near  N terminus and is a Cro-like DNA-binding protein.</DOM> It binds to four operator sites with  <SSA>conserved <SSM>inverted repeat sequence</SSM> motif TATCCN8GGATA</SSA>, and its binding occurs cooperatively and almost simultaneously on  same face of  DNA helix.  HipB forms dimers in solution [8021189, 19150849].
