RtcR ,  RNA terminal phosphate cyclase regulator,  regulates  expression of genes involved in <RP>  ATP-dependent conversion of a 3'-phosphate at  end of RNA to 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester </RP>[9738023].
RtcR <EVF>belongs to  group of σ54-dependent transcriptional regulators</EVF>, which <DOM>contain three domains:  sensory domain located in  N terminus,  central domain involved in ATP hydrolysis and interaction with σ54, and  C-terminal domain, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif. Although  C-terminal domain and  central domain from RtcR are similar to those of or members of this group, its N-terminal domain is not [9738023].</DOM>
rtcR gene is transcribed divergently from  genes it regulates [9738023].
