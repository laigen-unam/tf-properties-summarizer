Phenylethylamine regulator,  FeaR, is considered an activator of <RP>phenylacetate synsis from 2-phenylethylamine (PEA). <ACTREG>This regulator is regulated by catabolic repression</ACTREG>, and highly expressed in  presence of succinate [8631685]. FeaR controls expression of a pathway for  degradation of potentially toxic aromatic compounds [24013633]. <ACTCONDP>It is induced by tyramine, and in  absence of glucose, it activates  expression of amine oxidase and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase</ACTCONDP>, proteins involved in 2-phenylethylamine catabolism </RP>[9043126, 8647101, 24013633]. Although it has not been  possible to test  ligand binding to FeaR, se data and those of ors suggest that it is a substrate or intermediate of  TynA/FeaB pathway, as it is more likely that <ACTEFFE>an aldehyde (tyramine) is  direct inducer for  PEA catabolic pathway and a likely coeffector of FeaR</ACTEFFE> [24013633]. 
<DOM>FeaR <EVF>belongs to  AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> [9043126, 8631685]. This protein consists of two domains, an amino-terminal domain (NTD) involved in co-inducer recognition and dimerization and a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif [9043126, 8631685]. Activation by FeaR requires  NTD, which could function as an inhibitor of  CTD in  absence of  coactivator [24013633].</DOM>
<SSA> FeaR-binding site is a <SSM>direct repeat</SSM> of <SSZ>two 16-bp</SSZ> elements with  core consensus sequence TGKCA-N8-MAA (where K is G or T and M is C or A) for each 16-bp sequence</SSA> [24013633].
