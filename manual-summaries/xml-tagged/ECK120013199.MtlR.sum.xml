transcriptional activator MtlR, for  Mannitol Rrgulator,   is capable of controlling its own synsis [8300537] and it controls  transcription of  operon involved in <RP>mannitol utilization</RP> [8300537]. <ACTCONDP>MtlR in  presence of just mannitol produces derepression of  mtlADR operon</ACTCONDP>, but when glucose is present in  medium, this operon is a target of catabolite repression (through CRP), independent of MtlR  [8300537]. MtlA takes up exogenous mannitol, releasing  phosphate ester, mannitol-1-P, into  cell cytoplasm, but it is not clear which of  two metabolites is  inducer of MtlR [8300537].
To repress transcription, MtlR recognizes DNA-binding sites that overlap  initiation site for transcription of  mtlADR operon, preventing RNA polymerase binding [8300537] but no consensus sequence has been identified. Figger et al. proposed that an inverted repeat sequence of 24 bp is  possible MtlR-binding site [8300537]. 
MtlR <EVF>belongs to  Pfam 05068 family</EVF>, a new class of transcription factors in bacteria that may regulate gene expression indirectly as part of a larger transcriptional complex [19840941, 14681378].
crystal structures of MtlR from Vibrio parahaemolyticus and its homolog,  YggD protein from Shigella flexneri, have been determined [19840941].
