SoxR protein, for  Superoxide Response protein,  <ACTREG>is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG> and controls  transcription of  regulon involved in <RP>defense against redox-cycling drugs [1696718, 1400156, 11703180, 21226770] and in responses to nitric oxide</RP> [1695893, 12889026, 1631070, 11470373, 10097071, 10559844, 11885291, 18449575, 11073934, 11530938].  SoxR <EVF>belongs to  MerR family</EVF> and is a homodimer in solution [7673113, 8631739].
<DOM>SoxR contains two essential [2Fe-2S] clusters for its transcriptional activity [11179804].  Each SoxR polypeptide contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster that senses  oxidants in  cell.</DOM>  Both Fe-SoxR and apo-SoxR bind to  promoter region, but only Fe-SoxR contributes to  activation <ACTCONF>in its oxidized form</ACTCONF>  [8790350, 8816757, 8306957, 7673113, 8631739].  <ACTREG> redox state of  iron-sulfur cluster regulates SoxR activity</ACTREG>  [9019397, 9030573]. 
It has long been known that SoxR senses superoxide [8631739, 18755976, 1659949]; however, Gu and Imlay (2011) concluded that SoxR actually senses redox-cycling agents [21226770]. But Liochev and Fridovich reported that  superoxide is indeed sensed by SoxR [21459140].<DOM>  metal core structural and redox  states of  metal  active sites of SoxR in  presence and absence of O2 and/or NO have been determined [22266921].</DOM>
SoxR and SoxS are two transcription factors that govern a set of genes [1317841] in which  two regulators act sequentially [1653416, 1400156, 8226698, 12169597, 14594836, 15009903, 16549675]. SoxR induces soxS expression, and SoxS, in turn, activates transcription of genes of  regulon [11145103].
