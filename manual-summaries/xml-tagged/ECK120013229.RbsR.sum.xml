transcription factor RbsR, for  Ribose Repressor,  <TUR><ACTREG>is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG></TUR> and controls  transcription of  operon involved in ribose catabolism and transport [1304369, 6327616, 11750821]. Transcription of this operon is induced when E. coli is grown in  absence of glucose and when  physiological inducer D-ribose binds to  RbsR repressor [11750821, 3011793]. <ACTCONDN>When D-ribose binds to RbsR,  protein becomes inactive</ACTCONDN> because  binding affinity of RbsR decreases [1304369].
RbsR represses not only  rbs operon for <RP>transport and utilization of D-ribose but also  de novo synsis of purine nucleotides from D-ribose 5-phosphate. In  presence of  inducer D-ribose, RbsR activates  salvage pathway of purine nucleotide synsis</RP> [23651393].
<ACTREG>Although little is known about  mechanism of regulation of  RbsR transcription factor, Mauzy et al. in 1992 demonstrated that this regulator acts as a repressor by binding to cis-acting elements, which have a conserved <SSM>inverted repeat sequence</SSM> and overlap  rbsD promoter</ACTREG> [1304369]. 
RbsR <EVF>belongs to  GalR/LacI family</EVF>, which <DOM>forms a bundle of four helices characteristic of proteins of an HTH DNA contact motif.  C-terminal 270 residues of RbsR are homologous to  ribose-binding protein RbsB.</DOM>
