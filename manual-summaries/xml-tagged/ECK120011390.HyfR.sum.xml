HyfR ,  hydrogenase four regulator,  controls  expression of genes responsible for <RP> proton-translocating formate hydrogenase system and for formate transport</RP> under anaerobiosis, low pH, and post-exponential growth conditions [9387241].
As a <EVF>member of  group of σ54-dependent transcriptional regulators</EVF>, <DOM>HyfR contains three domains:  sensory domain, located in  N terminus;  central domain, involved in open complex formation, ATP hydrolysis, and interaction with σ54, and  C-terminal domain, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding [9387241].</DOM> An iron-sulfur cluster and a metal cofactor (possibly a similar metal or formate) have been proposed as  signals sensed by HyfR [12426353]. 
HyfR <EVPIT>shows 46% identity to FhlA</EVPIT>, a member of  same group. se proteins are dissimilar in ir N-terminal regions, which in FhlA recognizes formate. However, y show only one different residue in ir helix-turn-helix motif, suggesting that y recognize similar DNA-binding sites [9387241].
<TUR><ACTREG> HyfR protein is autoregulated</ACTREG></TUR>. <TUL> gene that codes for it is  11th in  hyf operon, which contains 12 genes</TUL> that are not expressed at significant levels. <TUCREG>This operon is induced under anaerobiosis, at low pH, and under fermentative conditions by formate, and it is subject to catabolite repression</TUCREG> [14702328, 12426353].
