BolA regulates  transcription of genes involved in <RP> morphology of  cell to confer protection to  cell, specifically under stress conditions and during stationary phase [12354237, 19111750]. Its overexpression produces round-shaped cells, alters elongation and cell septation [3053647, 12354237] induces biofilm formation [15345459, 21630090] impairs cell growth rate [21464593], and alters  properties of  outer membrane</RP> [16790025]. Under poor growth conditions, BolA is essential for normal cell morphology during both  exponential and stationary growth phases and in response to sudden carbon starvation [12354237]. 
 transcription expression analysis of some genes with BolA mutants and <DOM> presence of a putative helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding suggest that BolA is a transcriptional regulator,</DOM> although its regulatory mechanism and specific DNA-binding site remain to be determined [2684651]. On  or hand, structural, sequence, and physical interaction analyses show that BolA could be a reductase that interacts with glutaredoxin [15670813].
BolA is a <EVF>member of  BolA family</EVF>, which is widely distributed among proteobacteria and eukaryotes [15670813]. 
 expression of bolA is regulated at  transcriptional level and at posttranscriptional levels.  <TUCREG>Its transcription is induced under stationary phase [1648559]and under different stress conditions, such as carbon starvation, osmotic stress, heat shock, acidic stress, and oxidative stress</TUCREG> [10361282]. On  or hand, bolA mRNA stability during glucose starvation is enhanced in  presence of RNase III function [16309817].
