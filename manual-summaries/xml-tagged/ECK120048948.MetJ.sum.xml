MetJ represses  expression of genes involved in <RP>biosynsis and transport of methionine </RP>[16515535, 1943695].
MetJ <EVF>belongs to  ribbon-helix-helix family of regulatory proteins</EVF>. <DOM> typical motif of members of this family,  ribbon-helix-helix motif for DNA binding, has been observed in  crystalline structure of MetJ [1406951]. This motif is composed of a two-stranded antiparallel β-ribbon that lies along  DNA major groove, two outer α-helices that interact with adjacent proteins along  DNA, and two inner β-helices that form  subunit interface [1406951].</DOM>
<ACTCONF>MetJ as a homodimer [2994061, 1406951] recognizes and binds</ACTCONF> to an <SSA><SSZ>8-bp DNA sequence</SSZ> called  met-box, which varies around a perfect palindromic consensus sequence</SSA> [6094549, 2677754, 3513164]. MetJ finds its target sites rapidly by facilitated diffusion [19289840].  affinity of MetJ to this site is enhanced by S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) [2677754, 7880815] which is  end product of methionine biosynsis and which binds MetJ to act as a corepressor [16622061].  binding of AdoMet to MetJ creates an unusually long-range electrostatic interaction with  phosphodiester backbone of  DNA, raising  DNA affinity by at least 100-fold [8087557, 7862523]. <ACTEFFE>In addition to AdoMet,  metabolites 5'-deoxy-5'-(methylthio)adenosine (MTA) and adenine (Ade) also bind with high affinity to MetJ</ACTEFFE>, but  biological effects of this binding are not known [22890386].
 genes regulated by MetJ contain in ir regulatory region two to five continuous met-boxes [1771231] in which MetJ dimers interact with each or  [2677754, 1406951]. 
<TUR> metJ gene, which is autoregulated</TUR>, is <TUCREG>transcribed divergently from  metBL operon, which is repressed by MetJ</TUCREG> [6094549].
