ZntR,  zinc transport regulator,  regulates a gene involved in <RP> Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) transport systems</RP> [10048032].
<ACTCONDP>In  presence of any of se ions, ZntR activates transcription of zntA</ACTCONDP> by a DNA distortion mechanism that makes  promoter a better substrate for RNA polymerase [10608803, 10048032].  interaction of ZntR with Zn(II) has been characterized [10608803] but its interaction with or ions has not been described. <SSA>An <SSM>inverted repeat sequence</SSM> of <SSZ>22 bp</SSZ>, located in  spacer between  -10 and  -35 boxes, has been identified as  ZntR dimer-binding site</SSA> [10608803, 10048032].

crystal structure of <DOM>an N-terminally truncated fragment of ZntR bound to zinc was solved at a resolution of 19 Ã… [12958362]. Each monomer of ZntR has three domains: a dimerization helix, a signal recognition site and a DNA-binding motif (helix-turn-helix) [10048032, 12958362]. </DOM>Two zinc ions are bound to each monomer [12958362].
ZntR <EVF>belongs to  MerR family</EVF>, and although most members of this family are transcribed divergently from  genes y regulate, <TUL>zntR is distant on  genome from its regulated gene</TUL> [10048032].

ClpXP and Lon proteases degrade ZntR, but  regulator is protected against proteolysis when it is bound to zinc and DNA.  ClpXP protease appears to need an adaptor to carry out proteolysis of ZntR [17220226].
