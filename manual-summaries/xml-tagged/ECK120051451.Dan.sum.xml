DNA-binding protein under anaerobic conditions, Dan [20156994], formerly TtdR or YgiP, <EVF>is an LysR-type transcriptional regulator</EVF> for <RP>L-tartrate fermentation</RP>. Dan <EVF>belongs to  same family of growth phase-specific nucleoid proteins as Fis, Dps, HU, IHF, and H-NS [20156994]. More specifically, Dan belongs to  group II nucleoid proteins, which include Fis, Rob (CbpB), CbpA, and IciA and show irregular distribution within  nucleoid</EVF> [20156994]. Dan may have a functional dichotomy, controlling both  structure and function of  nucleoid [20156994].
<ACTCONDP>In  presence of L- and meso-tartrate, Dan stimulates expression of  divergently transcribed ttdABT operon</ACTCONDP>, encoding <RP>L-tartrate dehydratase and  L-tartrate:succinate antiporter</RP> [19661178, 16804186]. 
 ttd pathway for L-tartate fermentation and  dcu pathway for general C4-dicarboxylate metabolism interact at  regulatory level [19661178].  <TUR>Expression of ttdR (dan gene) is positively autoregulated in response to L-tartrate</TUR> [19661178, 16804186] and <TUCREG>activated by  two-component system DcuSR in  presence of L-tartrate, meso-tartrate, D-malate or fumarate [19661178]. ttdR (dan gene) is repressed by FNR and  nitrate and nitrite two-component systems NarXL and NarPQ</TUCREG> [19661178].
In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay it was shown that Dan binds to  ttdA-ttdR intergenic region [19661178].

Based on genomic SELEX analysis, of a total of 688 Dan-binding sites, 504 were located within intergenic noncoding regions and 184 were within coding regions [20156994].
Dan is a DNA-binding protein with recognition preference for  GTTNATT sequence. This motif suggests a role for Dan in resistance to a metal, as with Dps against iron [20156994]. <DOM>Dan contains two sets of Cys-Cys pairs: one consisting of Cys170 and Cys193, and or of Cys288 and Cys296 [20156994].</DOM>

Dan is highly expressed in cells grown under hypoxic or anaerobic conditions, and it plays a role in local folding of DNA [20156994].
