Lysine Regulator,  LysR, <TUR><ACTREG>is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG></TUR> and coordinately activates transcription of  divergent gene which encodes  enzyme that catalyzes  last step in <RP>lysine biosynsis</RP> [6411928, 6350602, 6350601]. <ACTCONDP>Activation by LysR requires  presence of diaminopimelic acid</ACTCONDP> [6417111]. Stragier et al. have proposed that this compound binds directly with LysR [6411928]. 
LysR <EVF>belongs to  family LysR</EVF>, which <DOM>contains three domains [3413113, 8257110]: an amino-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif; a central domain, with response domains much less conserved, that possibly are important for coinducer-responsive transcription; and a C-terminal domain that includes  key residues possibly involved in DNA interactions and coinducer response [8257110].</DOM>  In systematic studies of oligomerization, it was shown that some members of  LysR family, like LysR, interact with or members of  family to form heterodimers, but  physiological significance of this is unknown [21187915]. 
Although little is known about  mechanism of regulation of  LysR transcription factor, Stragier et al. demonstrated that its regulator acts as an activator by binding to cis-acting elements, <SSM>inverted repeat sequences</SSM> that are not well-conserved, near  promoter [6350601].
