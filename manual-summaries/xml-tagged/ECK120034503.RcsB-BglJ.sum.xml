RcsB-BglJ is a pleiotropic transcriptional activator that coordinates regulation with global regulators, including CRP, LeuO, and HNS. <ACTCONDP>BglJ-RcsB is active independently of RcsB phosphorylation</ACTCONDP> [20952573, 22295907, 24335284]. Regulation by heteromeric transcription factors is a rare event in  bacterial word [24335284]. <SSA>A <SSZ>20-bp consensus sequence</SSZ> motif</SSA> has been proposed for RcsB-BglJ based on analysis with  MEME suite [24335284]. 
RcsB-BglJ acts antagonistically as well as synergistically with additional transcription factors, such as HNS, CRP, and LeuO. Activation by RcsB-BglJ occurs both at non-HNS-repressed promoters as well as at promoters repressed by HNS and/or StpA [24335284].
