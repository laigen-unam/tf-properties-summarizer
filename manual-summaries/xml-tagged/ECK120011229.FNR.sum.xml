FNR is  primary transcriptional regulator that mediates  <RP>transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth  through  regulation of hundreds of genes. Generally, this protein activates genes involved in anaerobic metabolism and represses genes involved in aerobic metabolism [12754220, 15659690]. FNR also regulates  transcription of many genes with or functions, such as acid resistance, chemotaxis, cell structure, and molecular biosynsis</RP>, among ors [12754220, 15659690].
 cellular concentration of FNR is similar under both anaerobic and aerobic growth [15547274], but <ACTREG>its activity is regulated directly by oxygen</ACTREG>. <ACTCONDP>Under anaerobiosis, FNR acquires a [4Fe-4S] cluster that causes a conformational change and dimerization of   protein that causes it to become activated</ACTCONDP> [11581261]. Purification of [4Fe-4S]-FNR in an O2-free environment has been described [19892202].  presence of O2 results in inactivation of FNR via oxidation of this [4Fe-4S] cluster into  [2Fe-2S] cluster [19261852, 15547274, 9177174] and  disassembly of  dimer [8576252]. <ACTCONDN>After prolonged O2 exposure,  [2Fe-2S] cluster is destroyed, and apo-FNR, which lacks an Fe-S cluster, is  primary form of FNR under aerobiosis</ACTCONDN> [18055593, 14730984]. <ACTCONDN>Nitric oxide (NO) is also able to inactivate FNR through  nitrosylation of  [4Fe-4S] cluster</ACTCONDN>, although NO is sensed by or transcription factors, and FNR appears only to function as a final safeguard against NO damage [23471974, 12093725].
Under aerobiosis,  apo-FNR monomer is exposed and can be degraded by  ClpXP protease [16243354]. Two motifs of FNR appear to be necessary for this degradation, one located  in  N-terminal region and  or in  C-terminal region [16243354].
 activated FNR conformation is able to bind <SSA>a specific <SSM>palindromic sequence of DNA</SSM>  with  consensus sequence TTGATNNNNATCAA </SSA>[11771123, 2677602].  G and  first T of each FNR half-site appears to interact with FNR residues Glu-209 and Ser-212 [2136332]. FNR activates  transcription from class I and class II promoters, in which  <SSA>FNR-binding sites are located  around -61, -71, -82, or  -92 in class I  and around -41.5 in class II</SSA> [7592457].  In class I promoters  second N and in class II promoters  third N of  consensus FNR site tend to be an A-T [12706827].
<DOM>During activation, three activating regions (AR) are surface exposed for contact with  polymerase and promote transcription.  AR1 region contacts with  α subunit [10972822],  AR2 region makes contact with  σ70 [12374818], and  AR3 contacts  α NTD of  RNA polymerase [11786011].  group amino acids Thr-118 with Ser-187; Lys-49 with Lys50; and Asp86 and Ile81 with Gly-85 are important for AR1, AR2, and AR3, respectively, to make contact with  RNA polymerase [10972822, 12374818, 11786011].  monomer in  FNR dimer that makes contact with  RNA polymerase and  activating region in FNR that makes  contact depends on  class of promoter, class I or class II [10972822, 12374818, 11786011].
FNR <EVF>belongs to  CRP/FNR superfamily of transcription factors</EVF> whose members are widely distributed in bacteria [14638413].  se proteins have an N-terminal sensory domain, a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain, and a dimerization motif in between [14638413].  sensory domain of FNR contains five cysteine residues, four of which are essential for linking  [4Fe-4S] cluster [8497198].</DOM> 
<TUCREG>Under anaerobic growth conditions, transcription of  fnr gene is negatively autoregulated </TUCREG>[17293415].
FNR was named for  mutant defect in  fumarate and nitrate reduction  [796407].
A new variant of FNR, (FNRD154A)2, was used to identify FNR interactions on  ydfZ promoter region [22326866].  (FNRD154A)2 also recognizes an FNR-dependent promoter under aerobic conditions and maintains its promoter specificity and conformational stability.  This variant was designed with enhanced stability to O2.  It could have a major impact on in vitro verification of  vast numbers of previously unrecognized genes in  FNR regulon, especially in genomic studies [22326866].
