transcription factor NhaR, for  Na+/H+ antiporter Regulator,  is dependent on Na+ and it controls  transcription of  gene involved in  <RP>adaptation to Na+ and alkaline pH [1316901, 8168494, 8144493, 10207920, 9312050, 7823039, 8017942, 7823039] response to adverse conditions [12867437, 11577158]  and biofilm formation</RP> [16997959, 18445167]. 
This regulator <EVF>belongs to  LysR family</EVF>. <DOM>NhaR is composed of two domains:  amino-terminal domain, which contains  DNA-binding region, and  carboxy-terminal domain, which is possibly responsible for inducer binding [3413113].</DOM> In systematic studies of oligomerization, it was shown that some members of  LysR family, like NhaR, interact with or members of  family to form heterodimers, but  physiological significance of this is unknown [21187915].
<SSA> binding targets for NhaR are <SSZ>17 nucleotides long</SSZ></SSA>. Each dimer binds to one of se conserved sequences.  lengths of  degenerate binding sites of NhaR were defined according to  matrix shown for this regulator in  database RegPrecise, which contains matrices generated from alignments of orthologous regions [19884135].
