BglJ is a positive DNA-binding transcriptional regulator of <RP>transport and utilization of  aromatic Î²-glucosides arbutin and salicin</RP>.  
expression of  gene bglJ induces  bglGFB operon  via 
unknown mechanisms. This suggests  possibility that BglJ controls, directly or indirectly,  expression of  bgl operon.  Currently, no experimental binding sites for this regulator have been reported in  literature. 
BglJ is a protein that <EVF>belongs to  LuxR/UhpA family of transcriptional regulators</EVF>. <DOM> It shows a potential helix-turn-helix motif in  carboxyl-terminal domain,</DOM> which <EVPIDT>has 48% identity and 70% similarity to  corresponding domain of  RcsB protein</EVPIDT>.
