transcriptional repressor FliZ controls  transcription of genes involved in  regulation of <RP>curli expression and  motility system </RP> [18765794, 22323519]. During  post-exponential growth phase, this regulator is an abundant protein in  genome, with about 21,500 molecules per cell.
Transcriptome expression analysis showed a global antagonistic effect between FliZ and σS that  resulted in physiological traits, including <RP>flagellum-mediated motility and curli fimbria-mediated adhesion</RP> [18765794, 22323519]. FliZ interferes with binding within σS-dependent promoters, can also discriminate vegetative promoters, and can recognize alternative σS promoter-like sequences [22323519]. 
<DOM> C-terminal domain of FliZ contains an α-helix that is similar to helix 3.0 of σS, and this structure promotes DNA binding [22323519]. In FliZ, this α-helix contains a positively charged amino acid (R108) that is involved in recognition of  extended -10 promoter. This promoter includes a -10 hexamer and different elements located at -14T/-13C, -12T, and -7T [22323519]. Based on mutational analyses, it was shown that  upstream TC constitutes an extended  -10 motif and is recognized by R108 (which recognizes both  14T and 13C), a residue in  α-helix of FliZ.  DNA-binding N-terminal domains of recombinases and various phage integrases also have characteristics similar to  DNA-binding domain of this regulator.</DOM>
FliZ is an inhibitor of curli expression by reducing  expression of MlrA, YdaM, and YciR. FliZ interferes with  activity of σS during  post-exponential phase [18765794].
FliZ and FliY were originally proposed to be cell-density responsive regulators of σF [8550423].
