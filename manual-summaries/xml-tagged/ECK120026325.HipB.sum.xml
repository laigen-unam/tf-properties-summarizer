HipB is  antitoxin of  HipAB toxin-antitoxin system.  
HipAB toxin-antitoxin system <ACTREG>appears to be regulated at  level of HipB stability</ACTREG>.  <DOM>Degradation of HipB is mainly dependent on  Lon protease, and is dependent on an unstructured 16 amino acid domain at  C terminus of  protein [22720069].</DOM>
A bioinformatic analysis revealed that re are a total of <SSA>39 HipB-binding <SSM>palindromic sequences</SSM>, TATCCN(x)GGATA</SSA>, in  promoter regions of 33 genes in  Escherichia coli genome, where N represents any nucleotide and x is  number of nucleotides, from 1 to 30.  functions of se 33 genes are involved in different processes, such as <RP>persistence, metabolism, transcriptional regulation, mismatch repair, membrane proteins, transporter proteins, and inner membrane proteins</RP> [24089053]. 
HipB:  high persistence  [6348026].
