Allose utilization regulator,  AlsR, negatively controls  expression of genes involved in <RP>transport and catabolism of D-allose and low-affinity transport of D-ribose [8576032, 9401019]. <TUR><ACTREG>It is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG></TUR> and coordinately represses transcription of  divergent gene rpiB, encoding an enzyme in  pentose pathway</RP> [8576032]. 
<TUCREG>Synsis of alsR and rpiB genes is induced when Escherichia coli is grown on d-allose in  absence of glucose</TUCREG>. Gene induction occurs when  physiological inducer, d-allose, binds to AlsR, liberating  repression effect caused by this protein [9401019, 10559180].
As a <EVF>member of  RpiR/YebK/YfhH family of transcriptional regulators</EVF>, <DOM>AlsR features an N-terminal domain containing a helix-turn-helix motif [8576032].</DOM> Currently, no DNA-binding sites for this regulator have been reported in  literature.
