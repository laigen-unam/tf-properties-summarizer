MraZ is a transcriptional repressor involved in <RP> control of cell division and cell wall</RP> genes [24659771]. Based on differential gene expression analysis comparing  WT to a mraZ mutant, 100 genes under  control of MraZ were identified [24659771].  analysis showed that three successive TGGGN direct repeats are separated by two consecutive 5-nt spacers [24659771].
MraZ protein is highly conserved in bacteria [15146477, 15362108, 11226588], and MraW is more universal [24659771]. MraZ is similar in both structure and sequence to  DNA-binding transition-state regulator AbrB from Bacillus subtilis [15939023, 16223496]. A preliminary analysis of  crystal structure of MraZ has been published [16511046].
It was previously suggested that MraZ is an inhibitor of  RsmH methyltransferase [20924196], but this report has since been retracted [21196765].
A mraZ null mutation has been generated [12142427]. A mraZ deletion mutant is more sensitive to nalidixic acid and kasugamycin than  wild type [23308060]. 
Based on a comparison of a stationary-phase mraZ null mutant cells and  WT cells, it was shown that 2% of  genes in  genome are differentially regulated. Overproduction of MraZ during  early logarithmic phase showed that 23% of  genes were differentially regulated [24659771].  
MraZ overproduction is lethal and perturbs cell division [24659771].  
MraZ and MraW have antagonistic functions [24659771].
