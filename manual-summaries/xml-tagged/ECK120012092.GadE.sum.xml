transcriptional activator GadE, for  Glutamic acid decarboxylase,  <TUR><ACTREG>is positively autoregulated</ACTREG></TUR> [15489450, 14702398]and controls  transcription of genes involved in <RP> maintenance of pH homeostasis, including  principal acid resistance system [12686161, 11976288, 11555293, 14702398, 12940989, 12399493, 12694615, 12426343] glutamate dependent (GAD), also referred as  GAD system, and genes involved in multidrug efflux</RP>, among ors [12446650, 18808381, 12730179, 16980449, 18297445, 14702398].
GadE also controls  expression of two transcription factors related to acid resistance, GadW and GadX, and for this reason it is considered  central activator of  acid response system [14702398, 12940989]. <TUL>GadE is encoded by  gadE-mdtEF operon</TUL>, <TUCREG>inducible by low pH</TUCREG> [12426343] which is located in  region called  acid fitness island [18808381].
Expression of gadE is controlled by an unusually large 798-bp upstream intergenic region, termed  sensory integration locus [19220752]. At least six regulators related to  acid resistance system, GadE, GadX, GadW, EvgA, YdeO, and MnmE, are involved in  direct regulation of gadE [19220752, 17660422, 14702398].
Ma et al. proposed that <SSA> binding targets for GadE consist of <SSZ>20-nucleotide sequences</SSZ> that possess nonconserved motifs, called  GAD box</SSA>, and suggested that it is a regulator that may form a complex with GadX [12940989]. 
As a <EVF>member of  LysR family</EVF>, <DOM>this transcription factor is composed of two domains:  N-terminal domain, which has a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif in  DNA-binding region, and  C-terminal inducer-binding domain [16218453, 8257110].</DOM>
