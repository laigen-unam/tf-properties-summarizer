Rhamnose regulator,  RhaR, is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in <RP>l-rhamnose degradation</RP> and coregulates with  global transcriptional regulator CRP. se regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of  unusual operon rhaSR, which encodes two transcriptional regulators, <EVPIT>RhaS and RhaR (30% identical)</EVPIT>, both <EVF>members of  AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> and involved in l-rhamnose transport and degradation [16166533, 11073923]. In vitro transcription assays indicate that  Î±-CTD of  RNA polymerase is partially dispensable for RhaR activation and is required for CRP activation of  rhaSR operon [16166533, 11073923].
Apparently, expression of  operons involved in transport and degradation of l-rhamnose first requires expression of RhaR, which induces transcription of  rhaSR operon. In this way, RhaS activates transcription of l-rhamnose gene clusters.
<TUCREG>Transcription of  rhaSR operon is induced when E. coli is grown on l-rhamnose in  absence of glucose</TUCREG>. Gene induction occurs when  physiological inducer, l-rhamnose, binds to RhaR and when cellular cyclic AMP levels are high [16166533, 11073923].
<DOM>This transcription factor is composed of two domains, a C-terminal domain that contains two potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs and an N-terminal domain involved in l-rhamnose binding and dimerization of  protein [15342598, 18366439, 17513476]. </DOM>
<ACTCONDP>In  presence of l-rhamnose, RhaR binds in tandem to two repeat sequences upstream of  rhaS intergenic region to activate transcription</ACTCONDP> by overlapping  -35 box of rhaSp. <SSA> binding targets for RhaR consist of <SSZ>17-nucleotide-long sequences</SSZ> that possess conserved motifs</SSA>; each monomer binds to one of se conserved sequences located on different faces of  DNA [16166533].
