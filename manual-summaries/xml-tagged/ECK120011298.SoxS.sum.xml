SoxS is a dual transcriptional activator and participates in the removal of superoxide and nitric oxide and protection from organic solvents and antibiotics[8955629, 16336183, 19376854, 1400156, 1653416, 8034583, 9324261].
SoxS <EVPIDT><EVPIT>shares 49% identity with MarA</EVPIT> and the N-terminal domain of Rob</EVPIDT> [8383113]. These proteins activate a common set of about 50 target genes [10852879, 12067348, 14712652, 11395452] <TURO>the marA/soxS/rob regulon</TURO>, involved in <RP>antibiotic resistance [8636021, 15853893, 7896685] superoxide resistance [8626315, 1400156, 1317841] and tolerance to organic solvents [9324261, 9783171]and heavy metals</RP> [7793951]. The activity of each protein is induced by different signals: the activity of Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate [11844771, 12791142] and <ACTCONDP>the activities of MarA and SoxS are increased by the aromatic weak acid salicylate [11395452] and oxidative stress [8955629] respectively</ACTCONDP>. SoxS was induced by tellurite (TeO32-) in a DNA microarray analysis  [25049169].
Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated by only one of them. The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites [14594836].
<ACTCONF>SoxS, MarA, and Rob bind as monomers to the same DNA site</ACTCONF>, a <SSA>degenerate <SSZ>20-bp sequence</SSZ> known as the Mar-Sox-Rob box, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the  -35 and  -10 boxes of the promoter</SSA> [10564485, 10564484]. In class I promoters, the activators bind upstream of the  -35 box and are generally oriented in the backward direction, while in class II promoters the proteins overlap the  -35 promoter hexamer and generally are oriented in the forward direction [10564485, 10564484]. As a subset of the class I promoters, the Mar-Sox-Rob box is separated by ~30 bp from the  -10 hexamer but can be functional in either orientation [10564485, 10564484].
The Mar-Sox-Rob box <SSA>contains an  invariant A  at position 1, two recognition elements, the RE1 at position 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18, and a 7-bp A/T-rich spacer separating these elements</SSA> [10802742, 11724537, 11401718]. There are more than 10,000 such binding sites per genome [11866462]. However, the majority of these sites are not functional because they are not in the proper orientation or distance relative to the promoter [11985714]. It was proposed that these proteins bind to their target sites by a mechanism named  DNA scanning  or  prerecruitment.  In prerecruitment, the protein first binds to RNA polymerase in solution, and the binary complex then scans the DNA to find its binding sites [11985714, 11866462]. It has been shown that SoxS binds to the C-terminal domain of the α-subunit of RNA polymerase (α-CTD), in particular, it interacts with amino acid residues lying in or near the DNA-binding determinant of α-CTD. Apparently, SoxS functions as a co-sigma factor and redirects RNA polymerase to promoters carrying a SoxS-binding site [15465042]. 
A new interaction that also occurs via prerecruitment between σ70 R4 of RNA polymerase (RNAP) and SoxS has been identified [20595001]. There is evidence for the existence of two types of interactions between SoxS and σ70 R4, with one type being able to occur  off-DNA  (within a SoxS-RNAP binary complex that scans the chromosome for SoxS-dependent promoters) and with the other one occurring  on-DNA  (within a SoxS-RNAP binary complex residing at a SoxS-dependent promoter) [20595001]. SoxS is now the first example of an Escherichia coli transcriptional activator that uses a single positive control surface to make specific protein-protein contacts with two different subunits of RNAP [20595001]. In class I promoters, the σ70 R4 region binds to the -35 box and SoxS binds upstream of the hexamer, but in class II promoters SoxS binds to the -35 box,  occluding the binding of σ70 R4 [21195716].
SoxS, MarA, and Rob <EVF>belong to the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> [9409145] and, like other members of this family, <DOM>they have two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs for DNA binding: one of them, located in the N-terminal region, interacts with the element RE1 of the Mar-Sox-Rob box, and the HTH located in the C-terminal region interacts with the element RE2 [12217688, 9724717, 11724537].</DOM>
<TUR>soxS is divergently transcribed from soxR</TUR> [1708380]. <TUCREG>SoxR is the transcriptional activator for soxS and a sensor for superoxide and nitric oxide through its [2Fe-2S] center. It activates soxS transcription when oxidized [8816757, 9204707] soxS is regulated only by its intracellular concentration</TUCREG>. Upon removal of the inducer, SoxS is degraded by the Lon protease [15009903]. The binding of SoxS with DNA or RNA polymerase protects it from degradation [16460757].
Transcriptomic and statistical modeling analyses with Zn concentration shifts showed a transient change in the activity of the iron regulator Fur and of the oxidative stress regulator SoxS; these findings suggest a competitive binding mechanism for the physiology of Zn and Fe uptake [22016571].
