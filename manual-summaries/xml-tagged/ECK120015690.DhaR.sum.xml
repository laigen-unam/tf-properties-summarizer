Dihydroxyacetone Regulator,  DhaR, <ACTREG>is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG> and coordinately activates transcription of  divergent Dha operon (dhaKLM), which encodes <RP>three subunits of  dihydroxyacetone (Dha) kinase</RP> [15616579]. 
<ACTCONDN>DhaR is inactivated when DnaK binds to  sensing domain of this regulator</ACTCONDN>, in  absence of Dha [15616579]. Dephosphorylated DhaL (DhaL::ADP) is an antagonist of DhaK and also is able to form complexes with  sensing domain of DhaR. <ACTCONDP>In  presence of Dha, DhaL::ADP displaces DhaK or blocks  association of  DhaK/DhaR complex and DhaR activates  transcription of  Dha operon</ACTCONDP> [15616579]. 
<DOM>DhaR <EVF>belongs to  family of bacterial enhancer-binding proteins</EVF> which contain three domains:  sensing domain located in  N terminus,  central AAA+ domain, and  C-terminal domain, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif involved in  interaction with DNA. Although  C-terminal domain and  N-terminal domain from DhaR are similar to those of or members of this group, its central domain is not [15616579].  central AAA+ domain does not contain  two conserved submotives in this family (ESELF and GAFTGA) responsible for interaction with σ54. As with or members of  family,  possibility exists of that this regulator activates dependent promoters of σ70 instead of dependent promoters of σ54 [15616579].
crystal structure has been determined [24440518]. DhaR regulates transcription by coiled-coil helix rotation, and this provides  mechanism for transmitting  binding signal from  GAF/PAS domains to  C-terminal DNA-binding domain [24440518].</DOM>
