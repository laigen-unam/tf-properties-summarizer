RclR (formerly YkgD) is a redox-sensitive transcriptional activator that <EVF>belongs to  AraC family</EVF>, whose highly conserved cysteine residues are highly specifically sensitive to oxidation by reactive chlorine species (RCS)[24078635].
RclR relies on  reversible oxidation of conserved redox-sensitive cysteine residues to specifically sense RCS and control  expression of <RP>genes essential for survival under reactive chlorine (HOCl) stress </RP>[24078635].

<ACTCONDP>RclR is activated by N-chlorotaurine</ACTCONDP>, and that activation may involve formation of one disulfide bond. <DOM>RclR contains two conserved cysteine residues (Cys-21 and Cys-89) and two conserved histidine residues (His-42 and His-75). Cys-21 and Cys-89 are important in  activation of RclR in vivo. Cys-21 could play  more critical role in  RclR redox response. Oxidation of both cysteines leads to strong, highly specific activation of expression of genes required for survival under RCS stress.  His residues are involved in preventing DNA binding when RclR levels are reduced [24078635].</DOM>
RclR homologs are found in a variety of proteobacteria as well as in a few actinobacteria [24078635].
