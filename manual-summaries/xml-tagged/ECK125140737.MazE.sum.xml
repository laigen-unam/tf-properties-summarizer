MazE is an antitoxin that counteracts  MazF toxin [8226627, 8650219].  MazF exhibits <RP>ribonuclease activity toward single stranded RNA regions of sequence ACA, and  resulting degradation of cellular mRNA causes global  translation inhibition [14580342].  MazF exhibits RNase activity toward tmRNA, and tmRNA is involved in release of MazF-mediated cell growth inhibition [12972253].
mazEF system causes a  programmed cell death response to stresses including starvation [8650219] and antibiotics </RP> [11222603].   antitoxin, <ACTREG>MazE, is subject to degradation by  ClpAP protease complex and exhibits a short (30 minute) half life, whereas  toxin, MazF, is much more stable</ACTREG> [8650219].  Overproduction of MazE has no effect in  absence of MazF [8650219].
Published reports disagree about wher MazF causes cell lysis in  absence of MazE [8650219] or wher  toxin causes reversible inhibition of cell growth, inhibiting translation and replication without causing cell inviability [12123459].   MazE-MazF system mediates  <RP>toxicity of guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate (rapid relA induction), which is associated with amino acid deprivation [8650219]; cell death caused by  antibiotics rifampicin, chloramphenicol, and spectinomycin [11222603]; and  thymineless death (TLD) response to thymine starvation </RP>[12618443].
structure of  MazE-MazF complex is presented at 1.7 A resolution [12718874].   complex is hexameric and is comprised of a MazE homodimer sandwiched between MazF homodimers [12718874].  MazE and MazF comigrate during native gel electrophoresis [8650219].  Protein-protein interactions in  MazE-MazF complex are discussed [12718874, 12810711].  It is proposed that  MazE monomer is less stably folded than  homodimer and that dimerization and associated structural changes may have an important role in protein activity  [12533537].   dimer interface has been structurally characterized [12743116].  <DOM> MazE N terminus is responsible for  DNA binding activity [12810711].   MazE-DNA interaction has been characterized [12533537, 12810711], and  structure of  DNA binding domain is discussed [12743116].</DOM>
Homology and genomic organization of similar antitoxin/toxin systems among bacteria has been reviewed [10943559].  MazE has similarity to episomal PemI [8226627].  Mutations in  N-terminal region of MazE affect its ability to suppress parD mutations in  episomal killer system [9228770].
<TUCREG>Transcription of  mazEF  addiction module  is repressed by high concentrations of guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate</TUCREG> (ppGpp), suggesting that amino acid starvation induces lethality via RelA and  MazE-MazF system [8650219].  <TUCREG>Thymine deprivation also represses mazEF transcription</TUCREG> [12618443].  An autoinhibitory effect on transcription has been observed and an inversion mechanism also contributes to transcriptional regulation [11071896].   lambda RexB protein has an inhibitory effect on ClpP-mediated proteolysis of MazE, increasing survival of lysogenized cells under conditions of amino acid deprivation [9860994].
Dromedary antibodies that recognize MazE have been generated [12533537].
