MlrA is a regulator of <RP>curli production</RP> in an avian pathogenic Escherichia coli strain and in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium [11489123]. Shiga toxin-encoding prophages have been observed to integrate at  mlrA gene of enterohemorrhagic E. coli [11111050].
MlrA is a <EVF>member of  MerR family</EVF>, <DOM>containing  conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain present in members of this family [11489123, 20874755].  On  or hand, its C-terminal domain, probably used by a yet-to-be-identified effector, showed no similarity to any of  hirto-characterized MerR family members [20874755].</DOM>
MlrA binds an <SSA>AAAGTTGTACA(12N)TGCACAATTTT <SSM>palindromic sequence</SSM></SSA> and probably induces DNA underwinding, as in  case of MerR [20874755]. Based on  site identified on  csgDp1 promoter, sites for anor four genes were identified, two of which are transcriptional regulators [20874755]. MlrA is found at a higher level in  hierarchy of  transcription factor network [20874755, 20491932].
<TUR>Expression of  mlrA gene is RpoS-regulated in an avian pathogenic E. coli strain</TUR> [11489123].
MlrA is part of a signaling cascade that controls curli biosynsis, in which c-di-GMP regulates through  diguanylate cyclase/phosphodiesterase (DGC/PDE) pair YegH/YhjH (module I) and  activity of  YdaM/YciR pair (module II), which forms a signaling complex with MlrA. Gmr  functions as a connector and a trigger enzyme in local c-di-GMP signaling; its direct inhibition of YdaM is relieved when it binds and degrades c-di-GMP, allowing <TUCREG>YdaM to activate  transcription factor MlrA</TUCREG> [23708798].
