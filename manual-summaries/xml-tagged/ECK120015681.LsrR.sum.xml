Using particular analysis and high-throughput analysis (microarrays), it was established that LsrR regulates expression of many genes involved in several processes, such as <RP>autoinducer 2 uptake and processing [15743955, 17557827], biofilm architecture [18309357, 17557827], host invasion, stress responses, and foreign DNA, among ors [17557827]. It also regulates  expression of small riboregulators</RP> [17557827].
LrsR pertains to  quorum-sensing system, which involves autoinducer-based bacterial cell-to-cell communication [8288518]. It was demonstrated in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that LsrR directly senses and binds <ACTEFFE> molecule 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), phosphorylated [17274596] and dephosphorylated</ACTEFFE> [17557827]. Distinct forms of DPD constitute  interconverting molecules family generally called autoinducer 2 (AI-2). <ACTCONDN> binding of DPD to LsrR inactivates LsrR, but phosphorylated DPD appears to specifically inactivate  action of LsrR on  expression of genes for autoinducer 2 uptake and processing (lsrACDBFG-tam operon) and lsrR itself</ACTCONDN> [17557827]. On  or hand, it was suggested that dihydroxyacaetone phosphate inhibits binding of DPD to LsrR [15601708].
 structure of  LsrR protein has been analyzed in crystallography and mutational analysis studies, where it was observed that<DOM> it contains two main domains,  DNA-binding domain located in  N terminus and a ligand-binding domain around  C terminus [23589368].</DOM>
This protein binds to DNA as a tetramer to regulate transcription; however, <ACTCONDN>in  presence of phosphorylated autoinducer 2 (AI-2) or ADP-P,  tetramer dissociates into dimers, and  interaction of LsrR with DNA is greatly reduced</ACTCONDN> [23589368].
 structure of LsrR as a tetramer was determined via exclusion chromatography and cross-linking assays [23589368].  crystal structure of  LsrR protein complexed with  native signal (phosphor-Al-2, D5P) was determined [24047255]. D5P is converted into its hydrated form to create strong H-bonds with  carboxyl group of D243 [24047255].
<TUL> lsrR gene is transcribed toger with lsrK in an operon</TUL> [16321939], and this last gene encodes a protein that phosphorylates to DPD [14622426].  <TUCREG> lsrRK operon is transcribed divergently of  lsrACDBFG-tam operon, and both operons are activated by CRP and repressed by LsrR</TUCREG> [16321939].  
lsrR shows differential codon adaptation, resulting in differential translation efficiency signatures, in rmophilic microbes.  It was refore predicted to play a role in  heat shock response.  An lsrR deletion mutant was shown to be more sensitive than wild-type specifically to heat shock, but not or stresses [24580753].
