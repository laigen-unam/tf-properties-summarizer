BaeR has been shown to regulate directly  genes involved in <RP>drug resistance [15716448, 12107134, 12618449, 12951338] and indirectly appears to  regulate genes involved in several cellular processes, such as  flagellum biosynsis, chemotaxis,  and maltose transport</RP> [15716448].
BaeR belongs to  BaeS/BaeR two-component system [8282725, 15522865]. <TUL>Both genes, baeR, encoding  response regulator, and baeS, encoding  sensor kinase, are located  at  end of  operon (mdtABCD-baeSR) regulated by BaeR</TUL> [12107134].  
It has been suggested that BaeS senses envelope disorder [17884222, 12354228] Indole [15686558, 12354228] and zinc [17884222]have been used as inducers of this disorder. BaeR is  primary regulator of  ethanol stress response [24999585]. Leblanc et al. identified <ACTCONDP>two flavonoids and also sodium tungstate as novel inducers to BaeSR</ACTCONDP> [21515766]. se new inducers are natural substrates of  MdtABC efflux pump, and y lead to much stronger induction of  BaeST response in an mdtA efflux pump mutant, while indole does not [21515766]. As a consequence of this sensing, BaeS is autophosphorylated, followed by  <ACTCONF>transfer of   phosphate group to BaeR [8282725] which is converted to an active form</ACTCONF> [12107134] that appears to recognize and bind a <SSM>DNA sequence with a direct repeat symmetry</SSM> [17884222].
BaeR exhibits high degrees of sequence similarity with  transcriptional regulators  OmpR and PhoB  [8282725] and <EVF>belongs to  OmpR subfamily</EVF> <DOM> whose members contain a DNA-binding motif in  C-terminal domain [8282725].</DOM>  BaeSR, PhoBR, and CreBC two-component systems have been shown to interact in  regulation of gene expression [15716448]. BaeR suppresses envZ and phoR/creC mutations [8282725].
 crystal structure of  unphosphorylated dimeric form of BaeR has been determined [23868292].
BaeR:  bacterial adaptive response, response-regulator   [8282725].
