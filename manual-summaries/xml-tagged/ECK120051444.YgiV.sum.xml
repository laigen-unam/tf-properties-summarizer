YgiV had been predicted as a transcriptional regulator [9278503, 19376874]. However, based on nickel enrichment DNA microarrays and additional gel shift assays, it was identified as a transcriptional repressor of mcbR, which regulates <RP>biofilm formation and mucoidity</RP> by repressing expression of mcbA (ybiM) [18309357].
MqsR has a toxic effect on Escherichia coli bacterial growth, which is partially reduced by  ygiV mutation [18309357].
