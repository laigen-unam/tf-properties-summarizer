RutR regulates genes directly or indirectly involved in <RP> complex pathway of pyrimidine metabolism [16540542, 17919280]and also plays a role in regulation of  genes for degradation of purines and genes for maintenance of pH homeostasis</RP> [17919280].
This protein <EVF>belongs to  TetR family</EVF>, <DOM>whose members have an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that contains a helix-turn-helix motif and a C-terminal domain for dimerization and ligand binding [15944459].</DOM>

RutR recognizes and binds a <SSA><SSZ>16-bp (7-2-7) <SSM>inverted repeat consensus sequence</SSM></SSZ> [17919280, 18515344] where  central A/T nucleotide in each half-site appears to be  most important for  site</SSA> [18515344]. <ACTCONDN>This binding is inhibited when uracil and thymine bind to RutR</ACTCONDN>, although  effect is greater for uracil than for thymine [17919280].
It has been demonstrated, in E. coli as in or bacteria,  that RutR binds to several coding regions located hundreds of base pairs downstream of  start codon. However, no role in transcriptional regulation of this binding has been observed [18515344].
<TUR> rutR gene, which is autorepressed [17919280] is transcribed divergently from  RutR-regulated rutABCDEFG operon</TUR> [16540542].

RutR:  pyrimidine utilization, rut repressor  [16540542].
