YpdB <EVF>belongs to  LytTR response regulator (RR) of  two-component system [12034833]that participates in  carbon control network</EVF> and may participate in nutrient scavenging before entry into stationary phase [23222720]. <DOM>It is composed of an N-terminal CheY-like receiver domain and a C-terminal LytTR-like effector domain with DNA-binding affinity [23222720].</DOM>
YpdB binds to <SSA><SSM>two direct repeats</SSM> of  motif GGCATTTCAT, separated by an 11-bp spacer</SSA>, in  yhjX promoter [23222720].
Based on genome scanning and microarray analysis, it has been determined that yhjX is  sole target gene regulated by  YpdA/YpdB system, and it is modulated by  sequence-dependent structure of  surrounding DNA [23222720].
Based on microarray analyses of Escherichia coli, 2,3-butanedione (2,3-BD) and glyoxylic acid (GA), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from Bacillus subtilis, mediated global changes in gene expression related to motility and antibiotic resistance phenotypes that affected  expression of more than 100 genes [23651997]. se changes were mediated by YpdB through  regulation of  transcription factors SoxS, YjhU, and  RpoS sigma factor, which were increased by treatment with (2,3-BD) [23651997]. 
YpdB is required for biofilm formation, and it is induced by VOCs [16000817, 23651997].
 expression of hipA was severely reduced in  ypdB knockout, which suggests that  ypdB gene product might function as an upstream activator or transcription factor for hipA expression [23651997]. 
<TURO> YpdA/YpdB two-component system</TURO> is widespread among proteobacteria and show a high degree of conservation in gammaproteobacteria [23203871].
 YpdA/YpdB system stimulates expression of  yjiY gene,  target of  YehU/YehT system, which suggests an interconnectivity between  two systems [24659770]. <ACTCONDP>YpdA/YpdB is activated during growth in an amino acid-rich milieu, such as LB medium</ACTCONDP>. <ACTREG>It responds to extracellular pyruvate</ACTREG> [24659770].
YehU/YehT and YpdA/YpdB two-component systems are activated and expression of  corresponding target genes was found to occur at  same time as  onset of  stationary phase [24659770].
In vivo studies detected crosswise stimulus-dependent alterations in  expression of ir respective target genes, and mutational analyses revealed that deletion of any of  components of  signal transduction cascade affects  function of  or. On  or hand, in vivo protein-protein interaction assays suggested that both systems toger form a single large signaling unit [24659770].
Activation of  YehU/YehT signaling cascade, which results in YjiY production, suppresses YpdA/YpdB-mediated yhjX induction, whereas activation of  YpdA/YpdB signaling cascade, as well as inducing  synsis of YhjX, promotes expression of yjiY [24659770].
