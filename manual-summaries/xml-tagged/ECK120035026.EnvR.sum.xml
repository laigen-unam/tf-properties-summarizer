EnvR, also known as AcrS, represses  transcription of genes encoding <RP>a drug efflux pump that has a role in resistance to antibiotics </RP>[18567659].
This protein is homologous to some or proteins, such as MtrR of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, TcmR of Streptomyces glaucescens, JadR2 from Streptomyces venezuelae, and AcrR from Escherichia coli [7592375, 8196548]. <DOM>All of se proteins, including EnvR,  have a helix-turn-helix motif  close to  N terminus [7592375, 8196548].</DOM>
EnvR recognizes and binds a <SSA><SSZ>24-bp</SSZ> <SSM>palindromic DNA sequence</SSM></SSA> [18567659].  same sequence is also recognized by  transcriptional repressor AcrR [18567659].
<TUL>envR is adjacent and divergent in  genome to acrEF</TUL>, an operon that encodes anor drug efflux pump; however, <TUR>it is not regulated or is only lightly affected  by EnvR</TUR> [18567659]. <TUCREG>Both of se transcription units appears to be repressed by HNS</TUCREG> [18567659].
