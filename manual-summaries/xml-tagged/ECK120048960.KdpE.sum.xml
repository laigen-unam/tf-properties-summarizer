KdpE is a transcriptional regulator involved in  regulation of genes involved in <RP>a high-affinity potassium (K+) uptake system </RP>[17536175, 11931551, 7855422].  genes of this system and ir regulators are widely distributed among  gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and archaea [17536175]. KdpE activates expression of  kdpFABC operon encoding  P-type ATPase KdpFABC, a high-affinity potassium transport system. 
KdpE <EVF>belongs to  two-component system KdpD/KdpE</EVF> [1532388]. <TUL> operon containing both genes, kdpE, encoding  response regulator, and kdpD, encoding  sensor kinase, is located next to and in  same direction as an operon (kdpFABC) regulated by KdpE</TUL> [1532387]. It has been suggested that sometimes  genes of  two operons are transcribed in only one transcript [1532387]. In some species  arrangement of se genes in  genome is different than in Escherichia coli [17536175]. 
KdpD exhibits both kinase and phosphatase activities towards KdpE [9099740, 11123681, 9651326]. Under K+-limiting conditions or under osmotic stress imposed by a salt, autophosphorylation of KdpD at His-673 is stimulated [17536175, 11016946, 8223625]. Subsequently, <DOM><ACTREG> phosphate group is transferred from KdpD to Asp-52 of KdpE [8437514, 1630317, 9099740] leading to  dimerization and activation of KdpE</ACTREG> [16322582].</DOM> At high concentrations of K+,  kinase activity of KdpD is inhibited [11016946].
<ACTREG>Under salt stress,  universal stress protein UspC binds to KdpE and stabilizes  KdpD-KdpE-DNA complex</ACTREG>; refore, this system can be activated even though K+ accumulates under this environmental condition [19101563]. In addition, expression of  kdpFABC operon is regulated by  phosphoryl group transfer chain Ntr-PTS: dephosphorylated enzyme IIANtr binds to KdpD, and this interaction strongly stimulates KdpD kinase activity [19400808].
KdpE is a<EVF> member of  OmpR/PhoB subfamily of response regulators</EVF> [1532388, 1970651] and binds a <SSZ>23-bp recognition sequence</SSZ> [1630316].  crystal structure of KdpE with and without bound beryllium fluoride has been solved [16322582].
Overproduction of KdpE causes a drug resistance phenotype [12618449].
