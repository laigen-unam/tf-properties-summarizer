Gluconate repressor, GntR, is a transcription factor that negatively regulates  operon involved in <RP> catabolism of d-gluconate via  Entner-Doudoroff pathway and also represses genes involved in two different systems related to d-gluconate uptake: gluconate I and gluconate II</RP> [11115104, 14593252, 12618441, 9658018]. 
<TUL>This regulator is part of  gntRKU operon</TUL>, yet it can also be constitutively expressed as an independent ARRAY(0x156d848) transcription unit [9135111, 8655507]. Gluconate I is considered  main system for transport of d-gluconate and contains genes that encode high- and low-affinity gluconate transporters [11115104, 9045817, 9871335, 9358057, 9537375]. 
d-gluconate II system is capable of transport of l-idonate and also is regulated by IdnR;  genes involved in this system encode anor high-affinity gluconate transporter [11115104, 14593252, 12618441, 9658018]. In addition,  genes regulated are induced when Escherichia coli is grown in  presence of  inductor, d-gloconate, and in  absence of glucose. <ACTCONDP>In  absence of inductor, this repressor <SSA>binds in tandem to <SSM>inverted repeat sequences</SSM> that consist of <SSZ>20-nucleotide-long DNA target sites</SSZ> </SSA></ACTCONDP>[11115104]. 
<ACTCONDN>Binding of GntR to DNA is diminished in  presence of  inducer d-gluconate</ACTCONDN>. GntR is closely homologous to IdnR ARRAY(0x15c3fc0) and <EVF>belongs to  LacI/GalR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> [11115104, 8655507, 9135111]. 
<DOM>Accordingly, this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: a conserved N-terminal domain which contains  DNA-binding region, and  carboxy-terminal domain, which is involved in effector binding and oligomerization [9135111].</DOM>
