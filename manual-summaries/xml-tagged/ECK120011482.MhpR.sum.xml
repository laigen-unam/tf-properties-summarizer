MhpR,  hydroxyphenylpropionate regulator,  participates in controlling  expression of several genes involved in <RP>degradation of phenylpropionate (PP)</RP> [9098055, 12748194]. <ACTCONDP>MhpR is able to bind to its DNA-binding site even in  absence of inducer; however, increasing concentrations of inducer improve  binding strength of MhpR</ACTCONDP>. 3-(2,3-Dihydroxyphenyl)propionate (DHPP) and 3-hydroxyphenylpropionate (3HPP), two intermediates of  metabolic pathways, are  principal inducers of MhpR.  third inducer, phenylpropionate (PP), acts synergistically with DHPP and 3HPP [12748194, 19520845]. 
This protein, which <EVF>belongs to  IclR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF>, <DOM>has a helix-turn-helix motif to bind DNA in its N-terminal domain and a 22-residue motif, <EVF>specific to an IclR subfamily</EVF>, in its C-terminal domain [9098055].</DOM>
MhpR is necessary to recruit CRP to  regulatory region of  mhp operon, where both proteins activate transcription [12748194].
<TUL> mhpR gene, which is located downstream of  genes it regulates and in  opposite direction</TUL>, <TUR>appears to be expressed constitutively</TUR> [12748194].
