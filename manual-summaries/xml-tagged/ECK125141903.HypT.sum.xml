HypT <EVF>belongs to  LysR-type transcriptional regulator family</EVF>, which <RP>protects cells from HOCl damage [22223481, 24116067]. It regulates several genes upon hypochlorite stress, which increases cellular viability by reducing  intracellular iron levels [22223481]. This assumes a primary role for HypT in downregulating iron acquisition genes in order to prevent furr synsis of iron uptake proteins</RP> [22223481].
<ACTREG>HypT is specifically activated by HOCl by methionine oxidation</ACTREG>, protecting  cells from  detrimental effects of HOCl) [22223481]. HypT <EVF>belongs to  large family of LTTRs</EVF> and is conserved in α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria and eukaryotes (Xenopus tropicalis), which suggests conservation of  HOCl response in evolution and its maintenance throughout  kingdoms [22223481].
Based on microarray analysis, <ACTCONDP>HypT upregulates genes involved in <RP>cysteine and methionine biosynsis and sulfur metabolism upon hypochlorite stress. On  or hand, genes involved in iron acquisition and homeostasis upon hypochlorite stress are downregulated by YjiE </RP></ACTCONDP> [22223481].
<DOM>HypT has five cysteine residues which contribute to control  DNA-binding activity of HypT in vitro [24116067]. Cys150 is required for stability, Cys4 is important for oligomerization of HypT to dodecamers, and Cys4 oxidation may be a checkpoint in  activation process of HypT [24116067].</DOM>
 building block of HypT is likely a dimer; similar to or LTTRs, it forms unusually large oligomers, as dodecameric ring-like structures, in vitro that undergo large DNA-induced conformational changes to form dimers and tetramers [22223481]. Studies based on  dynamic oligomers showed that oxidized small HypT oligomers (tetramers) are  activation-competent species, whereas  docameric ring-like structures are  storage form [24275662].
<ACTCONDP>In  presence of hypochlorite, <DOM>HypT becomes active due to oxidation of three methionines (Met123, Met206, and Met230).</DOM></ACTCONDP> A probable conformational change upon oxidation allows  protein to bind DNA to regulate transcription. <ACTCONDN>Oxidation of HypT is reversed by  presence of  methionine sulfoxide reductases MsrA and MsrB, resulting in an inactive protein</ACTCONDN> [23690622].
