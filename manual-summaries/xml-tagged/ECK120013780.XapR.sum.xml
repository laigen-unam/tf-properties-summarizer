XapR,  xanthosine phosphorylase regulator,  activates transcription of genes involved in <RP>xanthosine metabolism</RP> <ACTCONDP>when xanthosine is present [10400599, 7559336]. Deoxyinosine can also induce XapR activity</ACTCONDP>, although not to  same extent as xanthosine [10400599].
XapR, which <EVF>belongs to  LysR family</EVF>, <DOM>has a DNA-binding site in  N-terminal domain [2201776] and a signal-recognition site separated in two regions in  amino acid sequence. In  three-dimensional structure of an XapR homolog (CysB from Klebsiella aerogenes), se two regions appear close to each or, forming one signal-binding site.</DOM> <EVPIT>XapR is homologous to AlsR; y show 68% of identity in an amino-terminal region of 60 amino acids</EVPIT> [10400599].
<TUL> xapR gene is located downstream of  genes it regulates and in  same direction</TUL>, but in an independent transcription unit that appears to be expressed constitutively [7559336].
