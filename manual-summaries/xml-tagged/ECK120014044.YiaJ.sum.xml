YiaJ is a transcriptional repressor that negatively controls  expression of genes involved in <RP> catabolism of  rare pentose l-lyxose</RP> [10913096, 9525947, 15870475].
<TUR><ACTREG>YiaJ is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG></TUR>, and coordinately represses transcription of  divergent yiaK-S operon, related to degradation of l-lyxose [10913096]. Additionally, its operon is activated by insertion of IS1 into  yiaJ gene [9525947]. Although little is known about  mechanism of regulation of  YiaJ regulator, recently it has been demonstrated to act as a repressor by binding to cis-acting elements that overlap yiaKp [10913096].  
YiaJ <EVF>shows high homology to  IclR family of regulators</EVF>; <DOM>it is composed of two domains, an amino-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a carboxy-terminal region featuring a second motif of unknown function [9525947].</DOM>
