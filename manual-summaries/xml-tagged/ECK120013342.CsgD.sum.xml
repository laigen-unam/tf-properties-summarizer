protein CsgD, for  Curlin subunit gene D,  is a transcriptional regulator [8817489] that regulates a number of genes involved in <RP> Curli assembly, transport, and structural components [9383186, 8817489] which are important for biofilm formation [14523117]. In addition, it also regulates genes related to cell surface-associated structures</RP> [14523117, 18599830, 16513732]. It may also have  capability to respond to starvation and high cell density [14523117] and positively controls σS expression [16600914, 17873038]. In general  environmental conditions, such as low osmolarity, low growth temperature (@@lt@@32°C), and low growth, affect  expression of csgD and  production of  biofilm and cellulose [18599830, 11717281, 8173808].
Since csgD is induced during  mid-exponential phase of growth and  CsgD-dependent activation of csg genes is detected in  stationary phase, it has been suggested that <ACTREG>CsgD is posttranscriptionally activated in  stationary phase</ACTREG>  [14523117].
CsgD might activate transcription through two different mechanisms, as suggested by  different locations of its binding sites in  regulatory regions of  genes it activates. In one regulatory region,  protein binds to a single site, whereas it binds to <SSA>two sites arranged as <SSM>inverted repeats</SSM></SSA> in anor region [14523117]. 
<DOM>CsgD <EVF>belongs to  FixJ/LuxR/UhpA family</EVF>, which is characterized by a C-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a receiver domain in  N-terminal region [8218244].</DOM>
<ACTREG>Five different small RNAs are known to regulate expression of CsgD at  post-transcriptional level</ACTREG>; reviewed in [22414234]; a sixth has recently been discovered [24489123].
