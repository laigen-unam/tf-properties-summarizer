MarA,  multiple antibiotic resistance  [8383113] participates in controlling several genes involved in <RP>resistance to antibiotics, oxidative stress [10498949] organic solvents [9324261, 10498949, 9097440] and heavy metals</RP> [10498949].
<EVPIT>MarA, SoxS, and Rob are paralogous transcriptional regulators that show  45%  amino acid identity between them</EVPIT> [8383113]  the crystal structures for Rob [10802742]and MarA [9724717]confirm this similarity between them. They activate a common set of  genes,  but the expression and activity of each one of these proteins are induced by different signals: the activity of  Rob is increased with dipyridyl, bile salts, or decanoate [11844771, 12791142], and  <ACTCONDP>the transcription of MarA and SoxS is increased by the aromatic weak acid  salicylate [11985714]and oxidative stress [8955629] respectively</ACTCONDP>.
Many genes are regulated by all three proteins; however, some genes are regulated only by one of them.  The differential regulation of these genes might be caused by the degeneracy of their DNA-binding sites [14594836].
These three monomer proteins bind to the same DNA site, <SSA>a degenerate <SSZ>19-bp sequence</SSZ> known as <TURO>the sox-mar-rob box</TURO>, which has to be in a specific orientation and distance  relative to the -35 and -10 boxes of the promoter</SSA> [10564485, 10564484].  In class I promoters, the activators bind upstream of the -35 box and are generally oriented in a backwards direction, while in class II promoters the proteins overlap the -35 promoter hexamer and generally are oriented in the forward direction [10564485, 10564484]. In a subset of the class I promoters the sox-mar-rob box is separated by ~30 bp from the -10 hexamer but can be functional in either orientation [10564485, 10564484].
For MarA it was shown that the extent of activation at different promoters is only poorly correlated with the strength of MarA binding to the specific mar box [18514222]. By using a computational model of transcriptional activation it was proposed that at the class I promoter of mar MarA increases the binding of RNA polymerase but not the occupancy. At the class II promoters of sodA and micF MarA can even decrease both RNA polymerase affinity and occupancy at the promoter. The model predicts that MarA increases the rate of transcription initiation while decreasing the overall presence of the transcription machinery at the promoter [20019803].
<SSA>The sox-mar-rob box contains an  invariant A  at position 1,  two recognition elements, the RE1 at postion 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18, and a 7-bp  A/T-rich spacer separating these elements</SSA> [10802742, 11724537, 11401718]. There are more than 10,000 such binding sites per genome [11866462]. However, the majority of these sites are not functional because they are not in the proper orientation or distance relative to the promoter [11985714]. Based on these findings, it was proposed that these proteins activate the transcription by a mechanism named  DNA scanning  or  prerecruitment,  which consists of the formation of the complex  RNA polymerase transcriptional regulator in the absence of DNA, and then this complex scans the DNA to bind to appropriate sites [11985714, 11866462].
These three proteins <EVF>belong to the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> [9409145]  and as with other members of this family <DOM> they have two helix-turn-helix  (HTH) motifs for DNA binding, one of them, located in the N-terminal region, interacts with the element RE1 of the mar box, and the HTH located in the C-terminal region interacts with the element RE2 [12217688, 9724717, 11724537].</DOM> In the case of Rob, it appears that only one of two HTH motifs makes base-specific contact with DNA; this was observed for the micF promoter [10802742].
Cells carrying a MarA mutation in a glutamic acid residue (E89A) were able to express higher resistance to superoxides than those harboring wild-type MarA [21097628]. Thus, MarA E89A acts more like SoxS than MarA in exhibiting greater activation and binding at the class I promoter [21097628].
<TUL>marA is the second gene of the marRAB operoN</TUL>, which <TUR>encodes an autorepressor (MarR) and an autoactivator (MarA)</TUR> [8383113].  <TUCREG>MarR is inactivated by salicylate</TUCREG>, and then the operon is induced. Upon removal of the inducer (salicylate), MarA is degraded  by the Lon protease [15009903]  and the binding of MarA with DNA or RNA polymerase protects it from degradation  [16556231].
The adaptability and plasticity of a regulatory network were determined by using an in vivo system that was developed to identify variants of helix-turn-helix transcription for the MarA transcriptional regulator [22496663].
