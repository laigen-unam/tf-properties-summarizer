Cold shock protein A,  CspA, is a major cold shock protein and was shown to be detected only during early-log-phase growth at 37°C and during log phase after a shift from 37°C to 10°C [3553157, 2404279]. However, studies have shown that although  expression of cspA is reduced during stationary phase, cspA mRNA and CspA are detectable during all growth phases [22093878]. 
CspA acts as a positive transcription factor of at least two <RP>cold shock</RP> genes: hns [7748932, 1961761, 11278076]and gyrA [1325964] cspA has been shown to <TUR>negatively regulate its own expression</TUR> as  result of attenuation of transcription [9371456]. A model of how CspA might affect  transcription of hns has been proposed [17088256]. CspE inhibits  expression of cspA in vitro by increasing pause recognition by RNA polymerase at  cspA  cold box  [10200963].
CspA <EVF>belongs to  cold shock family of proteins</EVF> and was shown to be homologous to eukaryotic Y-box transcription factors [9484881, 3174636].  transcription factors of this family <SSA>recognize a CCAAT sequence</SSA> in  regulatory region of  genes regulated [11278076, 7748932].
 crystal structure of CspA has been determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.0 Å [8197194] also,  structure of CspA has been determined by NMR spectroscopy [7515185, 9692981].  
On or hand, Jiang et al. in 1997 demonstrated that CspA acts as an <RP>RNA chaperone</RP> that prevents secondary structure formation of RNA at low temperatures [8995247, 9371456] cspA mRNA is very unstable at 37°C and rapidly disappears as  cell density and RNase activity increase [1597410, 10075935]. 
 lability of cspA mRNA at high temperatures is mediated by cleavage toward its 3' end; this cleavage is partially dependent on RNase E [17416651]. Thus, cspA expression levels change in response to temperature fluctuations [23815967].  long 5' untranslated region of cspA mRNA contains a feature within  first 25 bases that is responsible for derepression of cspA expression and inhibition of synsis of cellular proteins or than cold shock proteins following cold shock [8759856]. cspA was also shown to be induced by addition of chloramphenicol and was induced even in  absence of protein synsis [8376329, 10074075].
By making use of micro arrays analysis, Constantinidou et al [16377617] concluded that <TUCREG>FNR represses cspA gene expression</TUCREG>, but it is not know which of  two promoters (cspAp1, cspA2) is affected. y also identified a putative FNR binding site upstream of  gene, but  sequence was not shown.
