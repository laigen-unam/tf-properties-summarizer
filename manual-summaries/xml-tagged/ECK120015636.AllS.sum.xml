AllS,  allantoin , transcriptional activator participates in controlling genes involved in <RP> utilization of allantoin</RP> as a nitrogen source. <ACTEFFE><ACTCONDP>Although AllS binding does not depend on  presence of allantoin, this compound appears to be necessary for activation</ACTCONDP>, perhaps by interacting with AllS</ACTEFFE> [12460564].
AllS <EVF>belongs to  LysR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF>, and <DOM>like or members of this family, it has a putative helix-turn-helix motif in  N-terminal domain [12460564].</DOM>
<TUCREG>Expression of  allS gene is negligible under aerobic conditions and is increased under anaerobic conditions in  presence of glyoxylate or allantoin. In  absence of its repressor, AllR, allS is expressed under nitrogen-limiting growth conditions, but its induction is independent of  regulators Nac and NtrC, which are active under se conditions</TUCREG> [12460564].
