ComR is a <EVF>member of  TetR family of transcriptional repressors</EVF> and has been implicated in  <RP> response of E. coli K-12 to copper</RP>. 
In in vitro experiments, ComR binds to a 60 bp promotor region upstream of  comC gene [22089859] but <ACTCONDN>is released in  presence of copper, silver or gold.</ACTCONDN> Expression of comC is dramatically increased (approx 270 fold) in a comR negative strain upon exposure to 3mM copper. comR knockout mutants have lower cytoplasmic copper levels compared to  wild type when exposed to copper [22089859]. <TUCREG>Expression of comR is not affected by copper</TUCREG> [22089859].
