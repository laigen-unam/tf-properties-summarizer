AppY,  acid phosphatase,  transcriptional regulator induces  expression of <RP>energy metabolism</RP> genes <TUCREG>under anaerobiosis, stationary phase, and phosphate starvation. Under se same conditions,  expression of  appY gene is induced</TUCREG> [8626281, 9079897].  genes regulated by AppY have promoters that are recognized by both σ70 and σ38; <ACTCONDP>AppY activates ir transcription when any of se σ factors is bound to  RNA polymerase</ACTCONDP> [9079897].  specific AppY binding site has not yet been identified.
When AppY is overproduced,  expression of 30 proteins is induced or repressed in a growth phase-dependent fashion. Overproduction of AppY also causes an elevated spontaneous mutation rate. refore, it is possible that this protein regulates genes involved in <RP>DNA replication, recombination, or repair</RP> [15225322].
AppY, which <EVF>belongs to  AraC/XylS family</EVF>, <DOM>has a C-terminal DNA-binding domain that shows a helix-turn-helix motif [2537825, 8451183].</DOM>  proteins with greatest similarity to AppY are CfaD of enterotoxigenic  Escherichia coli and VirF of Shigella flexneri [8451183].
