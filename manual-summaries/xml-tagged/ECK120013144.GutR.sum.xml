glucitol repressor,  GutR, is a DNA-binding transcription factor that represses an operon (gut) involved in <RP>transport and utilization of glucitol</RP> [3062173, 3036766]. <TUL>This regulator is located in  unusual gut operon</TUL>, which contains two glucitol-specific transcription factors, GutR and GutM, <TUR>that regulate this operon negatively and positively</TUR>, respectively; both regulators control transcription of glucitol PTS permease [3062173].
<TUCREG>Expression of gutR is activated in  presence of glucitol and in  absence of glucose</TUCREG>. Although DNA binding by GutM does not depend on  presence of glucitol, this compound appears to be necessary for derepressing gutM, perhaps by interacting with GutR [3062173]. 
In addition, Yamada et al. suggested that se regulators have contrary effects, but in  presence of glucitol, GutR interacts with this carbohydrate to dissociate from DNA, causing increments of GutM in sufficient amounts to increase transcription of  gut operon [3062173]. To repress transcription, GutR recognizes DNA-binding sites, but no consensus sequence has been identified. When this protein represses genes involved in glucitol transport and utilization, it appears to bind to ir regulatory regions without a coeffector [3062173].
This regulator <EVF>belongs to  DeoR family of repressors</EVF>. <DOM>GutR is composed of two domains:  amino-terminal domain, which contains  DNA-binding region, and  carboxy-terminal domain, which is responsible for dimerization and inducer binding [3062173].</DOM>
