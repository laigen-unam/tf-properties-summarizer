AdiY is a positive DNA-binding transcriptional regulator that controls <RP> arginine decarboxylase (adi) system</RP>, which is strongly induced in rich medium, under anaerobic conditions, and at low pH [8704970, 7537138].
Several proteins are involved in  induction of  adi system. Changes in  external pH activate  adiA gene. AdiY may function directly or indirectly with CysB to increase expression of adiA. IHF and H-NS might modulate  bending and necessary access of  adiAp promoter for activation [8704970]. It has also been proposed that AdiY is not  only regulator of  adi system, but  conditions under which AdiY functions remain unknown [12867448].
 amino acid sequence of AdiY shows homology to <EVF>members of  XylS/AraC family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> [8704970, 7537138].<DOM>  C-terminal region of proteins from this family features a helix-turn-helix motif. AdiY has a putative transmembrane region, suggesting that it may be a membrane-associated protein [8704970].</DOM>
<TUL> gene adiY is located downstream of adiA and in  same orientation</TUL> [8704970].  lack of an evident transcription-termination structure in  intergenic region between adiY and adiC, separated by 137 bp, suggests  possibility of both genes being part of  same operon [8704970] but furr studies have failed to confirm this [12867448].
