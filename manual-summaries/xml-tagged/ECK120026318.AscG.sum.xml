AscG,  Arbutin-salicin-cellibiose,  transcriptional regulator represses  expression of a cryptic operon (ascFB) whose genes are involved in <RP>transport and utilization of  Î²-glucoside sugars arbutin, salicin, and cellibiose</RP>. This operon is activated only when  repressor <ACTCONDN>is inactivated through  interruption of  gene by an insertion sequence</ACTCONDN> [1630307]. AscG also regulates prpBC for propionate catabolism [19633077]. 
AscG is a GalR-type transcription factor and <DOM>has a helix-turn-helix motif [1630307, 19633077].</DOM> AscG recognizes and binds  consensus palindromic sequence TGAAACCGGTTTCA [19633077].
ascG gene is transcribed divergently from  operon it regulates [1630307] ascG is paralogous to galR [19633077]. A high level of AscG is always present in wild-type Escherichia coli cells [19633077].
