phenylacetic acid  regulator [9748275]  PaaX,  is a transcriptional repressor that participates in controlling transcriptional regulation of genes involved in <RP> catabolism of an aromatic compound, phenylacetic acid (PA)</RP> [10766858]. When PaaX is overexpressed, it causes elevated levels of mutations in  genome; refore, it is a candidate to regulate DNA replication, recombination, or repair [15225322]. 
<DOM>PaaX <EVF>contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding that is similar to  motif found in  N terminal of members of  GntR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> [9748275]. Members of this family share similar N-terminal DNA-binding domains but are classified into four subfamilies according to ir divergence in ir C-terminal domains, which are involved in effector binding and oligomerization [11756427].</DOM>
Homology with PaaX has been found in or bacteria, such as Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus halodurans, and  Arthrobacter sp., among ors [10766858].
majority of work concerning PaaX has been done in E. coli W, in which has been found  DNA-binding sites for PaaX, including a site upstream of  paaXY operon [15159386]. <SSA> DNA-binding consensus of PaaX consists of a <SSM>palindromic sequence of 6 bp</SSM> separated by about 27 bp</SSA> [15159386, 16788190]. This palindromic property of  PaaX site as well as  presence of a helix-turn helix motif in  protein have been  basis for suggestions that PaaX binds DNA as a dimer [10766858, 15159386].
binding of PaaX to DNA <ACTCONDN>is inhibited by phenylacetyl-CoA</ACTCONDN>, which is  product of  first catabolic step in PA degradation [10766858, 9748275].
<TUL>paaX is transcribed in an operon (paaXY) that is located in  genome downstream and in  same orientation as  paaABCDEFGHIJK operon</TUL>, <TUCREG>which is repressed by PaaX</TUCREG> [10766858].
Crystal structures of  transcriptional repressor PaaX have been determined [22102047].
