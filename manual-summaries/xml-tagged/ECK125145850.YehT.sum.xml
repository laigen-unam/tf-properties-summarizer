YehT <EVF>belongs to  LytTR response regulator (RR) of  two-component system</EVF> that is involved in <RP> stationary-phase control network</RP> [12034833, 22685278].
An exhaustive search of  Escherichia coli genome found a single motif for  YehT transcriptional regulator, located upstream of  yjiY gene; refore, it seems to be  only target regulated by  YehU/YehT system [22685278].
Overproduction of YehT is associated with <RP>moderate resistance to growth-inhibiting agents, such as crystal violet and deoxycholate</RP> [12618449].
YehT protects three repeats of  motif upstream of  yjiY gene, which have been designated M1 to M3 and were identified using  MEME tool.  YehT-binding site consists of <SSA><SSM>two direct repeats</SSM> of  sequence motif ACC[G/A]CT[C/T]A, and se are linked by a 13-bp spacer</SSA> [22685278]. 
An adenine nucleotide in front of M1 and hence M2 seems to be part of  DNA-binding motif. Both  M3 motif and  intervening spacer could be stabilizers for  YehT:DNA complex [22685278].
 YehU/YehT two-component system is one of  most widespread in bacteria and is also found in several human and plant pathogens [22685278]. <ACTREG>It is activated in response to  presence of peptides or amino acids</ACTREG> [22685278]. YehU/YehT has a negative effect on expression of  yhjX gene of  YpdA/YpdB system, which suggests an interconnectivity between  two systems [24659770].
 YehU/YehT and YpdA/YpdB two-component systems are activated and expression of  corresponding target genes was found to occur at  same time as  onset of  stationary phase [24659770].
In vivo studies detected crosswise stimulus-dependent alterations in  expression of ir respective target genes, and mutational analyses revealed that deletion of any of  components of  signal transduction cascade affects  function of  or. On  or hand, in vivo protein-protein interaction assays suggest that both systems toger form a single large signaling unit [24659770].
Activation of  YehU/YehT signaling cascade, which results in YjiY production, suppresses YpdA/YpdB-mediated yhjX induction, whereas activation of  YpdA/YpdB signaling cascade, as well as inducing  synsis of YhjX, promotes expression of yjiY [24659770].
