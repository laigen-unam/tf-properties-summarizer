glucitol regulator,  GutM, is a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates an operon (gut) involved in <RP>transport and utilization of glucitol</RP> [3062173, 3036766]. <TUL>This regulator is located in  unusual gut operon</TUL>, which contains two glucitol-specific transcription factors, <TUR>GutR and GutM, that regulate this operon negatively and positively</TUR>, respectively; both regulators control transcription of glucitol PTS permease [3062173]. 
<TUCREG>Expression of gutM is increased in  presence of glucitol and in  absence of glucose</TUCREG>. Although GutM binding does not depend on  presence of glucitol, this compound appears to be necessary for derepressing gutM, perhaps by interacting with GutR [3062173]. 
To activate transcription, GutM recognizes DNA-binding sites, but no consensus sequence has been identified. When this protein activates genes involved in glucitol transport and utilization, it appears to bind to ir regulatory regions without a coeffector [3062173]. In addition, Yamada et al. suggested that  regulators GutM and GutR have contrary effects; <ACTCONDP>in  absence of glucitol, GutR represses transcription of  gut operon</ACTCONDP>, and <ACTCONDN>in  presence of glucitol, GutR interacts with this carbohydrate to dissociate from DNA</ACTCONDN>, causing increases of GutM in sufficient amounts to increase transcription of  gut operon [3062173].
