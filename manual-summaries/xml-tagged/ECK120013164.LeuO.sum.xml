LeuO is a dual transcriptional regulator that regulates genes involved in <RP>leucine biosynsis [15582999, 6987127], genes involved in  utilization of certain Î²-glucosides [9422614, 16207917] and genes encoding LuxR-type transcription factors [18055596]. It is also involved in  bacterial stringent response</RP> [11376008].
LeuO is one of  transcription factors that counteracts H-NS-mediated repression of specific loci [15582999, 16207917, 9422614, 21883529, 22804842]. Overproduction of LeuO causes  phenotype Bgl+, since LeuO can unsilence  bglGFB operon, which is silenced (phenotypically Bgl ) under laboratory conditions [9422614].
LeuO is part of  RpoS/H-NS/Hfq/LeuO/DsrA RNA regulatory cascade that controls  bglGFH operon [16207917]and translation of rpoS, particularly at low temperatures [9302018, 14594834].
LeuO <EVF>belongs to  LysR transcriptional regulator family</EVF> and <DOM>contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain [9422614, 3413113].</DOM> No LeuO consensus binding sequence is known [18055596].
LeuO activates transcription of  divergent leuLABCD operon [11121424].
An in vivo genetic selection (SELEX) and phenotype microarray analysis revealed several <RP>multidrug resistance genes as targets for LeuO, including acrEF, ygcLKJIH-ygbTF, and mdtNOP (sdsRQP). mdtNOP (sdsRQP) is involved in sensitivity control against sulfa drugs [19429622].
A total of 140 genes were found to be under LeuO control, based on genomic SELEX screening; 133 of se genes are related to  stress response, pathogenesis expression, and fimbrial genes for biofilm formation</RP> and are under  control of an antagonistic interplay between LeuO and H-NS [21883529]. On  or hand, 1,094 predicted sites for LeuO were identified using  position-specific scoring matrix method [22804842].
