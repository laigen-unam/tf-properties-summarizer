transcription factor CsiR, for  Carbon starvation induced Regulator,  is a finely modulate repressor that controls  transcription of genes involved in <RP> degradation and transport of 4-aminobutyrate</RP> for utilization as a source of nitrogen [14731280, 12446648, 374339, 24037]. 
<ACTCONDP>CsiR is expressed upon carbon starvation</ACTCONDP> and has a repressor effect during   stationary phase [14731280].
Currently, no DNA-binding sites for this regulator have been reported in  literature [14731280].
