Zur,  zinc uptake regulator,  regulates genes involved in <RP> Zn2+ ABC transporter uptake system and genes involved in  expression of alternative ribosomal proteins</RP> [9680209, 10816566, 12904577]. 
<ACTCONF> active conformation of Zur is observed when it is in a reduced form and when it is bound to Zn(II)</ACTCONF>.  oxidized form of Zur does not bind to DNA or zinc [9680209, 10816566, 11931550]. <ACTREG>Zur is not autoregulated</ACTREG> [11931550].
Zur, which <EVF>belongs to  Fur family</EVF> [9680209], <DOM>appears to have a DNA-binding site in  N-terminal domain, around residue 65, and a signal-recognition site in  C-terminal domain. This protein has two Zn(II)-binding sites: site A, which only binds to Zn(II), and site B ( sensor site), which binds to Zn(II) and Co(II) with high and low affinities, respectively [11523983].</DOM> Zur is able to form dimers, even in  absence of zinc [10816566].
 <SSA><SSZ>23-bp <SSM>palindrome consensus sequence</SSM></SSZ> for Zur-binding sites</SSA> of gamma-proteobacteria, including Escherichia coli, has been determined by computational analysis [12904577].
