β-d-glucuronides repressor,  UidR, is a transcriptional repressor. <TUR><ACTREG>UidR negatively regulates its own synsis</ACTREG></TUR> and represses transcription of  uid operon, which is involved in <RP>transport and degradation of β-glucosides [3934044, 3079718, 6353163, 6276362, 776934]. This regulator is involved in  degradation of sugar acids</RP> and is subject to catabolic repression in  presence of glucose and at low levels of cyclic AMP.
Although little is known about  regulating mechanism of UidR, it has been shown to act as a repressor, <SSA>binding to a putative <SSM>inverted repeat sequence</SSM></SSA> in a cooperative process with UxuR [6553163, 3079718, 2823062]. In 1986, Blanco et al. proposed that total <ACTCONDN>repression of UidR is achieved in  presence of UxuR</ACTCONDN>, suggesting  possibility that UidR and UxuR form a complex. Independently, each repressor binds to DNA separately [3079718, 3889544, 2823062].
