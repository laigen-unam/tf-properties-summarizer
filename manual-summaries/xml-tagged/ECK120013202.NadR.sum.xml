multifunctional protein NadR has enzymatic as well as regulatory activity.  Initially thought to only function as a transcriptional regulator that represses genes involved in <RP>transport and de novo synsis of NAD [4349027, 16078372], NadR was later shown to have nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) adenylyltransferase activity [10464228] and predicted to have ribosylnicotinamide kinase activity</RP> [12446641].  
<DOM>NadR is composed of three different domains: an N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain for DNA binding, a central NMN adenylyltransferase domain that contains an ATP-binding site, and a C-terminal ribosylnicotinamide kinase domain [12446641].  NadR is often found to be mutated in long-term evolution experiments; interestingly, mutations are usually only found in  N- and C-terminal domains [18029306].</DOM>
It has been proposed that NadR recognizes and binds to <SSA><SSZ><SSM>two palindromic sequences</SSM> of 6 bp</SSZ> separated by six less conserved nucleotides</SSA>.  This site is conserved in some NadR ortholog target genes in some enterobacteria, and it was also identified upstream of  nadR gene itself in E. carotovora, S. marcescens, Y. pestis, and Y. enterocolitica , but not in Escherichia coli [16078372].
