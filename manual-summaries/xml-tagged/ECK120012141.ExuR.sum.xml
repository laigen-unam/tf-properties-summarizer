Exuronate repressor, ExuR, is a DNA-binding transcription factor <TUR><ACTREG>that negatively regulates its own synsis</ACTREG></TUR> and represses transcription of  operons involved in <RP>transport and catabolism of galacturonate and glucuronate</RP> [6808145, 11115104, 6450743, 7007313, 7026975, 783117]. On  or hand, ExuR is similar to UxuR ARRAY(0x1602fd8) , and apparently both act toger and are capable of cross-talk to regulate expression of  uxu operon [11115104, 7007313, 6353163, 3929016]. For this reason, re is  possibility that se regulators bind  same sites with different affinities.
Currently, no DNA-binding sites for this regulator have been reported in  literature, and although little is known about  regulating mechanism of ExuR, it has been shown to act as a repressor that binds to a putative inverted repeat sequence [11115104]. Comparative analysis of intergenic DNA sequences showed  consistent occurrence of ExuR possible binding sites upstream of  genes related to  transport of gluconate ARRAY(0x1603a20) and with  transport and degradation of glucuronides ARRAY(0x1603b28) [11115104].
