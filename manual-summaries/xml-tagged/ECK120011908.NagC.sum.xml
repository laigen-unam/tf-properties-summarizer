NagC,  N-acetylglucosamine,  transcriptional dual regulator participates in regulating <RP> phosphotransferase system (PTS) [18067539]. Its function is to coordinate  biosynsis of  amino sugars, D-glucosamine (GlcN) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) with ir catabolism</RP> [1766379, 11361067, 11139621, 15066032].
<ACTEFFE> specific inducer for NagC is GlcNAc-6-P</ACTEFFE>,  product of GlcNAc transport by  PTS [1766379, 11361067]. NagC is displaced from its DNA targets by interacting with GlcNAc-6-P [1766379].
Based on  structure of Mlc DNA-binding transcriptional repressor, models for  three-dimensional structure of NagC and for  binding of GlcNAc-6-P were developed [18067539].
Nag regulon consists of two divergent operons, nagE and nagBACD. nagC encodes  repressor of this regulon. <TUL>Its localization within  inducible nagBACD operon is unusual, since most transcriptional dual regulators are located near  loci y control</TUL> [1766379].
NagC is present at low levels within  bacterial cell [1766379].
consensus sequence for  NagC-binding site has been determined via combination of native site comparisons, operator mutagenesis, and selection of DNA-binding fragments, [11139621].  dual function of NagC requires it to bind simultaneously to two operators in order to form a DNA loop [11361067]. <SSA> strictly conserved TT/AA motif, located in both ends of  center of symmetry, is probably  major recognition point for NagC</SSA> [11139621].
NagC is a <EVF>member of  ROK (repressor, ORFs, kinases) (NagC/XylR) family of proteins</EVF>, which contains at least two distinct classes of proteins, xylose repressor (XylR) and a series of glucose/fructose kinases [7952186, 12374829]. 
NagC is similar to Mlc transcriptional dual regulator [15916829]. However, y have different specificities for select binding sites [11139621].
<DOM>NagC has a helix-turn-helix motif in its N-terminal part [18067539].</DOM>
