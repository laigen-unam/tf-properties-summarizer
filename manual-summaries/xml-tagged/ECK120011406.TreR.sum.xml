Trehalose repressor,  TreR, acts as a repressor of operons involved in <RP>trehalose transport and degradation</RP> under osmotic stress [8391102, 1651549]. <ACTCONDN>In  presence of trehalose-6-phosphate and at low osmolarity levels, TreR derepresses an operon</ACTCONDN> related to trehalose transport and catabolism [9148912, 2160944, 8083158, 7608078, 19787122] while trehalose is inactive [19787122].
TreR occurs as a homodimer and <DOM>is composed of two domains: an amino-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, and a carboxy-terminal domain involved in effector recognition [9148912].</DOM> This transcription factor is a regulator that <EVF>belongs to  LacI/GalR family (specifically, to  HutC subfamily)</EVF> [12598694, 9865945]. <SSA>This regulator binds to a <SSZ>14-bp-long <SSM>palindromic sequence</SSM></SSZ></SSA> [7608078, 9148912].
 crystal structure of  trehalose repressor (TreR) in a complex with its inducer trehalose-6-phosphate has been published [9865945].
Based on saturation transfer difference NMR, it was shown that both trehalose-6-phosphate and trehalose bind to TreR with similar affinities. Titration showed that trehalose-6-phosphate binds more strongly than trehalose [19787122].
 ratio of dissociation of TreR [koff(trehalose)]/[koff(trehalose/6-phosphate)] is  >/-2,800, and its rate of association (kon) is >/-102 [19787122].
