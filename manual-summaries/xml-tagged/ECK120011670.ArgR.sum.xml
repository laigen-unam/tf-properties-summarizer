ArgR complexed with L-arginine represses  transcription of several genes involved in <RP>biosynsis and transport of arginine, transport  of histidine, and its own synsis [17074904, 3116542, 1640456] and activates genes for arginine catabolism [12003934]. ArgR is also essential for a site-specific recombination reaction that resolves plasmid ColE1 multimers to monomers and is necessary for plasmid stability</RP> [3149585].  role of ArgR in this latter reaction may be structural [3149585]. <ACTCONF> hexamer is  active form of ArgR</ACTCONF>, and <ACTEFFE>L-arginine binds to ArgR and stabilizes  hexamer</ACTEFFE> [8594204] and increases its DNA affinity by allosteric activation [8594204, 15663926].
ArgR <EVF>belongs to  ArgR/AhrC family</EVF>, whose members are widely distributed in bacteria [11305941].  DNA sequence which  proteins of  family recognize and to which y bind are also well-conserved among genomes [11305941].  <SSA>This DNA sequence consists of  a <SSM>palindromic <SSZ>sequence of 18 bp</SSZ></SSM>,  called  ARG box</SSA> [11305941, 1640456]. An ArgR hexamer binds to a pair of se boxes that are generally separated by 3 bp [1640456, 1640457].   repressor can bind to a single box but with a greatly reduced affinity [1640456, 1640457].  ARG box generally overlaps  promoter sequence and  transcriptional start site [1640456] refore, it was suggested that it represses  transcription by steric exclusion of RNA polymerase binding [17850814].
<DOM>ArgR has two domains:  N-terminal domain, which contains a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif [9334747]  and  C-terminal domain, which contains a motif that binds L-arginine and a motif for oligomerization [8594204]. Based on cross-linking analysis of wild-type and mutant ArgR proteins, it has been shown that  C-terminus is more important in cer/Xer site-specific recombination than in DNA binding [20659168].</DOM>
