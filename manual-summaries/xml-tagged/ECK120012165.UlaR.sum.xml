UlaR is a DNA-binding transcription factor of 251 amino acids that is <TUR>expressed constitutively</TUR> and that coordinately represses transcription of a divergent operon (ula) involved in <RP>transport and utilization of L-ascorbate catabolism [12644495, 12374842, 17906139, 15153772]. Synsis of se genes is induced when Escherichia coli is grown in  absence of glucose, and under anaerobic conditions it can ferment L-ascorbate</RP>; <ACTCONDP>under aerobic conditions it is functional in  presence of casein acid hydrolysate</ACTCONDP> [14996803, 11741871, 17906139]. 
<ACTEFFE>L-Ascorbate-6-P is  effector of  UlaR transcriptional repressor</ACTEFFE>, and when this small molecule binds to UlaR, it severely impairs  formation of UlaR cognate operator sites, since y form a stable complex [18844374]. L-Ascorbate-6-P weakens  affinity of UlaR for DNA and displaces  UlaR oligomer state from a transcription-silencing tetrameric form to a transcription-activating dimeric form [18844374]. <ACTREG>UlaR activity is also controlled by homotypic tetramer-dimer transitions regulated by L-ascorbate-6-P</ACTREG> [18844374]. 
UlaR <SSA>binds to four <SSM>inverted repeat motifs</SSM></SSA> in  divergent intergenic region ulaG-ulaA and overlaps its target promoters to repress transcription by blocking  interaction of  RNA polymerase with ulaGp and ulaAp [14996803]. Here,  presence of L-ascorbate-6-P breaks this configuration down into DNA-free UlaR homodimers and allows transcription to proceed [18844374]. At concentrations of >2 nM, L-ascorbate-6-P displaces UlaR from its operator site [18844374].
In this system  full repression of  ula regulon requires IHF and binding of UlaR to four operator sites, possibly involving UlaR-mediated DNA loop formation [14996803]. 
 UlaR transcriptional repressor <EVF>belongs to  DeoR family</EVF>, and accordingly, <DOM>this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: an N-terminal HTH domain (residues 1-62), which contains  DNA-binding region [12374842] and  C-terminal sugar-phosphate-binding domain (residues 69-251), which is responsible for dimerization and inducer binding [16376935].  C-terminal sugar-phosphate-binding domain belongs to  DeoR-C family of  ISOCOT superfamily and is structurally related to E. coli D-ribose-5-P isomerase [16376935]. Asp206 and Lys209 are directly involved in binding L-ascorbate-6-P [18844374].</DOM>
