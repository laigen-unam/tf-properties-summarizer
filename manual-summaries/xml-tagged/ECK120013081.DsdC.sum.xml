<ACTCONDP>In  presence of d-serine,   D-serine deaminase  protein, DsdC, activates  transcription of genes</ACTCONDP> involved in <RP>d-serine detoxification</RP>, and in  <TUR>absence of  metabolite it is autorepressed</TUR> [6296057].
DsbC  <EVF>belongs to  LysR family of bacterial transcriptional regulators</EVF> and <DOM>contains a possible helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding  in  C-terminal domain.</DOM> <EVPIT>This protein shows 50% similarity to  GcvA protein</EVPIT> [7592420, 3275618].
<TUL> dsbC gene is located next to an operon ( dsdXA ) regulated by DsbC</TUL>, but facing in  opposite direction. <ACTEFFE> activation effect of DsdC on this operon is enhanced by CRP</ACTEFFE>, but CRP cannot act alone on  operon [7592420].
A DNA-binding site recognized by  dimer of DsbC has not been identified.
