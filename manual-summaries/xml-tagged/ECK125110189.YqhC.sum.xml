YqhC transcriptional activator directly binds to  promoter region of  yqhD gene, which <SSA>contains  SoxS-like binding sequence as well as a <SSZ>24-bp <SSM>palindrome</SSM></SSZ></SSA> [20543070]. YqhC also regulates dkgA expression [20676725].  yqhD and dkgA genes encode <RP>NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases, and both are involved in furfural reduction</RP> [20676725].
YqhC <EVF>belongs to  AraC/XylS transcriptional activator family</EVF>, as <EVPIT>it shows 13.6% amino acid identity with AraC</EVPIT> [20543070, 20676725].  identity of  intracellular signal for YqhC is yet to be discovered [20543070].
Closely related bacteria contain yqhC, yqhD, and dkgA orthologs in  same arrangement as in Escherichia coli LY180. On  or hand, orthologs of yqhC are also present in more distantly related Gram-negative bacteria [20676725].
<ACTREG>It is probable that YqhC regulates its own expression</ACTREG>, since it is inducible by furfural [19429550, 20676725]. 
Diverse aldehydes induce  yqhC-dependent expression of yqhD and dkgA genes [20676725]. However, <ACTREG>it is probable that YqhC does not interact directly with inducers but responds to a physiological effect of aldehydes</ACTREG> [20676725].
