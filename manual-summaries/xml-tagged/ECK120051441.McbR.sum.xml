McbR <EVF>belongs to  group of DNA-binding proteins of  GntR/FadR family of bacterial regulators</EVF> [11756427, 19729089]. <DOM>It binds as a dimer to its operator site via its winged helix domains [11279025].</DOM> It is probable that McbR binds DNA as a dimer [20713450].  
McbR (YncC) regulates <RP>biofilm formation and mucoidity</RP> by repressing expression of mcbA (ybiM) [18309357]. McbA belongs to  YhcN family of periplasmic proteins and is induced by  quorum-sensing signal autoinducer 2 (AI-2) [11514505, 9588799].
McbR is <ACTREG><TUR>negatively autoregulated</TUR> and, in addition, repressed by YgiV</ACTREG> [18309357]. 
<TUCREG>Expression of mcbR is induced by overexpression of  lsr operon regulators LsrR and LsrK</TUCREG>,  quorum-sensing regulator MqsR, and  AI-2 exporter TqsA [18309357].
<DOM>McbR carries a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (aa 37-56)</DOM> and represses transcription of mcbA by binding to  promoter region of mcbA [18309357].
McbR: MqsR-controlled colanic acid and biofilm Regulator [18309357].
