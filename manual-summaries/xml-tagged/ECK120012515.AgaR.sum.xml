N-acetylgalactosamine repressor,  AgaR, negatively controls  expression of  aga gene cluster, which is involved in <RP>transport and catabolism of N-acetylgalactosamine and d-galactosamine</RP> [14731281, 10931310]. It <TUR><ACTREG>is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG></TUR> and coordinately represses transcription of  divergent agaZVWEFA operon, which is related to transport and degradation of N-acetylgalactosamine [14731281]. <ACTREG>This repressor responds to N-acetylgalactosamine and d-galactosamine in  medium</ACTREG>.
As a <EVF>member of  DeoR/GlpR family</EVF> of transcriptional regulators [14731281]. <DOM>AgaR features an N-terminal domain containing a helix-turn-helix motif and a C-terminal domain that includes  key residues involved in co-inducer recognition and oligomerization [14731281].</DOM> In accordance with or helix-turn-helix DNA-binding repressors, <ACTCONF>AgaR may bind to DNA as a tetramer</ACTCONF>. 
AgaR binds in tandem to several repeat sequences in  intergenic regions of agaZp, agaRp, and agaSp to repress transcription by overlapping  -35 and -10 boxes. <SSA> binding targets for AgaR consist of <SSZ>24-nucleotide-long repeat sequences</SSZ> that possess conserved motifs</SSA> [14731281].
agaR:  N-acetylglactosamine degradation  [8932697].
