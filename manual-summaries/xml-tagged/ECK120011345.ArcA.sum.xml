ArcA is a dual transcriptional regulator for Anoxic redox control [2964639, 8412675, 7855430]. <ACTCONDP>It acts primarily as a negative transcriptional regulator under anaerobic conditions</ACTCONDP>. ArcA represses operons involved in <RP>respiratory metabolism, including those that encode products such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt, and enzymes of the pathway for fatty acid degradation [2070418, 7855430, 1812811]. In addition, ArcA acts as a repressor for rpoS transcription [16291649]. ArcA also activates a few operons encoding proteins involved in fermentative metabolism</RP> [8071220, 8892825]. It has been identified as global repressor of carbon oxidation pathways [24146625]. Microarray analyses have identified a large number of genes affected by ArcA and have revealed that the Arc system and the FNR regulatory network overlap to a much greater extent than previously estimated [15699038, 14711822, 15838044]. It has been suggested that <ACTCONDP>the most significant role of ArcA is under microaerobic conditions</ACTCONDP>, while that of FNR is under more strictly anaerobic conditions [12486057, 15669087]. For full expression of arcA both FNR and ArcA are required [8022271]. Distinct functional roles for both regulators have been proposed, and it has been shown that there is little direct coregulation of the two [24146625].
ArcA is a response regulator and <ACTCONF>is activated as a DNA-binding protein by phosphorylation</ACTCONF> [11527965]. The cognate sensor kinase ArcB is membrane associated and has three cytoplasmic domains; a transmitter, a receiver, and a phosphotransfer (HPt) domain [7957084, 1597416]. <DOM>Under anaerobic conditions ArcA is phosphorylated in a phosphorelay reaction that involves phosphotransfer from the autophosphorylated transmitter domain of ArcB to the receiver and Hpt domain of ArcB and finally to the receiver domain of ArcA [10851007, 8825099, 9286997].</DOM> Autophosphorylation of ArcB is stimulated by effectors such as d-lactate, pyruvate, and acetate [10585483, 10585483]. Under aerobic conditions, the autokinase activity of ArcB is inhibited by quinone electron carriers [11423658, 15326287] and unphosphorylated ArcB promotes the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P by a reverse phosphorelay reaction [9830034, 15838055]. It has been suggested that ArcA may also be subject to cross-regulation by other, unknown sensor kinases [16291649, 12366850, 17213678].
<EVF>ArcA is a member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of response regulators</EVF> and <DOM>consists of an N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain  [9205844].</DOM> The crystal structures of the receiver domain of ArcA in the presence and absence of the phosphoryl analog BeF3- have been solved [15876365]. In the crystal structures, the receiver domain forms a symmetric dimer.
Weight matrices for the DNA-binding site for ArcA-P have been obtained. <SSA>The proposed binding site consists of <SSZ>15 bp</SSZ> with a <SSM>direct spaced repeat</SSM> </SSA>[15728117, 10216875]. It has been suggested that <ACTCONF>multimerization, induced by phosphorylation, is a prerequisite for binding</ACTCONF> [11527965]. ArcA represses transcription by directly binding to the promoter or by binding to sites overlapping an activator-binding site [16849788, 15252051]. As an activator, it  appears to act as part of a nucleoprotein complex. For activation of pfl, a functional interaction between the ArcA and Fnr protein has been suggested [1592804]. For expression of cydAB, it has been shown that ArcA-P antagonizes H-NS [11123679]. At the R1 PY promoter, ArcA acts in conjunction with TraJ. ArcA represses and activates transcription solely by binding DNA, and it activates only indirectly when its binding interferes with the binding and repression of another transcriptional repressor [24146625]. The majority of ArcA-binding sites overlap the Ïƒ70 promoter recognition elements [24146625].
Under glucose-abundant conditions, the double mutant of   iclR arcA causes an increase in biomass yield (47%) and reduction of acetate (70%) and CO2 (16%) production. Under glucose-limited conditions, this double mutant exhibits an increase of biomass of only 13% [21481254]. On the other hand, in an arcA mutant, the TCA cycle flux was increased 4.4 times above that of the wild type in the presence of nitrates, and the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio increased approximately 2-fold above that of the wild-type strain [22790675].
An exhaustive analysis of the ArcA response regulator was carried out, based on different experimental methodologies, High-throughputs (ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq), bioinformatic analysis, DNase I footprinting, and gene expression profiling, and the results showed that ArcA is a global repressor of carbon oxidation pathways [24146625]. ArcA-P directly regulates the expression of 85 operons under anaerobic growth conditions, where 74 operons are repressed and 11 are activated [24146625]. It was shown that most ArcA-binding sites contain additional direct repeat (DR) elements as well as the two required for binding an ArcA dimer, and this finding provided a  novel insight into how ArcA accomplish global regulation of gene expression [24146625]. More than 50% of the sites have additional DR elements, and the majority of ArcA-binding sites contain three to five DR elements, predominantly at a CTC spacing of 11 bp [24146625]. The variations in the number, spacing, location, and predicted strength of DR elements within the chromosomal ArcA-binding regions suggest plasticity in the architecture of ArcA-binding sites for either repressed or activated operons [24146625].
