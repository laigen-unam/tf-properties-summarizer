Glycine cleavage A,  GcvA, is a repressor of <RP> glycine cleavage enzyme system</RP>, which is a secondary pathway for production of C1 units [8188587]. <ACTREG>It is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG>, and it coordinately activates transcription of a small-RNA divergent gene [7665470, 10972807].
<ACTCONDP>In  absence of glycine and  presence of GcvR, GcvA represses operons</ACTCONDP> involved in  glycine cleavage system [7665470, 10972807, 11495998]. GcvR is an accessory protein that binds directly to GcvA, bending DNA to form a repression complex (GcvA/GcvR) in  regulatory region of  gcvT operon [11495998]. 
Glycine binds directly to GcvR to disrupt or block  association of  GcvA/GcvR complex, whereas purines appear to promote  formation of  repression complex through an unknown mechanism [12101307, 11495998]. GcvA also activates transcription of  gcv genes, via interaction with  α or σ subunits of RNA polymerase [15621456].
This transcriptional dual regulator, which <EVF>belongs to  LysR-family</EVF> [8188587]<DOM> has two domains:  amino-terminal domain, which appears to be involved in transcription activation and in DNA binding through its helix-turn-helix subdomain, and  carboxy-terminal domain, involved in GcvR interaction [9733689, 11495998].</DOM>
GcvA binding sites do not show a clear conservation in ir sequences except for a <SSA>short 5'-CTAAT-3' region</SSA> [7665470].
