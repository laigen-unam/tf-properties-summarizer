PuuR is a transcription repressor that regulates transcription of several genes and operons involved in <RP>putrescine utilization and transport </RP>[15590624, 22522900]. Transcription of puuA was induced in a puuR deletion mutant [18495664].
<DOM>This regulator is comprised of two domains:  carboxy-terminal domain, which is similar to cupin superfamily proteins, and  amino-terminal domain, which has high similarity to regulators of  HTH-XRE family [22522900].</DOM>
Nemoto et al. showed that this regulator binds to four target sites in  divergent region located between  operons puuA and puuDR. Its regulator represses transcription by overlapping  promoters puuAp and puuDp, and  binding targets for PuuR consist of <SSA><SSZ>15 nucleotides</SSZ>, with  following recognition sequence: AAAATATAATGAACA</SSA> [22522900].
transcription of  puu genes occurs when putrescine interacts with PuuR; this effect changes  conformation of PuuR, and its regulator dissociates from  binding sites. When  level of putrescine decreases in  cell, PuuR can repress  transcription of puu genes [22522900].
