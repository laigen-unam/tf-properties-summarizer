LldR, formerly named  lactate regulator , is a transcription factor that controls expression of genes involved in <RP>transport and catabolism of L-lactate</RP> [18263722, 8407843]. This regulator has a dual function and <TUR><ACTREG>is positively and negatively autoregulated</ACTREG></TUR>. <ACTCONDP>In  absence of L-lactate and under anaerobic conditions, this regulator repressed  transcription of  lldPRD operon</ACTCONDP> [18263722]. In this repression system, LldR binds to two operators and probably leads to repressor DNA looping [18263722]. <ACTCONDP>Expression of this regulator is also stimulated in presence of L-lactate</ACTCONDP>, and this inductor promotes a conformational change that probably destabilizes  DNA loop, promoting  transcription open complex [18263722].
On  anor hand, <TUCREG> transcription of lldR is also induced upon biofilm formation compared to planktonic growth in both exponential and stationary phases</TUCREG>. An lctR mutant is impaired in biofilm formation [14731270]. 
LldR is a protein that <EVF>belongs to  GntR family</EVF> and, accordingly, <DOM>this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains: a conserved N-terminal domain which contains  DNA-binding region, and  carboxy-terminal domain, which is involved in effector binding and oligomerization [8407843].</DOM>
