transcription factor ModE, for  Molybdenum,  is  principal regulator that controls  transcription of operons involved in <RP>  transport of molybdenum and synsis of molybdoenzymes and molybdate-related functions, among ors </RP> [8564363, 8931336, 8550508, 9210473, 10446207, 10206709, 9851041, 11092866, 12029041, 16205910].  <ACTCONDP> regulatory effect of ModE is induced when E. coli is grown under anaerobic growth conditions and when  physiological inducer, molybdenum, binds to ModE</ACTCONDP> and promotes  dimerization of  ModE-Mo complex [10446207, 10206709, 9210473, 12583917].   ModE dimer binds two molecules of molybdenum with a Kd of 0.8 mM.  Tungsten can act as a substitute for Mo in ModE binding to  modABCD promoter in vitro, but  complex may be biologically inactive [11092866].
binding targets for ModE consist of <SSA><SSM>inverted repeat sequences</SSM> that possess conserved motifs</SSA>; each monomer binds to one of se conserved sequences [14641908, 10446207, 9210473, 10206709]. 
A crystal structure of ModE has been solved at 2.1Ã… resolution [10075916].
<DOM> monomer of this transcription factor contains two domains:  N-terminal domain is responsible for binding DNA and  dimerization and also contains a winged helix-turn-helix motif [10075916].   C-terminal domain is indispensable for molybdate binding and possibly is involved in  DNA binding [11259434, 8931336, 10075916, 12581638].</DOM>  Tentatively, this transcription factor is classified as a <EVF>member of  LysR family</EVF> [9210473]. 
A microarray analysis for ModE of E. coli was done by [16205910].
