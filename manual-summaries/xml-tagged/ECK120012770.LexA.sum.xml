LexA represses  transcription of  several genes involved in <RP> cellular response to DNA damage or inhibition of DNA replication [2994755, 10760155] as well as its own synsis [6990417]. This regulation is known as  SOS response</RP> [2994755].
When DNA is damaged,  RecA coprotease binds to  single-stranded DNA in  damaged region to form a filament [18497818, 17364684]. This filament interacts with  LexA dimer to activate its self-cleavage activity by an allosteric mechanism, causing  dissociation of LexA from its DNA targets and  induction of  SOS regulon for  repair of broken DNA [18234215, 1911941].  conformational flexibility of unbound LexA is  key element in establishing a coordinated SOS response [21576225].
LexA is widely distributed in bacteria, and it appears that it emerged from   gram-positive group [15528664]. <DOM>It shows two domains,  N-terminal domain involved in DNA binding via a helix-turn-helix [8076591] and  C-terminal domain involved in dimerization and in cleavage activity [11551506, 2968919].</DOM>
To repress transcription, LexA blocks  access of RNA polymerase to target promoters [7027255].
LexA dimer [10671501] <SSA>recognizes and binds to  an <SSM>imperfect inverted repeat DNA sequence</SSM> called  LexA box or SOS box</SSA> [14630651, 6371470]. Although,  majority of  LexA-regulated genes have only one SOS box, some have two or three boxes which sometimes overlap [18524933].
 crystal structure of  LexA-DNA complex has been determined [20703307]. <DOM> DNA-binding domains of  LexA dimer interact with  DNA in  classical fashion of a winged helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, and y bind to  same minor groove of  DNA [20703307].</DOM>
<TURO>lexA is  first gene in  lexA-dinF operon</TURO> [6298183] dinF encodes a member of  MATE family of multidrug efflux transporters [9987140].
 SOS system is induced by methylglyoxal (MG), based on ChIP-chip analysis with DNA-RNAP occupancy, and this involves LexA-regulated genes such as recAX, lexA-dinF, and dinB [23646895].
