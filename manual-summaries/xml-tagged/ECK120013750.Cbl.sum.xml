transcription factor Cbl, for  cysB like,  is a regulator involved in  expression of genes required for <RP>aliphatic sulfonate utilization and homeostatic response to sulfate starvation </RP>[9401024, 10506196, 8529872, 10717312, 11479697, 11918818]. Cbl does not require a ligand to binds to its DNA-binding site, but <ACTCONDN> activity of this protein is negatively regulated by  5'-phophosulfate cofactor</ACTCONDN> [11918818].
This protein <EVF>belongs to  large LysR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> and it is positively regulated by CysB, which <EVPIT>is similar to Cbl (40% identity)</EVPIT> [8529872, 15333946]. <DOM>Members of this family have two domains, an N-terminal domain with a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a large C-terminal domain  [8529872, 15333946, 17010379]. In systematic studies of oligomerization, it was shown that some members of  LysR family, like Cbl, interact with or members of  family to form heterodimers, but  physiological significance of this is unknown [21187915].</DOM>
crystal structure of  C-terminal regulatory domain of Cbl (2.8Ã…) has been solved  [17010379].
