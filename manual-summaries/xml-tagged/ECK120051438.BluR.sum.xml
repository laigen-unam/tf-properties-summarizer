<DOM>BluR is a MerR-like regulator that contains an N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding region and a ligand-binding region in  C-terminal domain [12829265]. </DOM>
BluR functions as a repressor for genes involved in <RP> modulation of biofilm formation and for acid resistance genes </RP>[19240136]. <ACTCONDP>Its expression is strongly induced at low temperatures</ACTCONDP> [19240136, 19011022, 18174134].
BluR is a paralogue of MlrA, and it represses  transcription of  ycgZ-ymgA-ariR-ymgC operon [19240136, 22783906]. This operon is transcribed divergently on  opposite strand, under  control of Ïƒ38 (RpoS) RNA polymerase [19240136, 18158297]. Its gene products are involved in  production of colanic acid, a component of  biofilm matrix, via  Rcs phosphorelay system [17222132, 17609140, 17765265, 19172264].  bluRF-ycgZ-ymgA-ariR region is conserved in various enteric bacteria [19240136, 22783906].
BluR binds to  promoter region of ycgZ. BluF is an antagonist of BluR [19240136, 22783906]. It binds to  N-terminal domain of BluR and inhibits  DNA-binding activity of BluR. Binding of BluF to BluR is stimulated by blue light [19240136, 22783906].
Although <TUL>bluR and bluF are transcribed in  same direction and located next to each or on  chromosome, y do not constitute an operon</TUL> [19240136].
