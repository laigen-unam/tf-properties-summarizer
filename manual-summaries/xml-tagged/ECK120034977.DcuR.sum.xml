DcuR regulates several genes involved in <RP>C4-dicarboxylate metabolism [9973351]. In addition, a recent microarray-based global transcriptional profiling study suggested that  DcuR regulon could comprise at least 39 genes, including some involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynsis and some involved in anaerobic nitrate and nitrite respiration</RP> [12366850].
DcuR is  response regulator in  two-component regulatory system DcuR/DcuS and is a <EVF>member of  CitAB subfamily of His protein kinases</EVF> [9973351, 9765574]. Autophosphorylation of DcuS is stimulated by C4-dicarboxylates such as fumarate or succinate, and  phosphate group is transferred to DcuR, which is converted to a dimeric form [15073297, 12167640, 14996819].
<DOM>This protein contains an N-terminal receiver domain that includes  aspartate residue (Asp-56) for phosphorylation and a C-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding [9973351, 9765574].</DOM> <SSA><SSM>Two directly repeated hexameric DNA sequences</SSM> that are highly enriched in A/T residues</SSA> have been proposed to be  sites recognized by a DcuR dimer [14996819].
Both <TURO>dcuR, encoding  response regulator, and dcuS, encoding  sensor kinase, are organized in an operon</TURO> that is <TUL>located upstream of  dcuB-fumB operon</TUL>, whose <TUR>expression is activated by DcuR</TUR> [14996819]. <TURO> dcuSR operon contains two promoters, an external one that transcribes both genes and an internal</TURO> one that only transcribes to dcuR and that is activated by CRP [17618229]. Neir of se two promoters is regulated by DcuR [15995204]. <TUCREG> full operon is repressed by  nitrate acting through  NarXL regulatory system</TUCREG>, so that E.coli will use nitrate as a respiratory electron acceptor before fumarate [15995204].]
Overproduction of DcuR causes a drug resistance phenotype [12618449].
