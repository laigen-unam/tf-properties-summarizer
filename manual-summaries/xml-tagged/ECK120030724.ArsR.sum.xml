ArsR negatively controls  expression of  genes involved in <RP>arsenical and antimonite metals resistance</RP> whose expression is induced in  presence of se metals [7860609, 7721697, 8764681, 8576202]. <TUR><ACTREG>This protein is autoregulated</ACTREG>; <TUL>arsR is  first gene in  arsRBC operon</TUL> that it regulates</TUR> [7721697]. 
ArsR <EVF>belongs to  ArsR/SmtB family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> that respond to a variety of metals [12829264].<DOM> ArsR has a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding, a  metal-binding site [8051064] and a dimerization domain [9188467].  inducer-binding sites for  members of this family appear to have arisen by convergent evolution [17897948]. In ArsR  inducer-binding site contains three cysteine residues that bind <ACTEFFE>arsenite and antimonite</ACTEFFE> specifically and with high affinity [8051064, 8621591].</DOM>
<ACTCONDP>Dimerization of ArsR is required for DNA binding</ACTCONDP> and its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor [9188467].  dimer recognizes and binds to <SSA>a 12-2-12 <SSM>inverted repeat</SSM></SSA> [12829264, 8576202] but <ACTCONDN> binding of arsenic or antimonite to ArsR causes a conformational change in it, leading to dissociation from DNA and hence derepression</ACTCONDN> [8621591].
chromosomal ArsR shows 75% identity to ArsR of  Escherichia coli plasmid R773 and 26% identity to staphylococcal plasmid pI258 and pSX267 ArsR proteins [7860609].
ArsR when overexpressed has  capacity to remove arsenic species from contaminated water [15294789, 23484908].
ArsR:  homologous to  arsenate inducibility regulator  [7721697].
Review: [12829264].
