E. coli multidrug resistance regulator  [1409590, 7730261] EmrR, negatively regulates  transcription of genes that code for <RP>multidrug resistance pumps that extrude structurally unrelated antimicrobial agents from  cell [7730261, 11321589] and possibly it also represses a gene that codes for  a porin</RP> [11321589]. When EmrR is overexpressed ( emrR gene in multicopy), it is able to repress  marRAB operon, which encodes two transcriptional regulators [8521301].  
EmrR, which is also known as MprA,  microcin production regulation, locus A  [2152912] has also been shown to be a repressor of plasmid-encoded genes involved in microcin biosynsis [2152912, 1840583, 9484896]. Microcins are low-molecular-weight polypeptide antibiotics [4071].
EmrR dimer binds 2,4-dinitrophenol, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoro-methoxy)phenylhydrazone, predicted ligands of  EmrAB pump, with high affinity [10438794]. Binding of se agents interferes with  ability of EmrR to bind DNA [10991887]. This dimeric protein [10438794]<SSA>recognizes and binds an <SSM>imperfect inverted repeat</SSM> DNA sequence</SSA> [10991887].
<ACTREG>EmrR <EVF>belongs to  MarR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> [8521301] which respond to a variety of phenolic compounds</ACTREG> and are found in gram-positive and gram-negative species as well as in mycobacteria [8521301]. <DOM> proteins of this family have a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif at  center [9141683] while  ligand-binding domain is possibly located at  N-terminal domain [10438794].</DOM> EmrR <EVPIT>shows 28% and 47% identity and similarity, respectively, to  MarR protein</EVPIT> [8521301].
Overproduction of EmrR from a multicopy plasmid causes a mutator phenotype that includes an increase in frameshift and base substitution mutations [15225322]. 
<TUL>emrR is  first gene of  emrRAB operon</TUL> whose <TUCREG>transcription is induced by antimicrobial agents such as salicylic acid,  CCCP, and nalidixic acid, among ors</TUCREG>; induction requires  repressor of  operon EmrR [7730261]. <TUR>Expression of emrR is not osmoregulated</TUR> [1840583].
