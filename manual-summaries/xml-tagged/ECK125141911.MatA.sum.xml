MatA is a LuxR-type transcription factor that is directly involved, as a positive regulator acting at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, in  expression of  mat operon in meningitis isolate strain IHE 3034 [22422754]. On  or hand, MatA <RP>controls  expression of  flhDC operon</RP>, with higher affinity to flhDp, repressing flagellum biosynsis, motility, and taxis [22422754].
opposite regulatory actions of MatA on mat and on flhDC promoters advance  adaptation of E. coli from a planktonic to an adhesive lifestyle [22422754]. MatA binds more weakly to pfliA and to pfliC, and ir levels are equal to those observed for matB [22422754].
MatA exerts a dual regulatory function on <RP> choice of planktonic/sessile lifestyle and furr supports  presence of antagonistic control of attachment and motility</RP>. MatA is tightly integrated into two separate regulatory circuits, H-NS-MatA-flhDC and RcsB-MatA-flhDC, both of which control expression of  flagellum.
MatA interferes with bacterial motility and flagellar synsis in meningitis-associated isolate IHE 3034 as well as K-12 strains of Escherichia coli [22422754].
