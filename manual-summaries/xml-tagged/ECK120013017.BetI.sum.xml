Betaine inhibitor,  BetI, acts as a repressor of glycine betaine synsis from choline  [8626294]. <TUR><ACTREG>It is negatively autoregulated</ACTREG></TUR> and coordinately represses transcription of <RP> choline transporter and  operon related to  synsis of glycine betaine</RP>. se divergent operons are expressed only under aerobic conditions and are induced by osmotic stress [1956285].
BetI is an unusual repressor because it remains bound to DNA during induction. <ACTCONDP>BetI forms a complex with DNA in  presence of choline</ACTCONDP>, <SSZ>binding to a 20-bp-long sequence</SSZ> with dyad symmetry that overlaps betTp and betIp simultaneously [8626295].  position of  repressor gene within  operon is unusual too, as regulatory genes tend to be positioned at  end of operons and this gene is located at  beginning of  operon.
BetI <EVF>belongs to  TetR/AcrR family of transcriptional regulators</EVF> [8626295, 1956285].<DOM> This protein composed of two domains, an amino-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a carboxy-terminal domain involved in co-inducer recognition and dimerization [1956285].</DOM>
