ZraR,  zinc resistance-associated regulator,  controls  expression of genes involved in <RP>tolerance to high zinc concentrations</RP>. ZraR recognizes a <SSA>DNA sequence of <SSZ>two <SSM>inverted repeats</SSM> of 17 bp separated by 12 bp</SSZ></SSA> [11243806].
This regulator is a member of  two-component regulatory system ZraS/ZraR. <TURO> operon containing both genes zraR, encoding  response regulator, and zraS, encoding  sensor kinase, <TUL>is located next to and in  opposite direction to zraP</TUL></TURO> , a gene regulated by ZraR. It has been suggested that ZraS  functions as a zinc receptor [11243806]. ZraS and ZraR show considerable homology with  proteins NtrB and NtrC, respectively [2666400].
<DOM>ZraR also <EVF>belongs to  group of σ54-dependent transcriptional regulators</EVF> [11243806]. Members of this group contain three domains:  sensory domain located in  N terminus,  central domain involved in ATP hydrolysis and interaction with σ54, and  C-terminal domain, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif [16005641, 2666400].</DOM>
A regulatory role related to  activity of  enzyme hydrogenase 3 has been assigned to ZraR (previously called HydG) [2666400] but it was demonstrated that this regulation was nonspecific [11243806].    
Based on a crystal structure of ZraR from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium,  it has been suggested that this protein may function as a dodecamer [16005641].
Transcription of zraR is induced by zinc stress [15659689]and high levels of c-di-GMP [16418169].
