DnaA plays an important role in <RP>initiating chromosomal replication</RP> to bind sequences in  chromosomal origin. 
<EVF>It belongs to  DnaA family of transcriptional regulators</EVF>.
<ACTREG>DnaA also <SSA>binds to sites at  datA locus</SSA> and this binding serves to limit excess DnaA activity,</ACTREG> but or DnaA-binding sites are shown not to share this function [12068813]. 
Regulation has been described [11483528, 9674428, 16077105]. IdaB is a member of  AAA chaperone-like family of ATPases [11483528] that is required for  inhibition of  initiation of DNA synsis via antagonism of DnaA activity by  DNA polymerase III beta subunit (sliding clamp) [9674428, 11483528].  IdaB and  sliding clamp stimulate ATP hydrolysis within  DnaA-ATP complex, which renders it inactive, and DNA replication activity also contributes to this downregulation [9674428].
DnaA also can inhibit  gene expression of or genes such as guaA, dam, rpoH, ftsA, and mioC.
