acriflavine resistance regulator , AcrR, regulates  expression of genes involved in <RP>multidrug transport</RP> and is <EVF>classified in  nodulation-resistance division family</EVF> [8821940].  It also acts as a global repressor for  mar-sox-rob regulon [25176444].
<DOM> crystal structure of AcrR shows that this protein is folded into nine Î±-helices distributed in two domains:  DNA-binding domain, which forms  typical helix-turn-helix in  N-terminal domain, and  ligand-binding domain, which forms a large internal cavity for multidrug binding in  C-terminal domain [17950313]. Mutational analyses have been used to identify  critical role of some amino acids for AcrR activity, such as Glu-67 [17950313] and Arg-45 [16189130].</DOM>
activity of AcrR, which <EVF>belongs to  TetR family</EVF>, appears to be <ACTREG>regulated by ligands such as <ACTEFFE>rhodamine 6G, ethidium, and proflavin</ACTEFFE></ACTREG> [17644067]. When one of se ligands is bound to  C-terminal domain of AcrR, a conformational change in  N-terminal domain releases  regulator from its DNA-binding site. It has been suggested that  three AcrR ligands bind to distinct overlapping sites [17950313] and that two of m (ethidium and proflavin) can be simultaneously bound in  cavity [17644067]. This cavity has an inner surface with negative potential and  ligands are positively charged, thus favoring  binding between m [17950313].
<TUR> acrR gene, whose <TUCREG>expression is increased under general stress conditions</TUCREG> [8821940], is autoregulated</TUR> and divergently transcribed from  acrAB operon. <SSA>An <SSM>inverted repeat</SSM> <SSZ>sequence of 24 bp</SSZ> that overlaps  acrAB promoter</SSA> has been identified as  AcrR-binding site [17644067]. This site is bound by two dimers of AcrR [17950313, 17644067].
Overproduction of AcrR improves organic solvent tolerance (OTS) through regulation of  SoxS regulon [25176444].
