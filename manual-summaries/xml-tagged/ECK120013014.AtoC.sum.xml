AtoC, also known as antizyme protein (Az), is a protein that regulates processes at  transcriptional and posttranslational levels [15200682]. It inhibits posttranslationally <RP>ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) [15200682] which is a key enzyme for biosynsis of  polyamines which are essential components for cellular growth and proliferation [3157043]. On  or hand, <ACTCONDP>in  presence of acetoacetate, AtoC regulates  transcription of  atoDAEB operon</ACTCONDP> [17616594, 2883171] whose products are  involved in catabolism of short-chain fatty acids [4563344]. However, transcriptome analyses have shown that this protein not only regulates this operon but also upregulates or downregulates  11 and 32 genes, respectively, that are involved in flagellar synsis [12366850]. On  or hand,  phenotypical analysis with an AtoS mutant showed reduced motility, sodium chloride sensitivity, and increased susceptibility to membrane-acting agents and an aminoglycoside antibiotic [12897016]. AtoSC is involved in  flagellar regulon, controlling  motility and chemotaxis responses [22083893]. 
Through atoDAEB operon regulation, AtoC modules positively  biosynsis and  intracellular distribution of poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (cPHB)</RP>, a biopolymer with many physiological roles [16564134].  products of  catabolism of short-chain fatty acids appear to be  substrates in  biosynsis of this polymer [16564134]. By an unknown mechanism, histamine and extracellular Ca2+ appear to be signals that modulate AtoS/AtoC-dependent cPHB production [18235991, 18855762].
AtoC is  response regulator in  two-component regulatory system AtoC/AtoS [16153782]. Autophosphorylation of AtoS appears to be stimulated by acetoacetate or one of its metabolic products [16564134]. n, <DOM> phosphate group is transferred from AtoS to  D55 residue of AtoC to activate this protein [17537579, 16153782]. It has also been suggested that  D55 residue could transfer  phosphate group to  H73 residue of AtoC [17537579].
AtoC <EVF>belongs to  NtrC-NifA family of σ54-RNA polymerase transcriptional activators</EVF> [17537579] and, as for a number of  members of this family, AtoC  contains three domains:  N-terminal receiver domain to be phosphorylated,  central domain involved in ATP hydrolysis and interaction with σ54, and  DNA-binding C-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix motif  [17537579].</DOM>
It was suggested that AtoC oligomerizes, but  stoichiometry is unknown [15200682]. This protein recognizes and binds a <SSZ>sequence of 20 bp in DNA</SSZ> [17616594]. In  atoDAEB regulatory region re are two of se sites arranged as inverted repeats separated by 1 bp [17616594].  However, a BLAST analysis showed that although re are several regions with significant homology to  20-bp AtoC-binding site, y are not arranged as palindromes [17616594]. AtoC-dependent atoDAEB transcription requires  presence and binding of IHF [17616594].
Proteins with antizyme activity have been found in several organisms, from plants to eubacteria [15200682]. A BLAST analysis showed AtoC is homologous in proteobacteria,  enterobacteria, eubacteria, and spirochetes [15200682].
atoC, encoding  response regulator, and atoS, encoding  sensor kinase, are <TUL>located in  genome upstream of  atoDAEB operon</TUL> [3025185]. <TUCREG> transcription of  gene atoC is induced by polyamines [17224065] and histamine</TUCREG> [18235991] microarray analysis shows <TUR>that OmpR may regulate  transcription of this gene [12366850].  On  or hand, it does not appear to be autoregulated</TUR> [2883171].
