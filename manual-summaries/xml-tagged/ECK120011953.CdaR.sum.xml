Carbohydrate diacid regulator,  CdaR, or  sugar diacid regulator,  SdaR, regulates genes involved in <RP> uptake and metabolism of galactarate and glucarate</RP>, and <ACTREG>it <TUR>is also  autoregulated</TUR></ACTREG> [10762278]. 
<ACTCONDP>SdaR responds to d-galactarate and d-glucarate, and even better to d-glycerate to activate  genes it regulates</ACTCONDP> [10762278]. In addition, it was found that 2-O-Î±-mannosyl-d-glycerate (MG) can induce  SdaR regulon [14645248] MG has been recognized as a protective osmolyte in hyperrmophylic prokaryotes and as a carbon source for Escherichia coli [14645248].
<DOM>This protein has a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding in  C-terminal domain [10762278]. </DOM>
<TUL> exact position and sequence that SdaR binds to in DNA have not been yet determined</TUL>.
