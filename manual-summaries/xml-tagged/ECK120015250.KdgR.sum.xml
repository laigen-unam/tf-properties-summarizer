2-Keto-3-deoxygluconate repressor, KdgR, is a DNA-binding transcription factor that represses transcription of  operons involved in <RP>transport and catabolism of 2-keto-3-deoxy gluconate (KDG)</RP> [15659677, 4359651, 4571523, 4625742]. Synsis of se genes is induced when E. coli is grown in  presence of KDG and under high-temperature conditions, between 32 and 35Â°C. 
Although little is known about  regulating mechanism of KdgR, it has been shown to act as a repressor that binds to a <SSA>putative <SSM>inverted repeat sequence</SSM></SSA> [11115104, 8107132]. Comparative analysis of intergenic DNA sequences showed  consistent occurrence of KdgR possible binding sites upstream of  genes not related to  transport and catabolism of KDG [11115104, 15528647].
