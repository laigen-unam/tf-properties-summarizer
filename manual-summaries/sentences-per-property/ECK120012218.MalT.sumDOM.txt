 MalT subunits consist of four domains : C-terminal DNA-binding domain , N-terminal ATP-binding domain , and two domains -LRB- DT2 and DT3 -RRB- involved in effector recognition -LRB- maltotriose -RRB- . 
Based on an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach , it was shown that  inducer maltotriose  binds inside cavity of tetratricopeptide-like sensor domain of MalT , a bacterial STAND transcription factor . 
Maltotriose plays a dual role in signal transduction by MalT ; it triggers nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain -LRB- NOD -RRB- opening and renders MalT multimeric platform competent for downstream signaling  .
