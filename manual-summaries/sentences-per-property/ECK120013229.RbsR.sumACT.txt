transcription factor RbsR , for Ribose Repressor ,   is negatively autoregulated   and controls transcription of operon involved in ribose catabolism and transport . 
 When D-ribose binds to RbsR , protein becomes inactive  because binding affinity of RbsR decreases . 
 Although little is known about mechanism of regulation of RbsR transcription factor , Mauzy et al. in 1992 demonstrated that this regulator acts as a repressor by binding to cis-acting elements , which have a conserved  inverted repeat sequence  and overlap rbsD promoter  .
