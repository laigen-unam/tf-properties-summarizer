 Expression of allS gene is negligible under aerobic conditions and is increased under anaerobic conditions in presence of glyoxylate or allantoin . 
In absence of its repressor , AllR , allS is expressed under nitrogen-limiting growth conditions , but its induction is independent of regulators Nac and NtrC , which are active under se conditions  .
