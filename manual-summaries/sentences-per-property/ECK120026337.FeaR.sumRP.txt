Phenylethylamine regulator , FeaR , is considered an activator of  phenylacetate synsis from 2-phenylethylamine -LRB- PEA -RRB- . 
 This regulator is regulated by catabolic repression  , and highly expressed in presence of succinate . 
FeaR controls expression of a pathway for degradation of potentially toxic aromatic compounds . 
 It is induced by tyramine , and in absence of glucose , it activates expression of amine oxidase and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase  , proteins involved in 2-phenylethylamine catabolism  .
