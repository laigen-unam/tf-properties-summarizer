  This protein is autoregulated  ;  arsR is first gene in arsRBC operon  that it regulates  . 
In ArsR inducer-binding site contains three cysteine residues that bind  arsenite and antimonite  specifically and with high affinity  . 
 Dimerization of ArsR is required for DNA binding  and its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor . 
dimer recognizes and binds to  a 12-2-12  inverted repeat   but  binding of arsenic or antimonite to ArsR causes a conformational change in it , leading to dissociation from DNA and hence derepression  .
