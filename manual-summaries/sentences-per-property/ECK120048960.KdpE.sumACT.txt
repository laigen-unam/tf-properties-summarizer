Subsequently ,   phosphate group is transferred from KdpD to Asp-52 of KdpE leading to dimerization and activation of KdpE   . 
 Under salt stress , universal stress protein UspC binds to KdpE and stabilizes KdpD-KdpE-DNA complex  ; refore , this system can be activated even though K + accumulates under this environmental condition .
