HypT  belongs to LysR-type transcriptional regulator family  , which  protects cells from HOCl damage . 
HypT  belongs to large family of LTTRs  and is conserved in α - , β - , and γ-proteobacteria and eukaryotes -LRB- Xenopus tropicalis -RRB- , which suggests conservation of HOCl response in evolution and its maintenance throughout kingdoms .
