LysR  belongs to family LysR  , which  contains three domains : an amino-terminal domain that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif ; a central domain , with response domains much less conserved , that possibly are important for coinducer-responsive transcription ; and a C-terminal domain that includes key residues possibly involved in DNA interactions and coinducer response  .
