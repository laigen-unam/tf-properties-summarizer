 DNA binding by ArgP is prevented when serine protease Do -LRB- DegP -RRB- hydrolyzes this transcriptional regulator  . 
When this protein activates genes involved in replication ,  it appears to bind to ir regulatory regions without a coeffector  . 
However ,  activity of ArgP depends on arginine and lysine to regulate genes involved in arginine metabolism  .
