It has been proved by Koch and colleagues that  rcnR gene is target of Fur regulation in regard to iron levels  -LRB- when iron increases , rcnR expression increases about 2.3-fold . 
As  rcnR expression is induced in response to iron even in absence of Fur  it is possible that RcnR responds to iron ions directly .
