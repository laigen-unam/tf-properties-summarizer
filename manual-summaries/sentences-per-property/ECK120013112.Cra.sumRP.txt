Catabolite repressor activator , Cra , which was initially named Fructose repressor , FruR , is a dual transcriptional regulator that plays a  pleiotropic role to modulate direction of carbon flow through different metabolic pathways of energy metabolism , but independently of CRP regulator . 
For this reason FruR regulator is implicated in expression of a large number of operons that encode enzymes which comprise central pathways of carbon metabolism . 
FruR acts as an activator of genes encoding gluconeogenic Krebs cycle and glyoxylate shunt enzymes , and negative effect on genes encoding Entner-Doudoroff pathway and glycolytic enzymes  .
