 typical motif of members of this family , ribbon-helix-helix motif for DNA binding , has been observed in crystalline structure of MetJ . 
This motif is composed of a two-stranded antiparallel β-ribbon that lies along DNA major groove , two outer α-helices that interact with adjacent proteins along DNA , and two inner β-helices that form subunit interface  .
