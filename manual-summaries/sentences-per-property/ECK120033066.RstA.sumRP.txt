RstA appears to control genes involved in different biological processes , such as  acid tolerance , curli fimbria formation , and anaerobic respiration , among ors . 
Some phenotypes caused by RstA have been identified by mutational analysis . 
For example , RstA is a suppressor of a lesion in yjeE , a gene essential for cell growth and whose cellular function is unknown . 
RstA overproduction causes drug resistance  .
