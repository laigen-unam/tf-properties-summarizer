Dihydroxyacetone Regulator , DhaR ,  is negatively autoregulated  and coordinately activates transcription of divergent Dha operon -LRB- dhaKLM -RRB- , which encodes  three subunits of dihydroxyacetone -LRB- Dha -RRB- kinase  . 
 DhaR is inactivated when DnaK binds to sensing domain of this regulator  , in absence of Dha . 
 In presence of Dha , DhaL : : ADP displaces DhaK or blocks association of DhaK/DhaR complex and DhaR activates transcription of Dha operon  .
