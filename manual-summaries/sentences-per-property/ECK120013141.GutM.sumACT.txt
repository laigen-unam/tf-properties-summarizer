In addition , Yamada et al. suggested that regulators GutM and GutR have contrary effects ;  in absence of glucitol , GutR represses transcription of gut operon  , and  in presence of glucitol , GutR interacts with this carbohydrate to dissociate from DNA  , causing increases of GutM in sufficient amounts to increase transcription of gut operon .
