This regulator is sensitive to catabolite control and  is induced when Escherichia coli is grown on maltodextrin in absence of glucose  . 
Based on an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach , it was shown that  inducer maltotriose  binds inside cavity of tetratricopeptide-like sensor domain of MalT , a bacterial STAND transcription factor . 
 MalT activity is negatively regulated by Aes and MalY through direct protein-protein interactions and competition with maltotriose for MalT binding  .
