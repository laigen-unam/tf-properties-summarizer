transcription factor IscR , for Iron-sulfur cluster Regulator ,  is negatively autoregulated  , and it contains an iron-sulfur cluster that could act as a sensor of iron-sulfur cluster assembly . 
 IscR requires iron-sulfur cluster for its activity when bound to type 1 sites  . 
 binding of -LSB- 2Fe-2S -RSB- 1 + cluster  allows IscR to induce a conformational change , mainly around residue Glu43 , that modifies its DNA-binding affinity .
