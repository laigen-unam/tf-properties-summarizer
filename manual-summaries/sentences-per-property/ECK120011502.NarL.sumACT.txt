This reaction is specific , that is ,  NarL-P is only desphosphorylated by NarX  . 
 system discriminates between nitrate and nitrite . 
In presence of nitrate both sensors phosphorylate NarL and NarP to same extent . 
In presence of nitrite , NarX phosphorylates NarP but acts primarily as a phosphatase for NarL-P  .
