 This regulator is positively autoregulated and co-regulates with CRP  , a global transcriptional regulator ; se regulators bind cooperatively to activate transcription of an operon related to transport and catabolism of l-idonate . 
 In presence of l-idonate , IdnR  binds to  16-nucleotide-long DNA-target sites  in idnK/idnDOTR intergenic region   to coordinately activate transcription of idnKp and idnDp .
