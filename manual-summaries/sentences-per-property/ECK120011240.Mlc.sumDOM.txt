 N-terminal region has a helix-turn-helix domain , and a C-terminal helix is implicated in EIICBGlc binding . 
Mlc forms tetramers in solution . 
Mlc monomer is composed of three domains : a DNA-binding motif -LRB- D-domain -RRB- , an EIICBGlc-binding motif -LRB- E-domain -RRB- , and an oligomerization domain -LRB- O-domain -RRB-  .
