Accordingly ,  this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains : a conserved N-terminal domain which contains DNA-binding region , and carboxy-terminal domain , which is involved in effector binding and dimerization . 
GalR and GalS have only two substitutions in first helix of N-terminal domain  .
