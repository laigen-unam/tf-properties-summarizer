This regulator has a dual function and   is positively and negatively autoregulated   . 
 In absence of L-lactate and under anaerobic conditions , this regulator repressed transcription of lldPRD operon  . 
 Expression of this regulator is also stimulated in presence of L-lactate  , and this inductor promotes a conformational change that probably destabilizes DNA loop , promoting transcription open complex .
