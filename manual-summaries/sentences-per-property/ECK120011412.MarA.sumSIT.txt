These three monomer proteins bind to the same DNA site ,  a degenerate  19-bp sequence  known as  the sox-mar-rob box  , which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the -35 and -10 boxes of the promoter  . 
 The sox-mar-rob box contains an invariant A at position 1 , two recognition elements , the RE1 at postion 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18 , and a 7-bp A/T-rich spacer separating these elements  .
