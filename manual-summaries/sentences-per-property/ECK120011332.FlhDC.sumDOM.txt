flagellar regulator is conformed by two FlhD subunits and two FlhC subunits , as a heterotetramer while  FlhD is constituted by two domains : N-terminal domain is responsible for dimerization and C terminal is a highly flexible domain contain DNA-binding -LRB- helix-turn-helix motif -RRB- region . 
FlhC is constituted by two domains ; arrangement of domains is unique in FlhC family  .
