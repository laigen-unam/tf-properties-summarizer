  It is negatively autoregulated   and coordinately represses transcription of  choline transporter and operon related to synsis of glycine betaine  . 
 BetI forms a complex with DNA in presence of choline  ,  binding to a 20-bp-long sequence  with dyad symmetry that overlaps betTp and betIp simultaneously .
