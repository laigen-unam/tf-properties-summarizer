Based on analysis with Genomic SELEX screening system , PgrR was identified as a repressor of expression of genes of  initial enzymes for peptidoglycan -LRB- PG -RRB- peptide degradation as well as genes of switch control between recycling and degradation of PG peptides  , which are induced upon exposure to heat shock or membrane distortion . 
se targets were identified by Genomic SELEX analysis and include genes related to  membrane formation and function  : leuL , leuO , pheP , ycjY , pgrR , yedS , xapR , yfgF , yfgG , rfaL , and rfaS . 
A ycjZ mutant shows a defect in  swarming motility  , but no defect in swimming motility .
