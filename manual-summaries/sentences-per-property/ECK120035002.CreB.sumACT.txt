 It is active when cells are fermenting glycolytic carbon sources  . 
A model of regulation by CreBC was proposed by Cariss et al. -LRB- 2008 -RRB- in which  CreC responds to changes in growth medium and/or signal and autophosphorylates ; later , its phosphate is passed on to CreB  , which binds to cre tag sequences . 
 antimicrobial peptide lactoferricin B , binds to CreB and inhibits its phosphorylation in vitro  .
