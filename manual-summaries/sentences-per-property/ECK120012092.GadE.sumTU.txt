transcriptional activator GadE , for Glutamic acid decarboxylase ,   is positively autoregulated   and controls transcription of genes involved in  maintenance of pH homeostasis , including principal acid resistance system glutamate dependent -LRB- GAD -RRB- , also referred as GAD system , and genes involved in multidrug efflux  , among ors . 
 GadE is encoded by gadE-mdtEF operon  ,  inducible by low pH  which is located in region called acid fitness island .
