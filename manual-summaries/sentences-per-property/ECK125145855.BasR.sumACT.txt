 BasS functions as a membrane-associated protein kinase that phosphorylates BasR  in response to elevated levels of Fe -LRB- III -RRB-   which can permeabilize outer membrane and result in cell death . 
 Phosphorylation of BasR increases affinity for its specific DNA binding sites  , leading to transcriptional expression of several genes involved in  modification of lipopolysaccharide to prevent excessiveFe -LRB- III -RRB- binding  .
