NikR , Nickel-responsive repressor , is a tetramer and  consists of two domains . 
crystal structures of C-terminal domain , apo-NikR , nickel-activated NikR , and NikR in complex with its operator DNA have been solved . 
C-terminal 83 amino acids form tetrameric core , which carries high-affinity nickel-binding site and resembles ACT fold of  ACT -LRB- aspartokinase , chorismate mutase , TyrA -RRB- family  . 
Two N-terminal domains intertwine to form a dimeric DNA-binding ribbon-helix-helix -LRB- RHH -RRB- domain . 
two RHH DNA-binding domains flank tetrameric core of protein . 
NikR tetramer contains four high-affinity nickel-binding sites located at subunit interfaces of C-terminal domain and additional low-affinity metal-binding sites  . 
Based on crystal structure and mutation analyses , it was determined that  K64 and R65 residues are crucial for NikR functions  on nikAp1 promoter in vivo . 
 His48 and His110 are residues that participate in low-affinity Ni -LRB- II -RRB- - binding response . 
In addition to four high-affinity nickel-binding sites , crystal structure reveals two binding sites for potassium ions , bridging metal - and DNA-binding domains . 
It is still disputed wher se sites actually resemble low-affinity binding sites for nickel ions or wher se sites function as potassium-binding sites  .
