LeuO is a dual transcriptional regulator that regulates genes involved in  leucine biosynsis , genes involved in utilization of certain Î²-glucosides and genes encoding LuxR-type transcription factors . 
It is also involved in bacterial stringent response  . 
An in vivo genetic selection -LRB- SELEX -RRB- and phenotype microarray analysis revealed several  multidrug resistance genes as targets for LeuO , including acrEF , ygcLKJIH-ygbTF , and mdtNOP -LRB- sdsRQP -RRB- . 
mdtNOP -LRB- sdsRQP -RRB- is involved in sensitivity control against sulfa drugs . 
A total of 140 genes were found to be under LeuO control , based on genomic SELEX screening ; 133 of se genes are related to stress response , pathogenesis expression , and fimbrial genes for biofilm formation  and are under control of an antagonistic interplay between LeuO and H-NS .
