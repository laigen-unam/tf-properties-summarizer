 CRP is a homodimer and consists of two domains connected by a short hinge region . 
The C-terminal a-helical DNA-binding domain carries a characteristic helix-turn-helix motif . 
It dimerizes in apo-CRP , with the DNA recognition helix F buried within its core . 
The N-terminal dimerization domain mainly consists of ÃŸ-sheets and carries a hydrophobic pocket for binding of cAMP . 
A long a-helix , termed the C-helix , forms an intersubunit coiled-coil . 
This helix plays a central role in the allosteric activation of CRP  . 
 Two regions of CRP , AR1 -LRB- activation region 1 -RRB- , located in the C-terminal domain , and AR2 , located in the N-terminal domain , are known to interact with RNA polymerase -LRB- RNAP -RRB-  .
