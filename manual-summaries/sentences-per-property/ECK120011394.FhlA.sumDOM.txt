As  a member of group of σ54-dependent transcriptional regulators  ,  FhlA contains three domains : a possible sensory domain located in N terminus that probably modulates activity of C-terminal domain central domain , which is probably involved in open complex formation , ATP hydrolysis , and interaction with σ54 and formate and C-terminal domain , which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding  .
