YqjI regulator is structurally  related to PadR family  ,  which is characterized by a winged helix-turn-helix -LRB- WHTH -RRB- motif . 
amino-terminal region of this protein is similar to C-terminal SlyD protein and to N-terminal RcnA protein . 
Comparison with crystal structure of AphA protein from Vibrio cholerae suggests that amino terminal of YqjI contains WHTH motif and that in C-terminal domain is located ligand-binding domain for oligomerization  .
