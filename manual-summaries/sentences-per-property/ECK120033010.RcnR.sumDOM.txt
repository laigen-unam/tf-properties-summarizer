 An RcnR structure study showed that it has a charged N-terminal region -LRB- amino acids 1-34 -RRB- , followed by a highly conserved region of primarily nonpolar amino acids -LRB- 35-64 -RRB- , that is , probably involved in binding metals . 
N terminus determines metal-specific responses in recognition of cognate and noncognate metals . 
Its secondary structure prediction shows three helices without any Î²-sheet  .
