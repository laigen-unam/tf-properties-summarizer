Transcription of se operons is induced when E. coli is grown in absence of glucose and when physiological inducer ,  l-arabinose  , binds to AraC regulator . 
 In absence of glucose , cellular cyclic AMP levels are high and cyclic AMP forms a dimeric complex with CRP to coregulate with AraC  . 
 AraC binds to less-conserved site -LRB- -42.5 -RRB- with less strength ; this binding occurs only in presence of arabinose  , and it is absolutely required for expression of araBp . 
 In presence of arabinose , this regulator activates transcription by overlapping -35 box of core promoters  , and central position of binding site is located near bp -41.5 . 
 In absence of arabinose it interacts with DNA-binding domain and constrains this domain , and it releases it in presence of arabinose  .
