UlaR is a DNA-binding transcription factor of 251 amino acids that is  expressed constitutively  and that coordinately represses transcription of a divergent operon -LRB- ula -RRB- involved in  transport and utilization of L-ascorbate catabolism . 
Synsis of se genes is induced when Escherichia coli is grown in absence of glucose , and under anaerobic conditions it can ferment L-ascorbate  ;  under aerobic conditions it is functional in presence of casein acid hydrolysate  .
