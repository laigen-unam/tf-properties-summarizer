 Phosphorylated OmpR controls the transcriptional expression of several genes and operons  whose products are involved in  adaptation to changes in osmolarity , such as major outer membrane porins , and negatively regulates the expression of flagella promotes biofilm formation increases curli genes expression increases expression of several drug exporter genes and confers increased beta-lactam resistance among other effects  . 
 The cross-regulation of OmpR by CpxA , ArcB , or acetyl phosphate results in phosphorylation of OmpR in response to different conditions . 
Although in both Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli the OmpR transcriptional dual regulator is identical , its expression is regulated differently in the two bacterial species  , and there are very large differences in the composition of the OmpR regulon .
