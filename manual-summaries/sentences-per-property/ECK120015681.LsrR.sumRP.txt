Using particular analysis and high-throughput analysis -LRB- microarrays -RRB- , it was established that LsrR regulates expression of many genes involved in several processes , such as  autoinducer 2 uptake and processing , biofilm architecture , host invasion , stress responses , and foreign DNA , among ors . 
It also regulates expression of small riboregulators  .
