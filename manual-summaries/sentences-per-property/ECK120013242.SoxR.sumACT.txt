SoxR protein , for Superoxide Response protein ,  is negatively autoregulated  and controls transcription of regulon involved in  defense against redox-cycling drugs and in responses to nitric oxide  . 
Both Fe-SoxR and apo-SoxR bind to promoter region , but only Fe-SoxR contributes to activation  in its oxidized form  . 
 redox state of iron-sulfur cluster regulates SoxR activity  .
