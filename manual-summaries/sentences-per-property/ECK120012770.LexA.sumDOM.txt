 It shows two domains , N-terminal domain involved in DNA binding via a helix-turn-helix and C-terminal domain involved in dimerization and in cleavage activity  . 
 DNA-binding domains of LexA dimer interact with DNA in classical fashion of a winged helix-turn-helix -LRB- HTH -RRB- motif , and y bind to same minor groove of DNA  .
