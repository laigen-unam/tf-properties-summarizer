Since csgD is induced during mid-exponential phase of growth and CsgD-dependent activation of csg genes is detected in stationary phase , it has been suggested that  CsgD is posttranscriptionally activated in stationary phase  . 
 Five different small RNAs are known to regulate expression of CsgD at post-transcriptional level  ; reviewed in ; a sixth has recently been discovered .
