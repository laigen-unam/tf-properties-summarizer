 BirA monomer contains three domains : an amino-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif ; central domain , which is important for DNA binding and catalysis and contains binding site for bio-5 ' - AMP ; and C-terminal domain , funtion of which has yet to be determinded . 
Disordered loop structures on protein surface appear to be involved in binding to biotin , bio-5 ' - AMP , and/or DNA and in protein dimerization  .
