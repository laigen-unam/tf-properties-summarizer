OxyR , oxidative stress regulator , is transcriptional dual regulator for expression of antioxidant genes  in response to oxidative stress , in particular , elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide  . 
  OxyR acts as a repressor for its own synsis in  both oxidized and reduced forms    . 
 In presence of 100 nM H2O2 , activation occurs by formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys199 and Cys208   . 
 OxyR is also activated under nitrosative stress  ; this reaction involves S-nitrosylation of OxyR .
