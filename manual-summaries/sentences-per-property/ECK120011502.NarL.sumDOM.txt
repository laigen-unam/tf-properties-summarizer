 NarL consists of N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain . 
crystal structures of monomeric full-length protein and of dimeric output domain bound to DNA have been solved . 
In unphosphorylated NarL , DNA-binding site of output domain is blocked by receiver domain . 
Phosphorylation induces separation of both domains , resulting in exposure of previously inaccessible DNA-binding residues and formation of a new dimerization interface in C-terminal domain . 
receiver domain of NarL and NarP could function as a stabilizer of carboxyl-terminal domain -LRB- CTD -RRB- ; it enhances DNA binding and/or enables repression per se in vivo . 
In addition , receiver may make protein-protein contacts necessary for transcription activation  .
