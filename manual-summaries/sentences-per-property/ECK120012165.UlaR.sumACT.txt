Synsis of se genes is induced when Escherichia coli is grown in absence of glucose , and under anaerobic conditions it can ferment L-ascorbate  ;  under aerobic conditions it is functional in presence of casein acid hydrolysate  . 
 L-Ascorbate-6-P is effector of UlaR transcriptional repressor  , and when this small molecule binds to UlaR , it severely impairs formation of UlaR cognate operator sites , since y form a stable complex . 
 UlaR activity is also controlled by homotypic tetramer-dimer transitions regulated by L-ascorbate-6-P  .
