LacI protein  belongs to GalR/LacI family  and as a member of this family of transcriptional regulators ,  LacI contains three domains : a helix-turn-helix motif located in N terminus , central domain that binds to LacI sugar ligands , and C terminal , which comprises tetramerization domain . 
crystal structure of LacI binding site for allosteric effectors has been resolved . 
importance of N125 and D149 residues of N terminal in recognition of sugar effector binding site has been determined  .
