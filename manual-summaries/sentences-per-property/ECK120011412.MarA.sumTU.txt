These three monomer proteins bind to the same DNA site ,  a degenerate  19-bp sequence  known as  the sox-mar-rob box  , which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the -35 and -10 boxes of the promoter  . 
 marA is the second gene of the marRAB operoN  , which  encodes an autorepressor -LRB- MarR -RRB- and an autoactivator -LRB- MarA -RRB-  . 
 MarR is inactivated by salicylate  , and then the operon is induced .
