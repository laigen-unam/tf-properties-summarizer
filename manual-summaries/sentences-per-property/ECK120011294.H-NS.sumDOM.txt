 This regulator  belongs to histone-like family of transcriptional regulators  and structure of protein consists of two structured domains which are separated by a flexible linker . 
N-terminal domain is required for oligomerization and it is involved in protein-protein interactions , while purified C-terminal domain is involved in DNA binding . 
cooperative binding of H-NS to DNA is related to protein-protein interactions . 
H-NS forms two compact clusters associated with each copy of chromosome . 
se clusters are located near one-quarter and three-quarter positions along long axis of cell . 
In cells with three clusters , additional cluster tends to appear in middle . 
two cluster formations are induced by N-terminal domain-driven oligomerization of protein  .
