 PhoB is a dual transcription regulator that  activates expression of Pho regulon in response to environmental Pi   . 
 Under phosphate limitation conditions inner membrane sensor kinase PhoR autophosphorylates . 
Subsequent transfer of phosphate group to PhoB results in activation of PhoB  . 
 When phosphate is in excess , autophosphorylation of PhoR is inhibited and PhoB-P is dephosphorylated  . 
Taken toger se data suggest that  PhoB is activated through an intermolecular mechanism  . 
 Phosphorylation changes relative orientation of subunits to each or , such that orientational constraints between output domains are lost , allowing tandem head-to-tail orientation for active conformation  .
