 ArgR has two domains : N-terminal domain , which contains a winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and C-terminal domain , which contains a motif that binds L-arginine and a motif for oligomerization . 
Based on cross-linking analysis of wild-type and mutant ArgR proteins , it has been shown that C-terminus is more important in cer/Xer site-specific recombination than in DNA binding  .
