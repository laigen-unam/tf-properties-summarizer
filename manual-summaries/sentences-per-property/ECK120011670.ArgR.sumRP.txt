ArgR complexed with L-arginine represses transcription of several genes involved in  biosynsis and transport of arginine , transport of histidine , and its own synsis and activates genes for arginine catabolism . 
ArgR is also essential for a site-specific recombination reaction that resolves plasmid ColE1 multimers to monomers and is necessary for plasmid stability  .
