 C-terminal domain of FliZ contains an α-helix that is similar to helix 3.0 of σS , and this structure promotes DNA binding . 
In FliZ , this α-helix contains a positively charged amino acid -LRB- R108 -RRB- that is involved in recognition of extended -10 promoter . 
This promoter includes a -10 hexamer and different elements located at -14 T / -13 C , -12 T , and -7 T . 
Based on mutational analyses , it was shown that upstream TC constitutes an extended -10 motif and is recognized by R108 -LRB- which recognizes both 14T and 13C -RRB- , a residue in α-helix of FliZ . 
DNA-binding N-terminal domains of recombinases and various phage integrases also have characteristics similar to DNA-binding domain of this regulator  .
