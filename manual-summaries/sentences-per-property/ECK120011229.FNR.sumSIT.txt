activated FNR conformation is able to bind  a specific  palindromic sequence of DNA  with consensus sequence TTGATNNNNATCAA  . 
FNR activates transcription from class I and class II promoters , in which  FNR-binding sites are located around -61 , -71 , -82 , or -92 in class I and around -41.5 in class II  .
