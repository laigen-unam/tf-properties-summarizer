CitB/DpiA is a dual transcriptional regulator involved in  anaerobic citrate catabolism . 
 In presence of citrate and under anaerobic conditions it activates genes for citrate fermentation  , citCDEFXGT operon ,  citAB operon  , and mdh , as well as exuTR operon for dissimilation of hexuronate . 
Due to ability of CitB/DpiA to bind to A/T-rich sequences , multiple or roles have been assigned to CitB . 
When overexpressed in E. coli , it destabilizes plasmid inheritance , represses transcription of appY , encoding a regulator of anaerobic metabolism , and induces SOS response by competing with DnaA and DnaB in binding to  A/T-rich sequences  at replication origin . 
Moreover , inactivation of penicillin-binding protein 3 , FtsI , eir chemically or genetically , induces SOS  in E. coli .
