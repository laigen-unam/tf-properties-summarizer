FadR , Fatty acid degradation Regulon is a multifunctional dual regulator that exerts negative control over  fatty acid degradative regulon and acetate metabolism whereas it is responsible for maximal expression of unsaturated fatty acid biosynsis . 
FadR coordinately regulates fatty acid biosynsis and fatty acid degradation at level of transcription . 
In this way , FadR functions as a switch between fatty acid Î²-oxidation and fatty acid biosynsis . 
FadR is a global regulator of lipid metabolism , as it activates multiple operons responsible for fatty acid synsis . 
FadR activates fabH promoter in absence of long-chain fatty acids  .
