 PhoB consists of two functional domains , N-terminal receiver domain , which is phosphorylated , and C-terminal output domain , which binds to DNA and interacts with ? 
70-subunit of RNA polymerase to activate transcription . 
crystal structure of a subcomplex , which includes ? 
4 domain of ? 
70 factor fused with RNAP ? 
- subunit flap tip helix , shows that ? 
4 domain is recruited to pho box promoters by PhoB and reorients ? 
4 domain with respect to its binding site . 
output domain belongs to winged helix-turn-helix family of transcription factors . 
 Its activity is silenced by receiver domain , and phosphorylation relieves inhibition   .
