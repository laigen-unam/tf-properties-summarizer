 DhaR  belongs to family of bacterial enhancer-binding proteins  which contain three domains : sensing domain located in N terminus , central AAA + domain , and C-terminal domain , which contains a helix-turn-helix motif involved in interaction with DNA . 
Although C-terminal domain and N-terminal domain from DhaR are similar to those of or members of this group , its central domain is not . 
central AAA + domain does not contain two conserved submotives in this family -LRB- ESELF and GAFTGA -RRB- responsible for interaction with σ54 . 
As with or members of family , possibility exists of that this regulator activates dependent promoters of σ70 instead of dependent promoters of σ54 . 
crystal structure has been determined . 
DhaR regulates transcription by coiled-coil helix rotation , and this provides mechanism for transmitting binding signal from GAF/PAS domains to C-terminal DNA-binding domain  .
