 FeaR  belongs to AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators  . 
This protein consists of two domains , an amino-terminal domain -LRB- NTD -RRB- involved in co-inducer recognition and dimerization and a carboxy-terminal domain -LRB- CTD -RRB- that contains a potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif . 
Activation by FeaR requires NTD , which could function as an inhibitor of CTD in absence of coactivator  .
