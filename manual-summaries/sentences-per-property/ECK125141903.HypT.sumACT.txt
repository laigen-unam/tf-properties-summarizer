 HypT is specifically activated by HOCl by methionine oxidation  , protecting cells from detrimental effects of HOCl -RRB- . 
Based on microarray analysis ,  HypT upregulates genes involved in  cysteine and methionine biosynsis and sulfur metabolism upon hypochlorite stress . 
On or hand , genes involved in iron acquisition and homeostasis upon hypochlorite stress are downregulated by YjiE   . 
 In presence of hypochlorite ,  HypT becomes active due to oxidation of three methionines -LRB- Met123 , Met206 , and Met230 -RRB- .
 Oxidation of HypT is reversed by presence of methionine sulfoxide reductases MsrA and MsrB , resulting in an inactive protein  .
