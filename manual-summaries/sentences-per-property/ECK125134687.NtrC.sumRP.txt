Under nitrogen -LRB- N -RRB- - limiting conditions , NtrC transcriptional dual regulator regulates genes involved in   assimilation of nitrogen and in minimization of slow growth caused by N-limited condition  . 
Through a cascade of events NtrC appears to regulate as much as 2 % of genome , and many of se genes encode transport systems for nitrogen-containing compounds  .
