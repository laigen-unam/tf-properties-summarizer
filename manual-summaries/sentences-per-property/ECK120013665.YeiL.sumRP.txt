genes that YeiL transcriptional activator regulates have not been identified yet , but it has been proposed that this protein might regulate genes involved in  post-exponential-phase nitrogen starvation . 
A gene encoding a potential nucleoside hydrolase  and transcribed divergently from yeiL has also been suggested to be subject to YeiL regulation .
