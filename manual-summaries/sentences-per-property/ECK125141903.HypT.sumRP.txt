HypT  belongs to LysR-type transcriptional regulator family  , which  protects cells from HOCl damage . 
It regulates several genes upon hypochlorite stress , which increases cellular viability by reducing intracellular iron levels . 
This assumes a primary role for HypT in downregulating iron acquisition genes in order to prevent furr synsis of iron uptake proteins  . 
Based on microarray analysis ,  HypT upregulates genes involved in  cysteine and methionine biosynsis and sulfur metabolism upon hypochlorite stress . 
On or hand , genes involved in iron acquisition and homeostasis upon hypochlorite stress are downregulated by YjiE   .
