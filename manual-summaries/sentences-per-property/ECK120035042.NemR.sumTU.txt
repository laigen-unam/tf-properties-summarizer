N-ethylmaleimide reductase repressor , represses nemA gene , which is involved in  reductive degradation of N-ethylmaleimide -LRB- NEM -RRB- and or toxic nitrous compounds  , and  it also represses its own expression  . 
It has been experimentally verified that methylglyoxal -LRB- MG -RRB- and not NEM is real inducer for  nemRA operon  .
