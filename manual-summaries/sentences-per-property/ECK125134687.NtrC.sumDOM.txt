  When NtrC is phosphorylated , dimer , which is inactive state of protein , is disrupted and ATPase domain is free to repack in front-to-back orientation to form a hexamer or octamer ring  . 
In this ring re is contact of receiver domain of one subunit with ATPase domain of a second one . 
NtrC has three domains : an N-terminal receiver domain that contains conserved Asp-54 residue that is phosphorylated a central ATP-binding AAA + that cleaves ATP to produce energy used in process of open complex formation , mediates a phosphorylation-dependent oligomerization , and interacts with RNA polymerase through highly conserved GAFTGA motif and a C-terminal domain , which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding and is involved in dimerization and in phosphorylation-independent oligomerization  .
