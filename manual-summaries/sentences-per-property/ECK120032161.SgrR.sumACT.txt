SugaR transport-related Regulator SgrR   is negatively autoregulated   and coordinately activates transcription of divergent operon . 
 As intracellular accumulation of  glucose-6-phosphate  correlates with SgrR induction  , it has been proposed as its inducer . 
 Autoregulation of SgrR is not affected by phosphosugar stress  .
