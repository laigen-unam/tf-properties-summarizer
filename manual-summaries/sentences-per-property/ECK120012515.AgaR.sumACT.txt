It   is negatively autoregulated   and coordinately represses transcription of divergent agaZVWEFA operon , which is related to transport and degradation of N-acetylgalactosamine . 
 This repressor responds to N-acetylgalactosamine and d-galactosamine in medium  . 
In accordance with or helix-turn-helix DNA-binding repressors ,  AgaR may bind to DNA as a tetramer  .
