 Binding of leucine can affect se activities in three different ways :  leucine  eir potentiates , antagonizes , or has no discernible effect upon Lrp action  . 
 In presence of leucine octamer configuration is favored  . 
 structure of Lrp from Escherichia coli bound to DNA as an octamer has been solved . 
Lrp forms an open ring structure , in which DNA is wrapped around octamer in a nucleosome-like structure  .
