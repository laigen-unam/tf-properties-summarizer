 Each monomer consists of three domains , an N-terminal DNA-binding domain carrying two helix-turn-helix motifs , a central dimerization domain , and a C-terminal metal-binding domain . 
DNA-binding and dimerization domains are  characteristic of MerR family of proteins  . 
dimerization domain contains a 10-turn Î±-helix that forms an antiparallel coiled-coil with helix of or monomer . 
metal-binding domain contains an unusual metal receptor site in which bound metal is inaccessible to solvent . 
metal ion is bound with a linear coordination to two conserved cysteine residues  .
