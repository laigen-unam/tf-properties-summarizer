transcription factor FhlA , for Formate hydrogen lyase Activator ,  is positively autoregulated  and controls transcription of operons involved in  formate metabolism to produce dihydrogen and carbon dioxide  . 
 Transcription of this operon is induced when E. coli is grown under anaerobic growth conditions and when physiological inducer , formate , binds to FhlA protein  . 
  When formate binds to FhlA , protein becomes active  as binding affinity of FhlA increases  , and it activates transcription of Ïƒ54-dependent promoters . 
 HycA may inactivate function of FhlA protein and prevent binding of FhlA to target sequences  , but mechanism of negative regulation by HycA is unknown . 
 FhlA is subject to posttranscriptional regulation by sRNA OxyS  .
