 SoxR contains two essential -LSB- 2Fe-2S -RSB- clusters for its transcriptional activity . 
Each SoxR polypeptide contains a -LSB- 2Fe-2S -RSB- cluster that senses oxidants in cell  . 
 metal core structural and redox states of metal active sites of SoxR in presence and absence of O2 and/or NO have been determined  .
