 Under anaerobic conditions ArcA is phosphorylated in a phosphorelay reaction that involves phosphotransfer from the autophosphorylated transmitter domain of ArcB to the receiver and Hpt domain of ArcB and finally to the receiver domain of ArcA  . 
 ArcA is a member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily of response regulators  and  consists of an N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain  .
