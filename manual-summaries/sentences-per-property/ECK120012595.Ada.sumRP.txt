transcription factor Ada , for Adaptive response to alkylation damage ,  is positively autoregulated  and controls transcription of genes involved in  process of reparation of alkylated DNA  also called adaptive response O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine are major mutagenic lesions resulting from exposure of DNA to simple alkylating agents such as N-methyl-N ' - nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine -LRB- MNNG -RRB- , N-methyl-N-nitrosourea -LRB- MNU -RRB- and , to a lesser degree , methane methanesulfonate -LRB- MMS -RRB- . 
This regulator  removes methyl groups -LRB- as well as larger groups -RRB- from guanine and thymine substrates and transfers m to its own cysteine residue -LRB- Cys-321 -RRB- in C-terminal domain . 
Ada protein also transfers methyl groups to a second cysteine residue -LRB- Cys-69 -RRB- in N-terminal domain , from alkylphosphotriesters in DNA   .
