In presence of proline , PutA is associated with cytoplasmic membrane and acts a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing both reactions of  proline degradation pathway : oxidation of proline by proline dehydrogenase and subsequent oxidation to glutamate by pyrroline-5-carboxylate -LRB- P5C -RRB- dehydrogenase  .
