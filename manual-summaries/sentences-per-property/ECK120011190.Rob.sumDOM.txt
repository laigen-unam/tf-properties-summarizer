 Rob consists of two domains and belongs to AraC/XylS family . 
N-terminal domain is DNA-binding domain and is homologous to MarA and SoxS and C-terminal domain of AraC . 
It carries two helix-turn-helix -LRB- HTH -RRB- motifs for DNA binding . 
One of m , located in N-terminal region , interacts with element RE1 of Mar-Sox-Rob box , and HTH located in C-terminal region interacts with RE2 . 
In case of Rob , it appears that only one of two HTH motifs makes base-specific contacts with DNA  .
