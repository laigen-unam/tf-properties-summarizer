 specific inducer for BirA is biotinyl-5 ' - adenylate -LRB- bio-5 ' - AMP -RRB-  . 
 In presence of bio-5 ' - AMP ,  BirA binds to  40-nucleotide-long  DNA target sites in bioA/bioBFCD intergenic region   to coordinately repress transcription of bioAp and bioBp . 
 effector bio-5 ' - AMP  is also a substrate in BirA-mediated biotinylation of biotin carboxyl carrier protein monomer -LRB- apoBCCP -RRB- , and this relationship results in repression of biotin operon when abundance of apoBCCP -LRB- and refore cellular demand for biotin -RRB- is reduced . 
 This repression is controlled by rate of competing protein : protein interaction  .
