It also regulates transcription of many or genes that participate in a variety of cellular functions , including genes involved in following processes or responses :  biogenesis of flagella transcription control of type I fimbria structural genes acid resistance functional glutamic acid-dependent system osmotically inducible genes glutamate decarboxylase-dependent acid resistance system osmotic control type II secretion pathway carbon sources genes involved in RNA component of small subunit -LRB- 30S subunit -RRB- and proteases among ors . 
It has also been shown to be involved in survival during stationary phase  , conferring to bacteria a growth advantage during stationary phase -LRB- GASP -RRB- .
