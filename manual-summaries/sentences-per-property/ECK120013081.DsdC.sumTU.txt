 In presence of d-serine , D-serine deaminase protein , DsdC , activates transcription of genes  involved in  d-serine detoxification  , and in  absence of metabolite it is autorepressed  . 
 dsbC gene is located next to an operon -LRB- dsdXA -RRB- regulated by DsbC  , but facing in opposite direction .
