 Like or members of this family , it has an N-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix -LRB- HTH -RRB- motif for DNA binding and a C-terminal domain for dimerization , inducer binding and protein contact with CRP . 
Between se two domains , CytR has a disordered sequence that provides HTH motif with freedom of movement , which would allow this protein to interact with octameric half DNA-binding sites that could be arranged as inverted or direct repeats and with different lengths of spacer regions . 
This interdomain linker is protected from proteolytic digestion in presence of CRP  .
