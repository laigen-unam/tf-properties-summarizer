transcriptional activator GadX , for Glutamic acid decarboxylase ,  is positively autoregulated  and controls transcription of pH-inducible genes , including principal acid resistance system is glutamate dependent -LRB- GAD -RRB- , is also referred to as GAD system , and its genes are involved in  multidrug efflux  . 
Trucker et al. provided evidence that  GadW can work as a coactivator of GadX or it can inhibit GadX-dependent activation  , along with evidence of more target genes for GadX/GadW regulation .
