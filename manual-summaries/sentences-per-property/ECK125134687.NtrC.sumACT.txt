Under nitrogen -LRB- N -RRB- - limiting conditions , NtrC transcriptional dual regulator regulates genes involved in   assimilation of nitrogen and in minimization of slow growth caused by N-limited condition  . 
 NtrB functions as a membrane-associated protein kinase that in response to limitation of N and carbon-limited growth is autophosphorylated  . 
On or hand ,  NtrC is sometimes autophosphorylated with small-molecule phospho donors  . 
  In presence of N , GlnB protein -LRB- also called PII -RRB- or GlnK protein binds to NtrB to activate its phosphatase activity   . 
  When NtrC is phosphorylated , dimer , which is inactive state of protein , is disrupted and ATPase domain is free to repack in front-to-back orientation to form a hexamer or octamer ring  .
