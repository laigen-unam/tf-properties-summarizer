n , phosphorylated   UhpB transfers phosphate group to UhpA in Asp-54 to activate it  . 
UhpB unphosphorylated is able to dephosphorylate to UhpA . 
UhpA has two modules : receiver module , which contains putative site of phosphorylation in N-terminal domain and activation module , which contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding in C-terminal domain  .
