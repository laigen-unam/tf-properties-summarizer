 members of this family have three domains : an N-terminal domain with a helix-turn-helix motif , which binds to DNA ; a central domain for dimerization and metal ion binding ; and a C-terminal alpha-spectrin SH3-like domain . 
However , MntR lacks SH3-like domain . 
3D structure of apo-MntR has been solved . 
protein dimerizes via its C-terminal domain . 
N-terminal and C-terminal domains are connected by a long Î±-helical linker . 
N-terminal domain is expected to bind two manganese ions per monomer , in analogy to BsMntR from B. subtilis , which has been crystallized with and without bound manganese . 
All residues involved in manganese binding in BsMntR ar conserved in MntR  .
