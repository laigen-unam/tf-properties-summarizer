These three proteins  belong to the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators  and as with other members of this family  they have two helix-turn-helix -LRB- HTH -RRB- motifs for DNA binding , one of them , located in the N-terminal region , interacts with the element RE1 of the mar box , and the HTH located in the C-terminal region interacts with the element RE2  .
