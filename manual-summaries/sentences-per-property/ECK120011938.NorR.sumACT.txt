 Under anaerobic and microaerobic conditions it activates transcription of norVW operon  , encoding  a nitric oxide -LRB- NO -RRB- - reducing flavorubredoxin that detoxifies NO  . 
 In absence of NO , activity of central catalytic AAA + domain of NorR is repressed by direct interaction between GAF domain and σ54-interacting region of AAA + domain . 
This interaction prevents access to σ54-RNA polymerase complex . 
Binding of NO relieves intramolecular repression and activates ATPase activity of central AAA + domain  .
