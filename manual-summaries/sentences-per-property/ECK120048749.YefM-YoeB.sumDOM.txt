 In complex , one C terminus in YefM homodimer is unfolded and or one shows an Î±-helical conformation and conceals endoribonuclease fold of YoeB . 
Two N-terminal segments of YefM form a symmetrical dimer within YefM2-YoeB heterotrimeric complex and do not contact YoeB directly . 
YefM does not possess a canonical DNA-binding motif , but instead a pair of basic residues , R10 and R31 , conserved in many YefM homologs are absolutely necessary for DNA binding by YefM-YoeB complex  .
