 StpA consists of two structured domains which are separated by a protease-sensitive linker . 
N-terminal domain is involved in protein-protein interaction , while purified C-terminal domain alone promotes annealing of RNA oligonucleotides and trans-splicing in vitro . 
Repression of bglG operon by StpA occurs as a molecular adapter and only in presence of N-terminal H-NS protein domain , which comprises core for dimerization  .
