Rob , MarA , and SoxS bind as monomers to same DNA site ,  a  degenerate  20-bp sequence   known as Mar-Sox-Rob box  , which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to -35 and -10 boxes of promoter . 
 Mar-Sox-Rob box contains an invariant A at position 1 , two recognition elements , RE1 at position 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18 , and a 7-bp A/T-rich spacer separating se elements  .
