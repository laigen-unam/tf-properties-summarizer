 This protein consists of two functional domains , the N-terminal receiver domain , which is phosphorylated , and the C-terminal output domain , which binds to DNA and interacts with the Ïƒ70 subunit of RNA polymerase to activate transcription . 
The output domain belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix family of transcription factors . 
Its activity is silenced by the receiver domain , and phosphorylation relieves inhibition  .
