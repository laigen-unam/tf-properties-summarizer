CspA acts as a positive transcription factor of at least two  cold shock  genes : hns and gyrA cspA has been shown to  negatively regulate its own expression  as result of attenuation of transcription . 
On or hand , Jiang et al. in 1997 demonstrated that CspA acts as an  RNA chaperone  that prevents secondary structure formation of RNA at low temperatures cspA mRNA is very unstable at 37 Â°C and rapidly disappears as cell density and RNase activity increase .
