Currently ,  no inducer for this regulator has been reported in literature  , although Reush et al. proposed that this regulator can form a complex with a short chain of polyhydroxybutyrate . 
For this reason ,  in absence of H-NS StpA protein is rapidly degraded in a Lon protease-dependent manner  protection from proteolytic degradation appears to be mediated by a direct interaction between StpA and H-NS .
