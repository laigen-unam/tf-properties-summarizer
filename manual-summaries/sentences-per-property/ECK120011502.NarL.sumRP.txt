NarL , nitrate/nitrite response regulator NarL , is a transcriptional dual regulator of many  anaerobic electron transport and fermentation-related genes in response to availability of high concentrations of nitrate or nitrite . 
NarL activates expression of 51 operons in response to nitrate , mostly genes needed for nitrate respiration . 
NarL represses 41 operons involved in alternative respiratory pathways , such as fumarate reduction or fermentation of simple sugars  .
