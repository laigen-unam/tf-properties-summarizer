 NemR contains five Cys residues , at positions 70 , 78 , 88 , 121 , and 125 , in a total of 199 residues . 
In some of se residues , NemR is controlled by alkylation . 
On or hand , Lee et al. -LRB- 2013 -RRB- reported that NemR contains six cysteines located at residue positions 21 , 98 , 106 , 116 , 149 , and 153 . 
critical Cys residue -LRB- s -RRB- involved in NemR activity control remains to be identified . 
However , cysteines at positions 21 and 116 have been determined as essential in sensing electrophiles in vivo and in vitro . 
Cys-106 residue , which is conserved among NemR homologs , has been identified as a trigger for NemR RCS-sensing mechanism  .
