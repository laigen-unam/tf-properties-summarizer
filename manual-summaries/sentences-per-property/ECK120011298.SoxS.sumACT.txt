The activity of each protein is induced by different signals : the activity of Rob is increased with dipyridyl , bile salts , or decanoate and  the activities of MarA and SoxS are increased by the aromatic weak acid salicylate and oxidative stress respectively  . 
 SoxS , MarA , and Rob bind as monomers to the same DNA site  , a  degenerate  20-bp sequence  known as the Mar-Sox-Rob box , which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the -35 and -10 boxes of the promoter  .
