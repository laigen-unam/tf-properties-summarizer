transcriptional repressor FliZ controls transcription of genes involved in regulation of  curli expression and motility system  . 
Transcriptome expression analysis showed a global antagonistic effect between FliZ and ÏƒS that resulted in physiological traits , including  flagellum-mediated motility and curli fimbria-mediated adhesion  .
