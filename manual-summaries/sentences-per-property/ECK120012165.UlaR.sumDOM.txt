UlaR transcriptional repressor  belongs to DeoR family  , and accordingly ,  this transcriptional repressor family protein is composed of two domains : an N-terminal HTH domain -LRB- residues 1-62 -RRB- , which contains DNA-binding region and C-terminal sugar-phosphate-binding domain -LRB- residues 69-251 -RRB- , which is responsible for dimerization and inducer binding . 
C-terminal sugar-phosphate-binding domain belongs to DeoR-C family of ISOCOT superfamily and is structurally related to E. coli D-ribose-5-P isomerase . 
Asp206 and Lys209 are directly involved in binding L-ascorbate-6-P  .
