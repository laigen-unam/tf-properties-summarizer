 PaaX  contains a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding that is similar to motif found in N terminal of members of GntR family of transcriptional regulators  . 
Members of this family share similar N-terminal DNA-binding domains but are classified into four subfamilies according to ir divergence in ir C-terminal domains , which are involved in effector binding and oligomerization  .
