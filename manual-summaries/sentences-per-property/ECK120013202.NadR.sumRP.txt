Initially thought to only function as a transcriptional regulator that represses genes involved in  transport and de novo synsis of NAD , NadR was later shown to have nicotinamide mononucleotide -LRB- NMN -RRB- adenylyltransferase activity and predicted to have ribosylnicotinamide kinase activity  .
