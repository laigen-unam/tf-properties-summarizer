Leblanc et al. identified  two flavonoids and also sodium tungstate as novel inducers to BaeSR  . 
As a consequence of this sensing , BaeS is autophosphorylated , followed by  transfer of phosphate group to BaeR which is converted to an active form  that appears to recognize and bind a  DNA sequence with a direct repeat symmetry  .
