 RclR contains two conserved cysteine residues -LRB- Cys-21 and Cys-89 -RRB- and two conserved histidine residues -LRB- His-42 and His-75 -RRB- . 
Cys-21 and Cys-89 are important in activation of RclR in vivo . 
Cys-21 could play more critical role in RclR redox response . 
Oxidation of both cysteines leads to strong , highly specific activation of expression of genes required for survival under RCS stress . 
His residues are involved in preventing DNA binding when RclR levels are reduced  .
