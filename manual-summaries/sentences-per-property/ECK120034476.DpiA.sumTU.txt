 In presence of citrate and under anaerobic conditions it activates genes for citrate fermentation  , citCDEFXGT operon ,  citAB operon  , and mdh , as well as exuTR operon for dissimilation of hexuronate . 
 operon containing both genes , citB -LRB- dpiA -RRB- , encoding response regulator , and citA -LRB- dpiB -RRB-  , encoding sensor kinase , is transcribed divergently to citCDEFXGT operon .
