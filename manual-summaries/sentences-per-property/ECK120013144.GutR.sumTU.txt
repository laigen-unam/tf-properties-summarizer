 This regulator is located in unusual gut operon  , which contains two glucitol-specific transcription factors , GutR and GutM ,  that regulate this operon negatively and positively  , respectively ; both regulators control transcription of glucitol PTS permease . 
 Expression of gutR is activated in presence of glucitol and in absence of glucose  .
