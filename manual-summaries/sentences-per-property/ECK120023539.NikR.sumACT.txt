 nickel ion is bound in a four-coordinate planar conformation to NikR in solution and in a six-coordinate conformation to NikR bound to DNA  . 
Molecular simulations on EcNikR structure suggest that  binding of NikR to DNA is more favorable when NikR contains K +  and allosterically activated DNA-binding conformation of NikR is stabilized by K + . 
Moreover ,  DNA binding of NikR is abolished in absence of K +  .
