CadC is a metal-sensitive transcriptional activator that regulates expression of genes involved in  cadaverine synsis and excretion   under low external pH and high concentrations of lysine  . 
  In absence of lysine , LysP regulates CadC negatively  . 
Based on site-directed mutagenesis  ,  Asp275 and Asp278 in LysP and Arg265 and Arg268 in CadC were identified as residues for stimulus-dependent interaction between m  . 
 LysP and CadC interact most strongly at pH7 .6 and at lysine concentrations of 1 ÂµM or less  , that is , under non-Cad-inducing conditions . 
 LysP-CadC interaction is mediated via trans-membrane and periplasmic contacts  .
