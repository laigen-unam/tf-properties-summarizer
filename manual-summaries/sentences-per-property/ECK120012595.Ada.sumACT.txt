transcription factor Ada , for Adaptive response to alkylation damage ,  is positively autoregulated  and controls transcription of genes involved in  process of reparation of alkylated DNA  also called adaptive response O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine are major mutagenic lesions resulting from exposure of DNA to simple alkylating agents such as N-methyl-N ' - nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine -LRB- MNNG -RRB- , N-methyl-N-nitrosourea -LRB- MNU -RRB- and , to a lesser degree , methane methanesulfonate -LRB- MMS -RRB- .
