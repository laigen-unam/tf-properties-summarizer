 OxyR consists of two domains , N-terminal domain , carrying a helix-turn-helix motif , and C-terminal regulatory domain . 
A flexible linker connects both domains . 
C-terminal domain contains determinants for oligomerization and two redox-active cysteines , Cys199 and Cys208 . 
OxyR functions as a reversible cellular redox switch . 
 In presence of 100 nM H2O2 , activation occurs by formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys199 and Cys208   .
