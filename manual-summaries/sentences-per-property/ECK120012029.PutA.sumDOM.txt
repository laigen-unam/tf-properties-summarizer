 N-terminal 47 residues with a ribbon-helix-helix fold contain dimerization domain and specific DNA-binding activity of PutA . 
Lys9 residue is essential for recognition of put promoter DNA  . 
 proline dehydrogenase activity resides in amino-terminal 669 amino acids of PutA ;  a truncated protein retains proline dehydrogenase and DNA-binding activity but lacks membrane association and 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase activity . 
 Parts of C-terminal domain may function as a lid that covers internal substrate-channeling cavity  .
