transcription factor SdiA , for Suppressor of cell division inhibitor ,  is possibly positively autoregulated  and controls transcription of genes involved in  cell division . 
 Expression of sdiA itself is regulated by a mechanism similar to quorum sensing  : exposure to conditioned medium results in a 50-80 % decrease in sdiA expression .
