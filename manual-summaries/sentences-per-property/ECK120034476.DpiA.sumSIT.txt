When overexpressed in E. coli , it destabilizes plasmid inheritance , represses transcription of appY , encoding a regulator of anaerobic metabolism , and induces SOS response by competing with DnaA and DnaB in binding to  A/T-rich sequences  at replication origin . 
CitB/DpiA binds to  sequences with a very high A + T content  .
