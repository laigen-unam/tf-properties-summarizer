MurR is a  member of RpiR/AlsR family of transcriptional regulators  ,  whose members contain two domains , a highly conserved N-terminal HTH domain and a C-terminal SIS -LRB- sugar phosphate isomerase/sugar phosphate-binding -RRB- domain  . 
 MurR carries a so-called SIS domain in its C terminal which is involved in MurNAc-6-P binding  .
