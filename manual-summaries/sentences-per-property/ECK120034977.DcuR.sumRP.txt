DcuR regulates several genes involved in  C4-dicarboxylate metabolism . 
In addition , a recent microarray-based global transcriptional profiling study suggested that DcuR regulon could comprise at least 39 genes , including some involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynsis and some involved in anaerobic nitrate and nitrite respiration  .
