 glycolytic flux is determined by concentration of  metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate , which is molecular effector of Cra   . 
 In presence of glucose it increases intracellular concentration of metabolites d-fructose 1-phosphate and d-fructose 1,6-phosphate  , which interact with FruR to prevent its binding or displacement of target operons . 
 FruR is inactivated upon interaction of inducers  .
