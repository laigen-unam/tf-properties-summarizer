 This transcription factor is composed of two domains , a C-terminal domain that contains two potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs and an N-terminal domain involved in l-rhamnose binding and dimerization of protein . 
Mutational studies carried out to define interactions between RhaS and σ70 suggest existence of two interaction regions in both . 
contact regions through which both proteins interact are represented by two amino acid residues in C-terminal domains of RhaS -LRB- D241 and D250 -RRB- and σ70 -LRB- R599 and K593 -RRB-  .
