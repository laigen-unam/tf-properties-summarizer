 NarP consists of N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain . 
receiver domain of NarL and NarP could function as a stabilizer of carboxyl-terminal domain -LRB- CTD -RRB- ; it enhances DNA binding and/or enables repression per se in vivo . 
In addition , receiver may make protein-protein contacts necessary for transcription activation  .
