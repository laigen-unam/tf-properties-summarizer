 During activation , three activating regions -LRB- AR -RRB- are surface exposed for contact with polymerase and promote transcription . 
AR1 region contacts with α subunit , AR2 region makes contact with σ70 , and AR3 contacts α NTD of RNA polymerase . 
group amino acids Thr-118 with Ser-187 ; Lys-49 with Lys50 ; and Asp86 and Ile81 with Gly-85 are important for AR1 , AR2 , and AR3 , respectively , to make contact with RNA polymerase . 
monomer in FNR dimer that makes contact with RNA polymerase and activating region in FNR that makes contact depends on class of promoter , class I or class II . 
FNR  belongs to CRP/FNR superfamily of transcription factors  whose members are widely distributed in bacteria . 
se proteins have an N-terminal sensory domain , a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain , and a dimerization motif in between . 
sensory domain of FNR contains five cysteine residues , four of which are essential for linking -LSB- 4Fe-4S -RSB- cluster  .
