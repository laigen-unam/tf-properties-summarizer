 MetJ as a homodimer recognizes and binds  to an   8-bp DNA sequence  called met-box , which varies around a perfect palindromic consensus sequence  . 
 In addition to AdoMet , metabolites 5 ' - deoxy-5 ' - -LRB- methylthio -RRB- adenosine -LRB- MTA -RRB- and adenine -LRB- Ade -RRB- also bind with high affinity to MetJ  , but biological effects of this binding are not known .
