cellular concentration of FNR is similar under both anaerobic and aerobic growth , but  its activity is regulated directly by oxygen  . 
 Under anaerobiosis , FNR acquires a -LSB- 4Fe-4S -RSB- cluster that causes a conformational change and dimerization of protein that causes it to become activated  . 
 After prolonged O2 exposure , -LSB- 2Fe-2S -RSB- cluster is destroyed , and apo-FNR , which lacks an Fe-S cluster , is primary form of FNR under aerobiosis  . 
 Nitric oxide -LRB- NO -RRB- is also able to inactivate FNR through nitrosylation of -LSB- 4Fe-4S -RSB- cluster  , although NO is sensed by or transcription factors , and FNR appears only to function as a final safeguard against NO damage .
