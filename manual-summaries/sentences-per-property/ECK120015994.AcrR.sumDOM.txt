 crystal structure of AcrR shows that this protein is folded into nine Î±-helices distributed in two domains : DNA-binding domain , which forms typical helix-turn-helix in N-terminal domain , and ligand-binding domain , which forms a large internal cavity for multidrug binding in C-terminal domain . 
Mutational analyses have been used to identify critical role of some amino acids for AcrR activity , such as Glu-67 and Arg-45  .
