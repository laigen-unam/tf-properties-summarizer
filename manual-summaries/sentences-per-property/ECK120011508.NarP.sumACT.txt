 In absence of nitrate and nitrite , NarX and NarQ stimulate dephosphorylation of NarL-P and NarP-P  . 
This reaction is specific , that is ,  NarP-P is only dephosphorylated by NarQ  . 
 In presence of nitrate or nitrite NarL or NarP binds to a target site upstream of binding sites for FNR , IHF , and Fis  , counteracting effect of IHF but not that of Fis .
