This regulator activates the transcription of the psp regulon , and  it is negatively autoregulated and coordinately activated by transcription of the divergent operon psp  . 
 The activity of PspF is inhibited by PspA  , which is an accessory protein that binds directly to PspF to inhibit transcription of the psp regulon . 
  PspA inhibits PspF activity by direct interaction of the AAA + transcription activation domain of PspF  .
