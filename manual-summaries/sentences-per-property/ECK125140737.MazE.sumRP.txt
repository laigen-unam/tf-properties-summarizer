MazF exhibits  ribonuclease activity toward single stranded RNA regions of sequence ACA , and resulting degradation of cellular mRNA causes global translation inhibition . 
MazF exhibits RNase activity toward tmRNA , and tmRNA is involved in release of MazF-mediated cell growth inhibition . 
mazEF system causes a programmed cell death response to stresses including starvation and antibiotics  . 
MazE-MazF system mediates  toxicity of guanosine 3 ' ,5 ' - bispyrophosphate -LRB- rapid relA induction -RRB- , which is associated with amino acid deprivation ; cell death caused by antibiotics rifampicin , chloramphenicol , and spectinomycin ; and thymineless death -LRB- TLD -RRB- response to thymine starvation  .
