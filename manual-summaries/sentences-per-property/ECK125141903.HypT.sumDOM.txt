 HypT has five cysteine residues which contribute to control DNA-binding activity of HypT in vitro . 
Cys150 is required for stability , Cys4 is important for oligomerization of HypT to dodecamers , and Cys4 oxidation may be a checkpoint in activation process of HypT  . 
 In presence of hypochlorite ,  HypT becomes active due to oxidation of three methionines -LRB- Met123 , Met206 , and Met230 -RRB-  .
