transcriptional activator FUR , for Ferric Uptake Regulation , is capable of controlling its own synsis and controls transcription of genes involved in  iron homeostasis and a minor sigma factor that initiates transcription of ferric citrate transport genes in response to presence of periplasmic iron -LRB- III -RRB- dicitrate . 
This regulator also participates in regulation of transcription of many or genes involved in different cellular functions , including following : flagellum chemotaxis methionine biosynsis acid and oxidative stresses metal ion stress resistance to cobalt and nickel tricarboxylic acid cycle glycolysis and gluconeogenesis respiration porins purine metabolism 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate biosynsis and phage DNA packaging . 
Based on transcriptome analysis , expression levels of a set of genes regulated by Fur change substantially in response to antibiotic treatment . 
Iron homeostasis influences evolution of ciprofloxacin resistance  .
