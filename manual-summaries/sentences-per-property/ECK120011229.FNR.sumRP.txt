FNR is primary transcriptional regulator that mediates  transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth through regulation of hundreds of genes . 
Generally , this protein activates genes involved in anaerobic metabolism and represses genes involved in aerobic metabolism . 
FNR also regulates transcription of many genes with or functions , such as acid resistance , chemotaxis , cell structure , and molecular biosynsis  , among ors .
