SoxS , MarA , and Rob  belong to the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators  and , like other members of this family ,  they have two helix-turn-helix -LRB- HTH -RRB- motifs for DNA binding : one of them , located in the N-terminal region , interacts with the element RE1 of the Mar-Sox-Rob box , and the HTH located in the C-terminal region interacts with the element RE2  .
