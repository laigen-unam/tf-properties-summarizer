These proteins activate a common set of about 50 target genes  the marA/soxS/rob regulon  , involved in  antibiotic resistance superoxide resistance and tolerance to organic solvents and heavy metals  . 
 soxS is divergently transcribed from soxR  . 
 SoxR is the transcriptional activator for soxS and a sensor for superoxide and nitric oxide through its -LSB- 2Fe-2S -RSB- center . 
It activates soxS transcription when oxidized soxS is regulated only by its intracellular concentration  .
