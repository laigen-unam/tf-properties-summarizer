OxyR regulon includes genes involved in  peroxide metabolism , redox balance , and peroxide protection by , for example , manganese uptake . 
Moreover , OxyR activates synsis of small , noncoding oxyS RNA  . 
Based on microarray assays , a new function as regulator of  S-nitrosylation  -LRB- a nitrosative stress regulon -RRB- under anaerobic conditions has been determined for OxyR and it is distinct from OxyR regulon activated by oxidative stress .
