RtcR  belongs to group of σ54-dependent transcriptional regulators  , which  contain three domains : sensory domain located in N terminus , central domain involved in ATP hydrolysis and interaction with σ54 , and C-terminal domain , which contains a helix-turn-helix motif . 
Although C-terminal domain and central domain from RtcR are similar to those of or members of this group , its N-terminal domain is not  .
