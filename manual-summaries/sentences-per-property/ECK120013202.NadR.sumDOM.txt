 NadR is composed of three different domains : an N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain for DNA binding , a central NMN adenylyltransferase domain that contains an ATP-binding site , and a C-terminal ribosylnicotinamide kinase domain . 
NadR is often found to be mutated in long-term evolution experiments ; interestingly , mutations are usually only found in N - and C-terminal domains  .
