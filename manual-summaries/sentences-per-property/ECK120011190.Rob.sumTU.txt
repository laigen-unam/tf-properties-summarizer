Rob , MarA , and SoxS bind as monomers to same DNA site ,  a  degenerate  20-bp sequence   known as Mar-Sox-Rob box  , which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to -35 and -10 boxes of promoter . 
 rob expression is enhanced at stationary phase and under glucose and phosphate starvation  , and  it was suggested that expression of rob is ÏƒS dependent  .
