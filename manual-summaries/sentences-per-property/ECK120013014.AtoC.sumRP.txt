It inhibits posttranslationally  ornithine decarboxylase -LRB- ODC -RRB- which is a key enzyme for biosynsis of polyamines which are essential components for cellular growth and proliferation . 
On or hand ,  in presence of acetoacetate , AtoC regulates transcription of atoDAEB operon  whose products are involved in catabolism of short-chain fatty acids . 
However , transcriptome analyses have shown that this protein not only regulates this operon but also upregulates or downregulates 11 and 32 genes , respectively , that are involved in flagellar synsis . 
On or hand , phenotypical analysis with an AtoS mutant showed reduced motility , sodium chloride sensitivity , and increased susceptibility to membrane-acting agents and an aminoglycoside antibiotic . 
AtoSC is involved in flagellar regulon , controlling motility and chemotaxis responses . 
Through atoDAEB operon regulation , AtoC modules positively biosynsis and intracellular distribution of poly - -LRB- R -RRB- -3-hydroxybutyrate -LRB- cPHB -RRB-  , a biopolymer with many physiological roles .
