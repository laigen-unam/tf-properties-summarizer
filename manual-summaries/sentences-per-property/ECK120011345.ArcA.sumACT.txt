 It acts primarily as a negative transcriptional regulator under anaerobic conditions  . 
It has been suggested that  the most significant role of ArcA is under microaerobic conditions  , while that of FNR is under more strictly anaerobic conditions . 
ArcA is a response regulator and  is activated as a DNA-binding protein by phosphorylation  . 
It has been suggested that  multimerization , induced by phosphorylation , is a prerequisite for binding  .
