 FadR appears to be a two-domain dimeric molecule in which N-terminal domains bind to DNA , whereas C-terminal domain binds fatty acyl coenzyme A -LRB- acyl-CoA -RRB- . 
In addition , re is a linker that connects both N-terminal and C-terminal . 
FadR binds DNA as an apo-protein , and it is released when it binds long-chain acyl-CoA . 
binding of acyl-CoA disrupts a buried network of charged and polar residues in C-terminal domain , and resulting conformational change is transmitted to N-terminal domain via a domain-spanning α-helix CoA in this way re is loss of DNA binding since acyl-CoA regulates DNA binding by FadR . 
α/β N-terminal domain -LRB- α1-β1-α2-α3-β2-β3 -RRB- has a winged-helix motif , and α-helical C-terminal domain -LRB- α6-α7-α8-α9-α10-α11-α12 -RRB- resembles sensor domain of Tet repressor and PAS domain , in particular photoactive yellow protein and finally linker comprising two short α-helices -LRB- α4-α5 -RRB- . 
binding of FadR to DNA is determined by localization of α3 recognition helices that are paired toger at dimer interface . 
DNA-binding domain is very highly conserved among FadR-containing bacteria , whereas C-terminal acyl-CoA-binding domain shows only weak conservation  .
