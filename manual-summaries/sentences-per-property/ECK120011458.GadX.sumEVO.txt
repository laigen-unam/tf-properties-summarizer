 This operon encodes two transcriptional regulators , GadX and GadW  , both of which are  members of AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators  . 
 GadX is highly homologous to GadW -LRB- 42 % -RRB-  , and apparently both are capable of cross talk to regulate expression of genes of this system . 
As a member of AraC/XylS family ,  this transcription factor is composed of two domains : C-terminal domain  -LRB- 60 % homologous to C terminal of GadW -RRB-  , which contains two potential helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs in DNA-binding region , and amino-terminal domain -LRB-  30 % homologous to N terminal of GadW  -RRB- , which is responsible for dimerization  .
