PhoP  belongs to OmpR/PhoB subfamily of response regulators   characterized by a winged-helix DNA-binding domain . 
structure of N-terminal receiver domain has been solved in absence and presence of phosphoryl analog beryllofluoride  . 
 C-terminal domain of σ subunit -LRB- σ CTD -RRB- is required for recruitment of RNA polymerase  .
