 It is composed of two domains . 
solution structure of C-terminal DNA-binding domain has been solved . 
It consists of two helix-turn-helix regions connected by an α-helix . 
N-terminal domain is responsible for dimerization and L-arabinose binding . 
Its crystal structure reveals that sugar molecule is bound within a β-barrel , buried by N-terminal arm of protein . 
It has been suggested that this N-terminal arm plays a key role in regulation of arabinose-dependent DNA-binding properties of protein . 
 In absence of arabinose it interacts with DNA-binding domain and constrains this domain , and it releases it in presence of arabinose  . 
This interaction appears to be affected by a mutation in interdomain linker . 
Mutations at position 15 in N-terminal arm of AraC do not activate transcription in presence of arabinose , and this was confirmed by using a molecular dynamic -LRB- MD -RRB- simulation , which revealed that preservation of shape of arm is critical to inducibility  .
