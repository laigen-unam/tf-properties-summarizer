Zur , which  belongs to Fur family  ,  appears to have a DNA-binding site in N-terminal domain , around residue 65 , and a signal-recognition site in C-terminal domain . 
This protein has two Zn -LRB- II -RRB- - binding sites : site A , which only binds to Zn -LRB- II -RRB- , and site B -LRB- sensor site -RRB- , which binds to Zn -LRB- II -RRB- and Co -LRB- II -RRB- with high and low affinities , respectively  .
