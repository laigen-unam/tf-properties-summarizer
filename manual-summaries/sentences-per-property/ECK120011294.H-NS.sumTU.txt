H-NS plays an important role in regulation of many genes in response to environmental changes and adaptation to stress ; refore ,  it is capable of controlling its own synsis  . 
At transcription level ,  hns is autoregulated  , and it is controlled by different transcription factors . 
 hns is induced by high hydrostatic pressure and DNA synsis  .
