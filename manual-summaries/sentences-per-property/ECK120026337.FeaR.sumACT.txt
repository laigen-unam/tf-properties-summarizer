 This regulator is regulated by catabolic repression  , and highly expressed in presence of succinate . 
 It is induced by tyramine , and in absence of glucose , it activates expression of amine oxidase and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase  , proteins involved in 2-phenylethylamine catabolism  . 
Although it has not been possible to test ligand binding to FeaR , se data and those of ors suggest that it is a substrate or intermediate of TynA/FeaB pathway , as it is more likely that  an aldehyde -LRB- tyramine -RRB- is direct inducer for PEA catabolic pathway and a likely coeffector of FeaR  .
