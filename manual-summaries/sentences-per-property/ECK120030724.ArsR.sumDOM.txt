 ArsR has a helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding , a metal-binding site and a dimerization domain . 
inducer-binding sites for members of this family appear to have arisen by convergent evolution . 
In ArsR inducer-binding site contains three cysteine residues that bind  arsenite and antimonite  specifically and with high affinity  .
