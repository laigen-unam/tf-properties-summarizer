Maltose inhibitor , MalI , is a repressor that controls genes related to  maltose system . 
  It is negatively autoregulated   and coordinately represses transcription of a divergent operon that encodes a maltose-glucose PTS permease and a bifunctional protein that interacts directly with MalT transcriptional activator  .
