DNA-binding protein under anaerobic conditions , Dan , formerly TtdR or YgiP ,  is an LysR-type transcriptional regulator  for  L-tartrate fermentation  . 
Dan  belongs to same family of growth phase-specific nucleoid proteins as Fis , Dps , HU , IHF , and H-NS . 
More specifically , Dan belongs to group II nucleoid proteins , which include Fis , Rob -LRB- CbpB -RRB- , CbpA , and IciA and show irregular distribution within nucleoid  .
