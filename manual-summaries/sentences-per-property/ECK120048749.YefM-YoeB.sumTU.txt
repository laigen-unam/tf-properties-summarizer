YoeB enhances interaction with YefM by affecting YefM conformation to one that is more favorable for DNA binding and/or by stabilizing nucleoprotein complex at operator site and reducing basal expression of  yefM-yoeB operon  . 
 yefM gene is upregulated during growth in biofilms and yefM-yoeB is upregulated in persister cells  it is probable that derepression of yefM-yoeB autoregulation occurs in se circumstances in response to an as-yet-unknown environmental or cell cycle signal -LRB- s -RRB- that interferes with YefM-YoeB-operator interaction .
