 NorR is a σ54-dependent transcriptional activator . 
It contains three domains : an N-terminal GAF -LRB- cGMP phosphodiesterase , adenylate cyclase , FhlA -RRB- domain that is involved in signal sensing a central catalytic AAA + domain that is required for interacting with σ54 and for coupling ATP hydrolysis to promoter DNA melting by RNA polymerase ; and a C-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif . 
 In absence of NO , activity of central catalytic AAA + domain of NorR is repressed by direct interaction between GAF domain and σ54-interacting region of AAA + domain . 
This interaction prevents access to σ54-RNA polymerase complex . 
Binding of NO relieves intramolecular repression and activates ATPase activity of central AAA + domain  . 
GAF domain contains a mononuclear nonheme iron center that binds NO reversibly . 
Spectroscopy studies and structural modeling of GAF domain identified five candidate ligands for nonheme iron and suggested a model in which it is coordinated in a pseudo-octahedral environment by three aspartate residues , an arginine , and a cysteine . 
iron oxidation state influences activation of NorR  . 
 Binding of NO to GAF domain relieves intramolecular repression of central domain , leading to activation of ATPase activity and interaction with σ54 RNA polymerase  .
