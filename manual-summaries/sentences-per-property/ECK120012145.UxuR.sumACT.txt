 This protein negatively regulates its own synsis  , and  in absence of fructuronate it represses transcription of cluster of operons involved in  transport and degradation of sugar acids Î²-D-glucuronides , glucuronate , and gluconate   . 
 This regulator is subject to catabolic repression in presence of glucose and at low levels of cyclic AMP  .
