transcription factor IclR , for Isocitrate lyase Regulator ,   is negatively autoregulated   and it regulates expression of  glyoxylate bypass  operon . 
 Glyoxylate and pyruvate have been identified as effectors  of IclR and show antagonistic effects . 
While  glyoxylate favors inactive dimeric state of IclR  ,  pyruvate increases binding of IclR to aceBp promoter  by stabilizing  active tetrameric form of protein  .
