 SoxS , MarA , and Rob bind as monomers to the same DNA site  , a  degenerate  20-bp sequence  known as the Mar-Sox-Rob box , which has to be in a specific orientation and distance relative to the -35 and -10 boxes of the promoter  . 
The Mar-Sox-Rob box  contains an invariant A at position 1 , two recognition elements , the RE1 at position 4-7 and RE2 at position 15-18 , and a 7-bp A/T-rich spacer separating these elements  .
