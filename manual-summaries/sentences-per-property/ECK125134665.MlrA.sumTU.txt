 Expression of mlrA gene is RpoS-regulated in an avian pathogenic E. coli strain  . 
Gmr functions as a connector and a trigger enzyme in local c-di-GMP signaling ; its direct inhibition of YdaM is relieved when it binds and degrades c-di-GMP , allowing  YdaM to activate transcription factor MlrA  .
