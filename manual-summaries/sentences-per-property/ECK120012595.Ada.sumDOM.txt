 This regulator contains two functional domains : an N-terminal domain , which contains a motif for DNA binding , and C-terminal domain , which is involved in interaction with RNA polymerase . 
This regulator  removes methyl groups -LRB- as well as larger groups -RRB- from guanine and thymine substrates and transfers m to its own cysteine residue -LRB- Cys-321 -RRB- in C-terminal domain . 
Ada protein also transfers methyl groups to a second cysteine residue -LRB- Cys-69 -RRB- in N-terminal domain , from alkylphosphotriesters in DNA   .
