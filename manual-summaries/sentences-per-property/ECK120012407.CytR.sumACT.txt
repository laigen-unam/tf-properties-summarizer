When only CRP is bound to this promoter , it functions as an activator , and n ,  when CytR binds to DNA and to CRP , activation is repressed because CytR masks an activating region of CRP that orwise would contact RNA polymerase to activate transcription  . 
CytR protein can not act alone ;  synergistic DNA binding is increased by direct interaction with CRP  . 
 CytR senses and binds  cytidine  , and when this happens cooperativity of CytR and CRP is interrupted and expression of genes is induced  .
