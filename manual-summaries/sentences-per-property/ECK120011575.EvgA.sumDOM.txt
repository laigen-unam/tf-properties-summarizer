EvgA is a  member of NarL subfamily of response regulators  ,  consisting of an N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain . 
Like BvgA , EvgA presumably is phosphorylated in a phosphorelay reaction that involves phosphotransfer from autophosphorylated transmitter domain to receiver and Hpt domain of EvgS and finally to receiver domain of EvgA  .
