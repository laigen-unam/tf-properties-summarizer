StpA protein , for Suppressor of td phenotype A , is a nucleoid-associated multifunctional protein that acts as a transcriptional repressor in  chromosomal DNA packaging and as a chaperone . 
When StpA binds DNA , it is able to form a rigid filament , and thus access to DNA is blocked . 
  This protein is negatively autoregulated   and it is involved in % Beta ; - glucoside utilization systems and homologous recombination and repair of bleomycin damage . 
Gueun % e ' ; et al. suggested that StpA may regulate expression of a tributyltin-inducible operon  .
