transcription factor SdiA , for Suppressor of cell division inhibitor ,  is possibly positively autoregulated  and controls transcription of genes involved in  cell division . 
SdiA has been shown to increase transcription from P2 promoter of ftsQAZ operon by facilitating RNA polymerase binding to promoter region . 
SdiA activates expression of ydiV , which is involved in interaction between two quorum-sensing systems  . 
In addition , SdiA also affects expression of a number of genes , including a decrease in expression of several  motility and chemotaxis genes , a pleiotropic effect over expression of genes involved in cell division , drug sensitivity , DNA replication and repair , macromolecular metabolism genes involved in glutamate-dependent acid resistance systems -LRB- AR-2 -RRB- and an increase in expression of AcrAB multidrug efflux pump proteins  .
