atoC , encoding response regulator , and atoS , encoding sensor kinase , are  located in genome upstream of atoDAEB operon  . 
 transcription of gene atoC is induced by polyamines and histamine  microarray analysis shows  that OmpR may regulate transcription of this gene . 
On or hand , it does not appear to be autoregulated  .
