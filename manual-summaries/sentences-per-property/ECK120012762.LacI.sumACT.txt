 LacI is negatively autoregulated when it binds to two DNA-binding sites , one located downstream of lacI gene and or one located in coding sequence for C terminus of LacI  . 
 Induction occurs when physiological inducer , allolactose , binds to lac repressor , preventing it from binding to operator  . 
 Nonphysiological analogs , such as thiogalactosides , can function as inducers too  .
