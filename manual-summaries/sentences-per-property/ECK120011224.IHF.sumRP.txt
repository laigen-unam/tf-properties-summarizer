IHF , Integration host factor , is a global regulatory protein that helps to maintain  DNA architecture . 
It binds and bends DNA at specific sites . 
IHF plays a role in DNA supercoilingand DNA duplex destabilization and affects processes such as DNA replication , recombination , and expression of many genes  . 
Like HU , IHF plays a role in  polyamine-dependent DNA condensation  . 
IHF is necessary for induction of  arginine - and lysine-dependent acid resistance -LRB- AR -RRB-  via both transcriptional and translational controls of gene expression , as IHF activates expression of a specific set of genes involved in  survival at extremely acidic pH  .
