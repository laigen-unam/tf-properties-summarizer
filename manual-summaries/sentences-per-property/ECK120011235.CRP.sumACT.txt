 Expression of crp is positively and negatively autoregulated ; repression of crp requires Fis  . 
 CRP is activated as a DNA-binding protein  by binding of its  allosteric effector , cAMP  . 
 In the absence of rapidly metabolizable carbon sources , such as glucose , EIIAGlc is phosphorylated and activates adenylate cyclase , resulting in an elevated level of cAMP . 
Due to the autoregulation of crp , cAMP-CRP levels increase . 
In addition , in the presence of unphosphorylated EIIAGlc , inducer is transported into the cell , leading to the inactivation of the corresponding repressor molecules  -LSB- Magasanik70 * -RSB- .
