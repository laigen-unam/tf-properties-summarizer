FUR is a sensor of concentration of intracellular iron , and  genetic repression occurs when physiological inducer ,  iron -LRB- Fe2 + -RRB-  , binds to FUR  . 
 In presence of iron , FUR binds in tandem to possible   inverted repeat sequences  in intergenic region   to repress transcription by overlapping -35 box of regulated promoter .
