IscR is a  member of Rrf2 family  and  carries a predicted N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and three conserved cysteines in its C terminus . 
IscR is a dimer in solution and it contains -LSB- 2Fe-2S -RSB- 1 + cluster when purified under anaerobic conditions . 
This -LSB- 2Fe-2S -RSB- 1 + cluster has an unusual -LRB- Cys -RRB- 3 -LRB- His -RRB- 1 ligand scheme and is essential for cluster ligation  .
