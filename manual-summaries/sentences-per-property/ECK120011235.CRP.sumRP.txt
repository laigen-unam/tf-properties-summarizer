Many of these genes are involved in  the catabolism of secondary carbon sources -LRB- for reviews , see . 
In addition , CRP is involved in many other processes , such as osmoregulation , stringent response , biofilm formation , virulence , nitrogen assimilation , iron uptake , competence , multidrug resistance to antibiotics , and expression of CyaR sRNA . 
Transcriptome analyses have been performed . 
 Expression of crp is positively and negatively autoregulated ; repression of crp requires Fis  . 
CRP activates a gene potentially related to persistence  .
