Both  dcuR , encoding response regulator , and dcuS , encoding sensor kinase , are organized in an operon  that is  located upstream of dcuB-fumB operon  , whose  expression is activated by DcuR  . 
 dcuSR operon contains two promoters , an external one that transcribes both genes and an internal  one that only transcribes to dcuR and that is activated by CRP . 
 full operon is repressed by nitrate acting through NarXL regulatory system  , so that E.coli will use nitrate as a respiratory electron acceptor before fumarate . -RSB-
