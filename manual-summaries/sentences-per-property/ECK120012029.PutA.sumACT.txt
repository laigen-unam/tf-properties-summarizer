 In absence of proline , PutA is cytoplasmic and functions as a transcriptional repressor of put regulon  . 
 In absence of proline ,  PutA binds to operator sequences in putA-putP intergenic region and represses transcription   , most likely by keeping RNA polymerase from binding to putA promoter . 
 Association of enzyme with membrane is dependent on reduction of FAD cofactor , which induces a change in conformation of protein . 
Both proline binding and FAD reduction contribute to conformational change  .
