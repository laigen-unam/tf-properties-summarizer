n ,  phosphate group is transferred from AtoS to D55 residue of AtoC to activate this protein . 
It has also been suggested that D55 residue could transfer phosphate group to H73 residue of AtoC . 
AtoC  belongs to NtrC-NifA family of σ54-RNA polymerase transcriptional activators  and , as for a number of members of this family , AtoC contains three domains : N-terminal receiver domain to be phosphorylated , central domain involved in ATP hydrolysis and interaction with σ54 , and DNA-binding C-terminal domain that contains a helix-turn-helix motif  .
