It was demonstrated in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium that LsrR directly senses and binds  molecule 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione -LRB- DPD -RRB- , phosphorylated and dephosphorylated  . 
 binding of DPD to LsrR inactivates LsrR , but phosphorylated DPD appears to specifically inactivate action of LsrR on expression of genes for autoinducer 2 uptake and processing -LRB- lsrACDBFG-tam operon -RRB- and lsrR itself  . 
This protein binds to DNA as a tetramer to regulate transcription ; however ,  in presence of phosphorylated autoinducer 2 -LRB- AI-2 -RRB- or ADP-P , tetramer dissociates into dimers , and interaction of LsrR with DNA is greatly reduced  .
